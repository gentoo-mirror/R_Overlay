		Simple tools for Open Office XML documents // This is a
		collection of some general and quite simple facilities
		accessing common elements  from within R of an Open XML
		document, Microsoft's current format. These provide examples
		for accessing the contents of the document and its meta-data.
		More will be added for modifying the content, and also reading
		richer structures such as worksheets, etc. At present, this is
		more an illustration of what is possible and a way to encourage
		others to explore these documents.  We can do very similar
		things for OpenOffice documents. (See ROpenOffice for a start.)
		Some of the functionality currently in this package will be
		moved to a separate package for Word, and some functionality
		already exists in RExcelXML. In this way, this package will
		provide the functionality common to two or more Open XML
		document formats.
