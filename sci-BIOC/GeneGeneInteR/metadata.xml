		Tools for Testing Gene-Gene Interaction at the Gene Level // The
		aim of this package is to propose several methods for testing
		gene-gene interaction in case-control association studies. Such
		a test can be done by aggregating SNP-SNP interaction tests
		performed at the SNP level (SSI) or by using gene-gene
		multidimensionnal methods (GGI) methods. The package also
		proposes tools for a graphic display of the results.
