		SparseSignatures // Point mutations occurring in a genome can be
		divided into 96 categories based on the base being mutated, the
		base it is mutated into and its two flanking bases. Therefore,
		for any patient, it is possible to represent all the point
		mutations occurring in that patients tumor as a vector of
		length 96, where each element represents the count of mutations
		for a given category in the patient. A mutational signature
		represents the pattern of mutations produced by a mutagen or
		mutagenic process inside the cell. Each signature can also be
		represented by a vector of length 96, where each element
		represents the probability that this particular mutagenic
		process generates a mutation of the 96 above mentioned
		categories. In this R package, we provide a set of functions to
		extract and visualize the mutational signatures that best
		explain the mutation counts of a large number of patients.
