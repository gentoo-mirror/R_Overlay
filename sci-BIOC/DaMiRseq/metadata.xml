		Data Mining for RNA-seq data: normalization, feature selection
		and classification // The DaMiRseq package offers a tidy
		pipeline of data mining procedures to identify transcriptional
		biomarkers and exploit them for both binary and multi-class
		classification purposes. The package accepts any kind of data
		presented as a table of raw counts and allows including both
		continous and factorial variables that occur with the
		experimental setting. A series of functions enable the user to
		clean up the data by filtering genomic features and samples, to
		adjust data by identifying and removing the unwanted source of
		variation (i.e. batches and confounding factors) and to select
		the best predictors for modeling. Finally, a "stacking"
		ensemble learning technique is applied to build a robust
		classification model. Every step includes a checkpoint that the
		user may exploit to assess the effects of data management by
		looking at diagnostic plots, such as clustering and heatmaps,
		RLE boxplots, MDS or correlation plot.
