		The removal of batch effects from datasets using a PCA and
		constrained optimisation based technique // Harman is a PCA and
		constrained optimisation based technique that maximises the
		removal of batch effects from datasets, with the constraint
		that the probability of overcorrection (i.e. removing genuine
		biological signal along with batch noise) is kept to a fraction
		which is set by the end-user.
