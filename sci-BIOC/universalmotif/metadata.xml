		Import, Modify, and Export Motifs with R // Allows for importing
		most common motif types into R for use by functions provided by
		other Bioconductor motif-related packages. Motifs can be
		exported into most major motif formats from various classes as
		defined by other Bioconductor packages. A suite of motif and
		sequence manipulation and analysis functions are included,
		including enrichment, comparison, P-value calculation,
		shuffling, trimming, higher-order motifs, and others.
