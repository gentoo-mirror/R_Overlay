		Identifies cell population in flow cytometry data. // Samples
		large data such that spectral clustering is possible while
		preserving density information in edge weights. More
		specifically, given a matrix of coordinates as input,
		SamSPECTRAL first builds the communities to sample the data
		points. Then, it builds a graph and after weighting the edges
		by conductance computation, the graph is passed to a classic
		spectral clustering algorithm to find the spectral clusters.
		The last stage of SamSPECTRAL is to combine the spectral
		clusters. The resulting "connected components" estimate
		biological cell populations in the data sample. For
		instructions on manual installation, refer to the PDF file
		provided in the following documentation.
