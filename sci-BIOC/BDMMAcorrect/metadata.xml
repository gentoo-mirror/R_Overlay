		Meta-analysis for the metagenomic read counts data from different
		cohorts // Metagenomic sequencing techniques enable
		quantitative analyses of the microbiome. However, combining the
		microbial data from these experiments is challenging due to the
		variations between experiments. The existing methods for
		correcting batch effects do not consider the interactions
		between variablesmicrobial taxa in microbial studiesand the
		overdispersion of the microbiome data. Therefore, they are not
		applicable to microbiome data. We develop a new method,
		Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression meta-analysis
		(BDMMA), to simultaneously model the batch effects and detect
		the microbial taxa associated with phenotypes. BDMMA
		automatically models the dependence among microbial taxa and is
		robust to the high dimensionality of the microbiome and their
		association sparsity.
