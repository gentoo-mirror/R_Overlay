		ANalysis Of Translational Activity (ANOTA). // Genome wide
		studies of translational control is emerging as a tool to study
		verious biological conditions. The output from such analysis is
		both the mRNA level (e.g. cytosolic mRNA level) and the levl of
		mRNA actively involved in translation (the actively translating
		mRNA level) for each mRNA. The standard analysis of such data
		strives towards identifying differential translational between
		two or more sample classes - i.e. differences in actively
		translated mRNA levels that are independent of underlying
		differences in cytosolic mRNA levels. This package allows for
		such analysis using partial variances and the random variance
		model. As 10s of thousands of mRNAs are analyzed in parallell
		the library performs a number of tests to assure that the data
		set is suitable for such analysis.
