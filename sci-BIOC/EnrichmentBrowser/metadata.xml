		Seamless navigation through combined results of set-based and
		network-based enrichment analysis // The EnrichmentBrowser
		package implements essential functionality for the enrichment
		analysis of gene expression data. The analysis combines the
		advantages of set-based and network-based enrichment analysis
		in order to derive high-confidence gene sets and biological
		pathways that are differentially regulated in the expression
		data under investigation. Besides, the package facilitates the
		visualization and exploration of such sets and pathways.
