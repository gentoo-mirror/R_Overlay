		SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 130) // SNP locations
		and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build
		130. The source data files used for this package were created
		by NCBI on 5-6 May, 2009, and contain SNPs mapped to reference
		genome NCBI Build 36.1, which is identical to the hg18 genome
		from UCSC. Therefore, the SNPs in this package can be
		"injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg18 and they will land at
		the correct location.
