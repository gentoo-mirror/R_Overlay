		f-divergence Cutoff Index // (f-divergence Cutoff Index), is to
		find DEGs in the transcriptomic  proteomic data, and identify
		DEGs by computing the difference between the distribution of
		fold-changes for the control-control and remaining (non-
		differential) case-control gene expression ratio data. fCI
		provides several advantages compared to existing methods.
