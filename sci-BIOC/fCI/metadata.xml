		f-divergence Cutoff Index for Differential Expression Analysis in
		Transcriptomics and Proteomics // (f-divergence Cutoff Index),
		is to find DEGs in the transcriptomic  proteomic data, and
		identify DEGs by computing the difference between the
		distribution of fold-changes for the control-control and
		remaining (non-differential) case-control gene expression ratio
		data. fCI provides several advantages compared to existing
		methods.
