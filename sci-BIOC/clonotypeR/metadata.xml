		High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor sequences //
		High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor sequences
		The genes encoding T cell receptors are created by somatic
		recombination, generating an immense combination of V, (D) and
		J segments. Additional processes during the recombination
		create extra sequence diversity between the V an J segments.
		Collectively, this hyper-variable region is called the CDR3
		loop. The purpose of this package is to process and
		quantitatively analyse millions of V-CDR3-J combination, called
		clonotypes, from multiple sequence libraries.
