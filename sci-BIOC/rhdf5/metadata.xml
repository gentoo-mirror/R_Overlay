		R Interface to HDF5 // This package provides an interface between
		HDF5 and R. HDF5's main features are the ability to store and
		access very large and/or complex datasets and a wide variety of
		metadata on mass storage (disk) through a completely portable
		file format. The rhdf5 package is thus suited for the exchange
		of large and/or complex datasets between R and other software
		package, and for letting R applications work on datasets that
		are larger than the available RAM.
