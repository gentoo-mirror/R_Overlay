		HDF5 interface to R // This R/Bioconductor package provides an
		interface between HDF5 and R. HDF5's main features are the
		ability to store and access very large and/or complex datasets
		and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) through a
		completely portable file format. The rhdf5 package is thus
		suited for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets
		between R and other software package, and for letting R
		applications work on datasets that are larger than the
		available RAM.
