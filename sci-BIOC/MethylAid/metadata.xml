		Methylation array data sets // A visual and interactive web
		application using RStudio's shiny package. Bad quality samples
		are detected using sample-dependent and sample-independent
		controls present on the array and user adjustable thresholds.
		In depth exploration of bad quality samples can be performed
		using several interactive diagnostic plots of the quality
		control probes present on the array. Furthermore, the impact of
		any batch effect provided by the user can be explored.
