		Data preprocessing and quality control for Illumina
		HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC BeadChip // The ENmix
		package provides a set of quality control and data pre-
		processing tools for Illumina HumanMethylation450 and
		MethylationEPIC Beadchips. It includes ENmix background
		correction, RELIC dye bias correction, RCP probe-type bias
		adjustment, along with a number of additional tools. These
		functions can be used to remove unwanted experimental noise and
		thus to improve accuracy and reproducibility of methylation
		measures. ENmix functions are flexible and transparent. Users
		have option to choose a single pipeline command to finish all
		data pre-processing steps (including background correction,
		dye-bias adjustment, inter-array normalization and probe-type
		bias correction) or to use individual functions sequentially to
		perform data pre-processing in a more customized manner. In
		addition the ENmix package has selectable complementary
		functions for efficient data visualization (such as data
		distribution plots); quality control (identifing and filtering
		low quality data points, samples, probes, and outliers, along
		with imputation of missing values); identification of probes
		with multimodal distributions due to SNPs or other factors;
		exploration of data variance structure using principal
		component regression analysis plot; preparation of experimental
		factors related surrogate control variables to be adjusted in
		downstream statistical analysis; and an efficient algorithm
		oxBS-MLE to estimate 5-methylcytosine and
		5-hydroxymethylcytosine level.
