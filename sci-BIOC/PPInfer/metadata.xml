		Inferring functionally related proteins using protein interaction
		networks // Interactions between proteins occur in many, if not
		most, biological processes. Most proteins perform their
		functions in networks associated with other proteins and other
		biomolecules. This fact has motivated the development of a
		variety of experimental methods for the identification of
		protein interactions. This variety has in turn ushered in the
		development of numerous different computational approaches for
		modeling and predicting protein interactions. Sometimes an
		experiment is aimed at identifying proteins closely related to
		some interesting proteins. A network based statistical learning
		method is used to infer the putative functions of proteins from
		the known functions of its neighboring proteins on a PPI
		network. This package identifies such proteins often involved
		in the same or similar biological functions.
