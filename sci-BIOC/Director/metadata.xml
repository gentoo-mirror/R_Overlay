		A dynamic visualization tool of multi-level data // Director is
		an R package designed to streamline the visualization of
		molecular effects in regulatory cascades. It utilizes the R
		package htmltools and a modified Sankey plugin of the
		JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and easy, browser-
		enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting
		downstream effects of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules.
		The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged as highly-
		portable HTML files that eliminate the need for third-party
		software to view. This enables a straightforward approach for
		scientists to interpret the data produced, and bioinformatics
		developers an alternative means to present relevant data.
