		Integration of CellNOptR to add missing links // This package
		integrates literature-constrained and data-driven methods to
		infer signalling networks from perturbation experiments. It
		permits to extends a given network with links derived from the
		data via various inference methods and uses information on
		physical interactions of proteins to guide and validate the
		integration of links.
