		Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures // Functions
		implementing the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures
		method (SAPS). SAPS provides a robust method for identifying
		biologically significant gene sets associated with patient
		survival. Three basic statistics are computed. First, patients
		are clustered into two survival groups based on differential
		expression of a candidate gene set. P_pure is calculated as the
		probability of no survival difference between the two groups.
		Next, the same procedure is applied to randomly generated gene
		sets, and P_random is calculated as the proportion achieving a
		P_pure as significant as the candidate gene set. Finally, a
		pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is performed by
		ranking all genes by concordance index, and P_enrich is
		computed to indicate the degree to which the candidate gene set
		is enriched for genes with univariate prognostic significance.
		A SAPS_score is calculated to summarize the three statistics,
		and optionally a Q-value is computed to estimate the
		significance of the SAPS_score by calculating SAPS_scores for
		random gene sets.
