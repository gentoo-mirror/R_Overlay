		Active modules for multilayer weighted gene co-expression
		networks: a continuous optimization approach // A pure data-
		driven gene network, weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN)
		could be constructed only from expression profile. Different
		layers in such networks may represent different time points,
		multiple conditions or various species. AMOUNTAIN aims to
		search active modules in multi-layer WGCN using a continuous
		optimization approach.
