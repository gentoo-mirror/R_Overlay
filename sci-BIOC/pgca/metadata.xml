		PGCA: An Algorithm to Link Protein Groups Created from MS/MS Data
		// Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) is a computationally
		inexpensive algorithm to merge protein summaries from multiple
		experimental quantitative proteomics data. The algorithm
		connects two or more groups with overlapping accession numbers.
		In some cases, pairwise groups are mutually exclusive but they
		may still be connected by another group (or set of groups) with
		overlapping accession numbers. Thus, groups created by PGCA
		from multiple experimental runs (i.e., global groups) are
		called "connected" groups. These identified global protein
		groups enable the analysis of quantitative data available for
		protein groups instead of unique protein identifiers.
