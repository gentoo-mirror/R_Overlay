		systemPipeR: NGS workflow and report generation environment // R
		package for building and running automated end-to-end analysis
		workflows for a wide range of next generation sequence (NGS)
		applications such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and Ribo-Seq.
		Important features include a uniform workflow interface across
		different NGS applications, automated report generation, and
		support for running both R and command-line software, such as
		NGS aligners or peak/variant callers, on local computers or
		compute clusters. Efficient handling of complex sample sets and
		experimental designs is facilitated by a consistently
		implemented sample annotation infrastructure. Instructions for
		using systemPipeR are given in the Overview Vignette (HTML).
		The remaining Vignettes, linked below, are workflow templates
		for common NGS use cases.
