		Cancer Variant Explorer // Shiny app for interactive variant
		prioritisation in precision oncology. The input file for CVE is
		the output file of the recently released Oncotator Variant
		Annotation tool summarising variant-centric information from 14
		different publicly available resources relevant for cancer
		researches. Interactive priortisation in CVE is based on known
		germline and cancer variants, DNA repair genes and functional
		prediction scores. An optional feature of CVE is the
		exploration of the tumour-specific pathway context that is
		facilitated using co-expression modules generated from publicly
		available transcriptome data. Finally druggability of
		prioritised variants is assessed using the Drug Gene
		Interaction Database (DGIdb).
