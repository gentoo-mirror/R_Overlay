		Evaluation of normalization methods and calculation of
		differential expression analysis statistics // NormalyzerDE
		provides screening of normalization methods for LC-MS based
		expression data. It calculates a range of normalized matrices
		using both existing approaches and a novel time-segmented
		approach, calculates performance measures and generates an
		evaluation report. Furthermore, it provides an easy utility for
