		Analysis tools for single-cell expression experiments. // Monocle
		performs differential expression and time-series analysis for
		single-cell expression experiments. It orders individual cells
		according to progress through a biological process, without
		knowing ahead of time which genes define progress through that
		process. Monocle also performs differential expression
		analysis, clustering, visualization, and other useful tasks on
		single cell expression data.  It is designed to work with RNA-
		Seq and qPCR data, but could be used with other types as well.
