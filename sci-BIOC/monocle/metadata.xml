		Clustering, differential expression, and trajectory analysis for
		single- cell RNA-Seq // Monocle performs differential
		expression and time-series analysis for single-cell expression
		experiments. It orders individual cells according to progress
		through a biological process, without knowing ahead of time
		which genes define progress through that process. Monocle also
		performs differential expression analysis, clustering,
		visualization, and other useful tasks on single cell expression
		data.  It is designed to work with RNA-Seq and qPCR data, but
		could be used with other types as well.
