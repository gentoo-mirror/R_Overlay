		Fast Methylome-Wide Association Study Pipeline for Enrichment
		Platforms // A complete toolset for methylome-wide association
		studies (MWAS). It is specifically designed for data from
		enrichment based methylation assays, but can be applied to
		other data as well. The analysis pipeline includes seven steps:
		(1) scanning aligned reads from BAM files, (2) calculation of
		quality control measures, (3) creation of methylation score
		(coverage) matrix, (4) principal component analysis for
		capturing batch effects and detection of outliers, (5)
		association analysis with respect to phenotypes of interest
		while correcting for top PCs and known covariates, (6)
		annotation of significant findings, and (7) multi-marker
		analysis (methylation risk score) using elastic net.
		Additionally, RaMWAS include tools for joint analysis of
		methlyation and genotype data. This work is published in
		Bioinformatics, Shabalin et al. (2018)
