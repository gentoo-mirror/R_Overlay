		Multiple Sequence Alignment // The 'msa' package provides a
		unified R/Bioconductor interface to the multiple sequence
		alignment algorithms ClustalW, ClustalOmega, and Muscle. All
		three algorithms are integrated in the package, therefore, they
		do not depend on any external software tools and are available
		for all major platforms. The multiple sequence alignment
		algorithms are complemented by a function for pretty-printing
		multiple sequence alignments using the LaTeX package TeXshade.
