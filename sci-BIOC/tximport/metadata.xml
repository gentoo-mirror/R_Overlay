		Import and summarize transcript-level estimates for transcript-
		and gene-level analysis // Imports transcript-level abundance,
		estimated counts and transcript lengths, and summarizes into
		matrices for use with downstream gene-level analysis packages.
		Average transcript length, weighted by sample-specific
		transcript abundance estimates, is provided as a matrix which
		can be used as an offset for different expression of gene-level
		counts.
