		Fast Permutation-based Gene Set Analysis // GSALightning provides
		a fast implementation of permutation-based gene set analysis
		for two-sample problem. This package is particularly useful
		when testing simultaneously a large number of gene sets, or
		when a large number of permutations is necessary for more
		accurate p-values estimation.
