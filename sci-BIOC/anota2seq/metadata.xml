		Generally applicable transcriptome-wide analysis of translational
		efficiency using anota2seq // anota2seq provides analysis of
		translational efficiency and differential expression analysis
		for  polysome-profiling and ribosome-profiling studies (two or
		more sample classes) quantified by RNA sequencing or DNA-
		microarray. Polysome-profiling and ribosome-profiling typically
		generate data for two RNA sources; translated mRNA and total
		mRNA. Analysis of differential expression is used to estimate
		changes within each RNA source (i.e. translated mRNA or total
		mRNA). Analysis of translational efficiency aims to identify
		changes in translation efficiency leading to altered protein
		levels that are independent of total mRNA levels (i.e. changes
		in translated mRNA that are independent of levels of total
		mRNA) or buffering, a mechanism regulating translational
		efficiency so that protein levels remain constant despite
		fluctuating total mRNA levels (i.e. changes in total mRNA that
		are independent of levels of translated mRNA). anota2seq
		applies analysis of partial variance and the random variance
		model to fulfill these tasks.
