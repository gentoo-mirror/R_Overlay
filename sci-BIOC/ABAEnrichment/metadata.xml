		Gene expression enrichment in human brain regions // The package
		ABAEnrichment is designed to test for enrichment of user
		defined candidate genes in the set of expressed genes in
		different human brain regions. The core function 'aba_enrich'
		integrates the expression of the candidate gene set (averaged
		across donors) and the structural information of the brain
		using an ontology, both provided by the Allen Brain Atlas
		project. 'aba_enrich' interfaces the ontology enrichment
		software FUNC to perform the statistical analyses. Additional
		functions provided in this package like 'get_expression' and
		'plot_expression' facilitate exploring the expression data, and
		besides the standard candidate vs. background gene set
		enrichment, also three additional tests are implemented, e.g.
		for cases when genes are ranked instead of divided into
		candidate and background.
