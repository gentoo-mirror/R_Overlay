		Bias-free Footprint Enrichment Test // BiFET identifies TFs whose
		footprints are over-represented in target regions compared to
		background regions after correcting for the bias arising from
		the imbalance in read counts and GC contents between the target
		and background regions. For a given TF k, BiFET tests the null
		hypothesis that the target regions have the same probability of
		having footprints for the TF k as the background regions while
		correcting for the read count and GC content bias. For this, we
		use the number of target regions with footprints for TF k, t_k
		as a test statistic and calculate the p-value as the
		probability of observing t_k or more target regions with
		footprints under the null hypothesis.
