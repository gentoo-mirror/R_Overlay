		Package analyse 4C sequencing data // FourCSeq is an R package
		dedicated to the analysis of (multiplexed) 4C sequencing data.
		The package provides a pipeline to detect specific interactions
		between DNA elements and identify differential interactions
		between conditions. The statistical analysis in R starts with
		individual bam files for each sample as inputs. To obtain these
		files, the package contains a python script
		(extdata/python/demultiplex.py) to demultiplex libraries and
		trim off primer sequences. With a standard alignment software
		the required bam files can be then be generated.
