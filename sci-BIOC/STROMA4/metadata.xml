		Assign Properties to TNBC Patients // This package estimates four
		stromal properties identified in TNBC patients in each patient
		of a gene expression datasets. These stromal property
		assignments can be combined to subtype patients. These four
		stromal properties were identified in Triple negative breast
		cancer (TNBC) patients and represent the presence of different
		cells in the stroma: T-cells (T), B-cells (B), stromal
		infiltrating epithelial cells (E), and desmoplasia (D).
		Additionally this package can also be used to estimate
		generative properties for the Lehmann subtypes, an alternative
		TNBC subtyping scheme (PMID: 21633166).
