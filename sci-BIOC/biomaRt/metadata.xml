		Interface to BioMart databases (i.e. Ensembl) // In recent years
		a wealth of biological data has become available in public data
		repositories. Easy access to these valuable data resources and
		firm integration with data analysis is needed for comprehensive
		bioinformatics data analysis.  biomaRt provides an interface to
		a growing collection of databases implementing the BioMart
		software suite (http://www.biomart.org). The package enables
		retrieval of large amounts of data in a uniform way without the
		need to know the underlying database schemas or write complex
		SQL queries. The most prominent examples of BioMart databases
		are maintain by Ensembl, which provides biomaRt users direct
		access to a diverse set of data and enables a wide range of
		powerful online queries from gene annotation to database
		mining.
