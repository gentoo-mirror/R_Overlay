		Find SNV/Indel differences between two bam files with near
		relationship // This package is to find SNV/Indel differences
		between two bam files with near relationship in a way of
		pairwise comparison thourgh each base position across the
		genome region of interest. The difference is inferred by fisher
		test and euclidean distance, the input of which is the base
		count (A,T,G,C) in a given position and read counts for indels
		that span no less than 2bp on both sides of indel region.
