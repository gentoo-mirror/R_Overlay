		Gene expression-based subtype classification for high-grade
		serous ovarian cancer // This package implements four major
		subtype classifiers for high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer
		as described by Helland et al. (PLoS One, 2011), Bentink et al.
		(PLoS One, 2012), Verhaak et al. (J Clin Invest, 2013), and
		Konecny et al. (J Natl Cancer Inst, 2014). In addition, the
		package implements a consensus classifier, which consolidates
		and improves on the robustness of the proposed subtype
		classifiers, thereby providing reliable stratification of
		patients with HGS ovarian tumors of clearly defined subtype.
