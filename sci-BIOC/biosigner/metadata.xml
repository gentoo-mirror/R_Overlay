		Signature discovery from omics data // Feature selection is
		critical in omics data analysis to extract restricted and
		meaningful molecular signatures from complex and high-dimension
		data, and to build robust classifiers. This package implements
		a new method to assess the relevance of the variables for the
		prediction performances of the classifier. The approach can be
		run in parallel with the PLS-DA, Random Forest, and SVM binary
		classifiers. The signatures and the corresponding 'restricted'
		models are returned, enabling future predictions on new
		datasets. A Galaxy implementation of the package is available
		within the Workflow4metabolomics.org online infrastructure for
		computational metabolomics.
