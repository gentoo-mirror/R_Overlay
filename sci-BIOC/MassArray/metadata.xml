		Analytical Tools for MassArray Data // This package is designed
		for the import, quality control, analysis, and visualization of
		methylation data generated using Sequenom's MassArray platform.
		The tools herein contain a highly detailed amplicon prediction
		for optimal assay design.  Also included are quality control
		measures of data, such as primer dimer and bisulfite conversion
		efficiency estimation.  Methylation data are calculated using
		the same algorithms contained in the EpiTyper software package.
		Additionally, automatic SNP-detection can be used to flag
		potentially confounded data from specific CG sites.
		Visualization includes barplots of methylation data as well as
		UCSC Genome Browser-compatible BED tracks.  Multiple assays can
		be positionally combined for integrated analysis.
