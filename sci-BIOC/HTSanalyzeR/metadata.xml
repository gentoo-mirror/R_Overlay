		Gene set over-representation, enrichment and network analyses for
		high-throughput screens // This package provides classes and
		methods for gene set over-representation, enrichment and
		network analyses on high-throughput screens. The over-
		representation analysis is performed based on hypergeometric
		tests. The enrichment analysis is based on the GSEA algorithm
		(Subramanian et al. PNAS 2005). The network analysis identifies
		enriched subnetworks based on algorithms from the BioNet
		package (Beisser et al., Bioinformatics 2010). A pipeline is
		also specifically designed for cellHTS2 object to perform
		integrative network analyses of high-throughput RNA
		interference screens. The users can build their own analysis
		pipeline for their own data set based on this package.
