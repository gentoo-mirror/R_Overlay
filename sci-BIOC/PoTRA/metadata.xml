		PoTRA: Pathways of Topological Rank Analysis // The PoTRA
		analysis is based on topological ranks of genes in biological
		pathways. PoTRA can be used to detect pathways involved in
		disease (Li, Liu  Dinu, 2018). We use PageRank to measure the
		relative topological ranks of genes in each biological pathway,
		then select hub genes for each pathway, and use Fishers Exact
		test to determine if the number of hub genes in each pathway is
		altered from normal to cancer (Li, Liu  Dinu, 2018).
		Alternatively, if the distribution of topological ranks of gene
		in a pathway is altered between normal and cancer, this pathway
		might also be involved in cancer (Li, Liu  Dinu, 2018). Hence,
		we use the KolmogorovSmirnov test to detect pathways that have
		an altered distribution of topological ranks of genes between
		two phenotypes (Li, Liu  Dinu, 2018). PoTRA can be used with
		the KEGG, Biocarta, Reactome, NCI, SMPDB and PharmGKB databases
		from the devel graphite library.
