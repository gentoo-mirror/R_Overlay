		InPAS: a bioconductor package for the identification of novel
		alternative PolyAdenylation Sites (PAS) using RNA-seq data //
		Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is one of the important post-
		transcriptional regulation mechanisms which occurs in most
		human genes. InPAS facilitates the discovery of novel APA sites
		and the differential usage of APA sites from RNA-Seq data. It
		leverages cleanUpdTSeq to fine tune identified APA sites by
		removing false sites due to internal-priming.
