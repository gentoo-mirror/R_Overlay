		Massive and Integrative Gene Set Analysis // Massive and
		Integrative Gene Set Analysis. The MIGSA package allows to
		perform a massive and integrative gene set analysis over
		several expression and gene sets simultaneously. It provides a
		common gene expression analytic framework that grants a
		comprehensive and coherent analysis. Only a minimal user
		parameter setting is required to perform both singular and gene
		set enrichment analyses in an integrative manner by means of
		the best available methods, i.e. dEnricher and mGSZ
		respectively. The greatest strengths of this big omics data
		tool are the availability of several functions to explore,
		analyze and visualize its results in order to facilitate the
		data mining task over huge information sources. MIGSA package
		also provides several functions that allow to easily load the
		most updated gene sets from several repositories.
