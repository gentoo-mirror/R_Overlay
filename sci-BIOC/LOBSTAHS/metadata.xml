		Lipid and Oxylipin Biomarker Screening through Adduct Hierarchy
		Sequences // LOBSTAHS is a multifunction package for screening,
		annotation, and putative identification of mass spectral
		features in large, HPLC-MS lipid datasets. In silico data for a
		wide range of lipids, oxidized lipids, and oxylipins can be
		generated from user-supplied structural criteria with a
		database generation function. LOBSTAHS then applies these
		databases to assign putative compound identities to features in
		any high-mass accuracy dataset that has been processed using
		xcms and CAMERA. Users can then apply a series of orthogonal
		screening criteria based on adduct ion formation patterns,
		chromatographic retention time, and other properties, to
		evaluate and assign confidence scores to this list of
		preliminary assignments. During the screening routine, LOBSTAHS
		rejects assignments that do not meet the specified criteria,
		identifies potential isomers and isobars, and assigns a variety
		of annotation codes to assist the user in evaluating the
		accuracy of each assignment.
