		Transcriptional analysis based on transcriptograms // R package
		for transcriptional analysis based on transcriptograms, a
		method to analyze transcriptomes that projects expression
		values on a set of ordered proteins, arranged such that the
		probability that gene products participate in the same
		metabolic pathway exponentially decreases with the increase of
		the distance between two proteins of the ordering.
		Transcriptograms are, hence, genome wide gene expression
		profiles that provide a global view for the cellular
		metabolism, while indicating gene sets whose expression are
		altered.
