		Batch annotation of the peaks identified from either ChIP-seq,
		ChIP-chip experiments or any experiments resulted in large
		number of chromosome ranges // The package includes functions
		to retrieve the sequences around the peak, obtain enriched Gene
		Ontology (GO) terms, find the nearest gene, exon, miRNA or
		custom features such as most conserved elements and other
		transcription factor binding sites supplied by users. Starting
		2.0.5, new functions have been added for finding the peaks with
		bi-directional promoters with summary statistics
		(peaksNearBDP), for summarizing the occurrence of motifs in
		peaks (summarizePatternInPeaks) and for adding other IDs to
		annotated peaks or enrichedGO (addGeneIDs). This package
		leverages the biomaRt, IRanges, Biostrings, BSgenome, GO.db,
		multtest and stat packages.
