		Detect tissue heterogeneity in expression profiles with gene sets
		// BioQC performs quality control of high-throughput expression
		data based on tissue gene signatures. It can detect tissue
		heterogeneity in gene expression data. The core algorithm is a
		Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test that is optimised for high
		performance.
