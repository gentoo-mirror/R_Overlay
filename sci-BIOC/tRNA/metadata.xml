		Analyzing tRNA sequences and structures // The tRNA package
		allows tRNA sequences and structures to be accessed and used
		for subsetting. In addition, it provides visualization tools to
		compare feature parameters of multiple tRNA sets and correlate
		them to additional data. The tRNA package uses GRanges objects
		as inputs requiring only few additional column data sets.
