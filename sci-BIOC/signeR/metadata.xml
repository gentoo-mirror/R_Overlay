		Empirical Bayesian approach to mutational signature discovery //
		The signeR package provides an empirical Bayesian approach to
		mutational signature discovery. It is designed to analyze
		single nucleotide variaton (SNV) counts in cancer genomes, but
		can also be applied to other features as well. Functionalities
		to characterize signatures or genome samples according to
		exposure patterns are also provided.
