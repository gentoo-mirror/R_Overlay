		Methods for analyzing microarray data using Local Pooled Error
		(LPE) method // This LPE library is used to do significance
		analysis of microarray data with small number of replicates. It
		uses resampling based FDR adjustment, and gives less
		conservative results than traditional 'BH' or 'BY' procedures.
		Data accepted is raw data in txt format from MAS4, MAS5 or
		dChip. Data can also be supplied after normalization. LPE
		library is primarily used for analyzing data between two
		conditions. To use it for paired data, see LPEP library. For
		using LPE in multiple conditions, use HEM library.
