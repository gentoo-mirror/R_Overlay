		Gene set analysis methods for SNP association p-values that lie
		in genes in given gene sets // Gene set analysis methods exist
		to combine SNP-level association p-values into gene sets,
		calculating a single association p-value for each gene set.
		This package implements two such methods that require only the
		calculated SNP p-values, the gene set(s) of interest, and a
		correlation matrix (if desired). One method (GLOSSI) requires
		independent SNPs and the other (VEGAS) can take into account
		correlation (LD) among the SNPs. Built-in plotting functions
		are available to help users visualize results.
