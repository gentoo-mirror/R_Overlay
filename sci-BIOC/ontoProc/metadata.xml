		processing of ontologies of anatomy, cell lines, and so on //
		Support harvesting of diverse bioinformatic ontologies, making
		particular use of the ontologyIndex package on CRAN. We provide
		snapshots of key ontologies for terms about cells, cell lines,
		chemical compounds, and anatomy, to help analyze genome-scale
		experiments, particularly cell x compound screens.  Another
		purpose is to strengthen development of compelling use cases
		for richer interfaces to emerging ontologies.
