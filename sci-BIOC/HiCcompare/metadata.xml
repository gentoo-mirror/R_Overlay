		HiCcompare: Joint normalization and comparative analysis of
		multiple Hi-C datasets // HiCcompare provides functions for
		joint normalization and difference detection in multiple Hi-C
		datasets. HiCcompare operates on processed Hi-C data in the
		form of chromosome-specific chromatin interaction matrices. It
		accepts three-column tab-separated text files storing chromatin
		interaction matrices in a sparse matrix format which are
		available from several sources. HiCcompare is designed to give
		the user the ability to perform a comparative analysis on the
		3-Dimensional structure of the genomes of cells in different
		biological states.`HiCcompare` differs from other packages that
		attempt to compare Hi-C data in that it works on processed data
		in chromatin interaction matrix format instead of pre-processed
		sequencing data. In addition, `HiCcompare` provides a non-
		parametric method for the joint normalization and removal of
		biases between two Hi-C datasets for the purpose of comparative
		analysis. `HiCcompare` also provides a simple yet robust method
		for detecting differences between Hi-C datasets.
