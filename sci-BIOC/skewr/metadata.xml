		Visualize Intensities Produced by Illumina's Human Methylation
		450k BeadChip // The skewr package is a tool for visualizing
		the output of the Illumina Human Methylation 450k BeadChip to
		aid in quality control. It creates a panel of nine plots. Six
		of the plots represent the density of either the methylated
		intensity or the unmethylated intensity given by one of three
		subsets of the 485,577 total probes. These subsets include Type
		I-red, Type I-green, and Type II.The remaining three
		distributions give the density of the Beta-values for these
		same three subsets. Each of the nine plots optionally displays
		the distributions of the "rs" SNP probes and the probes
		associated with imprinted genes as series of 'tick' marks
		located above the x-axis.
