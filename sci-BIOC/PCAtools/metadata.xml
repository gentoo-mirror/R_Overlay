		PCAtools: everything Principal Components Analysis // Principal
		Components Analysis (PCA) is a very powerful technique that has
		wide applicability in data science, bioinformatics, and further
		afield. It was initially developed to analyse large volumes of
		data in order to tease out the differences/relationships
		between the logical entities being analysed. It extracts the
		fundamental structure of the data without the need to build any
		model to represent it. This 'summary' of the data is arrived at
		through a process of reduction that can transform the large
		number of variables into a lesser number that are uncorrelated,
		i.e., the principal components, whilst at the same time being
		capable of easy interpretation on the original data.
