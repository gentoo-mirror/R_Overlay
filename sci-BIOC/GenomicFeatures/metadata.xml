		Tools for making and manipulating transcript centric annotations
		// A set of tools and methods for making and manipulating
		transcript centric annotations. With these tools the user can
		easily download the genomic locations of the transcripts, exons
		and cds of a given organism, from either the UCSC Genome
		Browser or a BioMart database (more sources will be supported
		in the future). This information is then stored in a local
		database that keeps track of the relationship between
		transcripts, exons, cds and genes. Flexible methods are
		provided for extracting the desired features in a convenient
		format.
