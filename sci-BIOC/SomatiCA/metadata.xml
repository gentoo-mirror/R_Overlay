		SomatiCA: identifying, characterizing, and quantifying somatic
		copy number aberrations from cancer genome sequencing //
		SomatiCA is a software suite that is capable of identifying,
		characterizing, and quantifying somatic CNAs from cancer genome
		sequencing. First, it uses read depths and lesser allele
		frequencies (LAF) from mapped short sequence reads to segment
		the genome and identify candidate CNAs. Second, SomatiCA
		estimates the admixture rate from the relative copy-number
		profile of tumor-normal pair by a Bayesian finite mixture
		model. Third, SomatiCA quantifies absolute somatic copy-number
		and subclonality for each genomic segment to guide its
		characterization. Results from SomatiCA can be further
		integrated with single nucleotide variations (SNVs) to get a
		better understanding of the tumor evolution.
