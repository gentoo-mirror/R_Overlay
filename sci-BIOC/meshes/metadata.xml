		MeSH Enrichment and Semantic analyses // MeSH (Medical Subject
		Headings) is the NLM controlled vocabulary used to manually
		index articles for MEDLINE/PubMed. MeSH terms were associated
		by Entrez Gene ID by three methods, gendoo, gene2pubmed and
		RBBH. This association is fundamental for enrichment and
		semantic analyses. meshes supports enrichment analysis (over-
		representation and gene set enrichment analysis) of gene list
		or whole expression profile. The semantic comparisons of MeSH
		terms provide quantitative ways to compute similarities between
		genes and gene groups. meshes implemented five methods proposed
		by Resnik, Schlicker, Jiang, Lin and Wang respectively and
		supports more than 70 species.
