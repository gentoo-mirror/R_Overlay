		Bayesian Inference of Regulation of Transcriptional Activity //
		Expression levels of mRNA molecules are regulated by different
		processes, comprising inhibition or activation by transcription
		factors and post-transcriptional degradation by microRNAs.
		birta (Bayesian Inference of Regulation of Transcriptional
		Activity) uses the regulatory networks of TFs and miRNAs
		together with mRNA and miRNA expression data to predict
		switches in regulatory activity between two conditions. A
		Bayesian network is used to model the regulatory structure and
		Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo is applied to sample the activity
		states.
