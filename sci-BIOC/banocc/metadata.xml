		Bayesian ANalysis Of Compositional Covariance // BAnOCC is a
		package designed for compositional data, where each sample sums
		to one. It infers the approximate covariance of the
		unconstrained data using a Bayesian model coded with `rstan`.
		It provides as output the `stanfit` object as well as posterior
		median and credible interval estimates for each correlation
		element.
