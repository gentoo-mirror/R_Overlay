		Distance-correlation based Gene Set Analysis for longitudinal
		gene expression profiles // Distance-correlation based Gene Set
		Analysis for longitudinal gene expression profiles. In
		longitudinal studies, the gene expression profiles were
		collected at each visit from each subject and hence there are
		multiple measurements of the gene expression profiles for each
		subject. The dcGSA package could be used to assess the
		associations between gene sets and clinical outcomes of
		interest by fully taking advantage of the longitudinal nature
		of both the gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes.
