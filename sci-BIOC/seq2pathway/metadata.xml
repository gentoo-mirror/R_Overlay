		a novel tool for functional gene-set (or termed as pathway)
		analysis of next-generation sequencing data // Seq2pathway is a
		novel tool for functional gene-set (or termed as pathway)
		analysis of next-generation sequencing data, consisting of
		"seq2gene" and "gene2path" components. The seq2gene links
		sequence-level measurements of genomic regions (including SNPs
		or point mutation coordinates) to gene-level scores, and the
		gene2pathway summarizes gene scores to pathway-scores for each
		sample. The seq2gene has the feasibility to assign both coding
		and non-exon regions to a broader range of neighboring genes
		than only the nearest one, thus facilitating the study of
		functional non-coding regions. The gene2pathway takes into
		account the quantity of significance for gene members within a
		pathway compared those outside a pathway. The output of
		seq2pathway is a general structure of quantitative pathway-
		level scores, thus allowing one to functional interpret such
		datasets as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, GWAS, and derived from other
		next generational sequencing experiments.
