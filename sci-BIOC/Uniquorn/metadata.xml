		Identification of cancer cell lines based on their weighted
		mutational/ variational fingerprint // This packages enables
		users to identify cancer cell lines. Cancer cell line
		misidentification and cross-contamination reprents a
		significant challenge for cancer researchers. The
		identification is vital and in the frame of this package based
		on the locations/ loci of somatic and germline mutations/
		variations. The input format is vcf/ vcf.gz and the files have
		to contain a single cancer cell line sample (i.e. a single
		member/genotype/gt column in the vcf file). The implemented
		method is optimized for the Next-generation whole exome and
		whole genome DNA-sequencing technology. RNA-seq data is very
		likely to work as well but hasn't been rigiously tested yet.
		Panel-seq will require manual adjustment of thresholds
