		a package for checking high-throughput genomic data redundancy in
		meta-analysis // Meta-analysis has become a popular approach
		for high-throughput genomic data analysis because it often can
		significantly increase power to detect biological signals or
		patterns in datasets. However, when using public-available
		databases for meta-analysis, duplication of samples is an often
		encountered problem, especially for gene expression data. Not
		removing duplicates would make study results questionable. We
		developed a Bioconductor package DupChecker that efficiently
		identifies duplicated samples by generating MD5 fingerprints
		for raw data.
