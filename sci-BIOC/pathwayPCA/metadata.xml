		Integrative Pathway Analysis with Modern PCA Methodology and Gene
		Selection // Apply the Supervised PCA and Adaptive, Elastic-
		Net, Sparse PCA methods to extract principal components from
		each pathway. Use these pathway- specific principal components
		as the design matrix relating the response to each pathway.
		Return the model fit statistic p-values, and adjust these
		values for False Discovery Rate. Return a data frame of the
		pathways sorted by their adjusted p-values. This package has
		corresponding vignettes hosted in the ''User Guides'' page of
		https://gabrielodom.github.io/pathwayPCA/index.html, and the
		website for the development information is hosted at
		https://github.com/gabrielodom/pathwayPCA.
