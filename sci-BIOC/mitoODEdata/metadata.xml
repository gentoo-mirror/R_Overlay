		Experimental data associated to the paper "Dynamical modelling of
		phenotypes in a genome-wide RNAi live-cell imaging assay"
		(submitted). // This package contains the experimental data
		(assay annotation, siRNA annotation, time-lapse cell counts)
		associated to the paper "Dynamical modelling of phenotypes in a
		genome-wide RNAi live-cell imaging assay" (submitted). The data
		ultimately come from the Mitocheck assay reported in
		"Phenotypic profiling of the human genome by time-lapse
		microscopy reveals cell division genes" (Neumann, Walter et al,
		Nature 2010).
