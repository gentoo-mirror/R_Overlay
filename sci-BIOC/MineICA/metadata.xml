		Analysis of an ICA decomposition obtained on genomics data // The
		goal of MineICA is to perform Independent Component Analysis
		(ICA) on multiple transcriptome datasets, integrating
		additional data (e.g molecular, clinical and pathological).
		This Integrative ICA helps the biological interpretation of the
		components by studying their association with variables (e.g
		sample annotations) and gene sets, and enables the comparison
		of components from different datasets using correlation-based
		graph.
