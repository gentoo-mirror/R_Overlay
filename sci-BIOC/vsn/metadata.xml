		Variance stabilization and calibration for microarray data // The
		package implements a method for normalising microarray
		intensities, and works for single- and multiple-color arrays.
		It can also be used for data from other technologies, as long
		as they have similar format. The method uses a robust variant
		of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-
		multiplicative error model and affine calibration. The model
		incorporates data calibration step (a.k.a. normalization), a
		model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity
		and a variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences
		between transformed intensities are analogous to "normalized
		log-ratios". However, in contrast to the latter, their variance
		is independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive
		and specific in detecting differential transcription.
