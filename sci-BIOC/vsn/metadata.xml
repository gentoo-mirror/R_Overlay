		Variance stabilization and calibration for microarray data // The
		package implements a method for normalising microarray
		intensities, both between colours within array, and between
		arrays. The method uses a robust variant of the maximum-
		likelihood estimator for the stochastic model of microarray
		data described in the references (see vignette). The model
		incorporates data calibration (a.k.a. normalization), a model
		for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity, and a
		variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between
		transformed intensities are analogous to "normalized log-
		ratios". However, in contrast to the latter, their variance is
		independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive
		and specific in detecting differential transcription.
