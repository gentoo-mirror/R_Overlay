		A unified framework for working transparently with on-disk and
		in-memory array-like datasets // Wrapping an array-like object
		(typically an on-disk object) in a DelayedArray object allows
		one to perform common array operations on it without loading
		the object in memory. In order to reduce memory usage and
		optimize performance, operations on the object are either
		delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note
		that this also works on in-memory array-like objects like
		DataFrame objects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects,
		and ordinary arrays and data frames.
