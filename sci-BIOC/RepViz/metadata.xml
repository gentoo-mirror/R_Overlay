		Replicate oriented Visualization of a genomic region // RepViz
		enables the view of a genomic region in a simple and efficient
		way. RepViz allows simultaneous viewing of both intra- and
		intergroup variation in sequencing counts of the studied
		conditions, as well as their comparison to the output features
		(e.g. identified peaks) from user selected data analysis
		methods.The RepViz tool is primarily designed for chromatin
		data such as ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, but can also be used with
		other sequencing data such as RNA-seq, or combinations of
		different types of genomic data.
