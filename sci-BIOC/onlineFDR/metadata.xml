		Online FDR control // This package allows users to control the
		false discovery rate for online hypothesis testing, where
		hypotheses arrive sequentially in a stream, as presented by
		Javanmard and Montanari (2015, 2018) and Ramdas et al. (2017).
		In this framework, a null hypothesis is rejected based only on
		the previous decisions, as the future p-values and the number
		of hypotheses to be tested are unknown.
