		Data management and analysis of ion trees from ion-trap mass
		spectrometry // Ion fragmentation provides structural
		information for metabolite identification. This package
		provides utility functions to manage and analyse MS2/MS3
		fragmentation data from ion trap mass spectrometry. It was
		designed for high throughput metabolomics data with many
		biological samples and a large numer of ion trees collected.
		Tests have been done with data from low-resolution mass
		spectrometry but could be readily extended to precursor ion
		based fragmentation data from high resoultion mass
		spectrometry.
