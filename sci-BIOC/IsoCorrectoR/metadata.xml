		Correction for natural isotope abundance and tracer purity in MS
		and MS/MS data from stable isotope labeling experiments //
		IsoCorrectoR performs the correction of mass spectrometry data
		from stable isotope labeling/tracing metabolomics experiments
		with regard to natural isotope abundance and tracer impurity.
		Data from both MS and MS/MS measurements can be corrected (with
		any tracer isotope: 13C, 15N, 18O...), as well as high
		resolution MS data from multiple-tracer experiments (e.g. 13C
		and 15N used simultaneously). See the Bioconductor package
		IsoCorrectoRGUI for a graphical user interface to IsoCorrectoR.
