		MODA: MOdule Differential Analysis for weighted gene co-
		expression network // MODA can be used to estimate and
		construct condition-specific gene co-expression networks, and
		identify differentially expressed subnetworks as conserved or
		condition specific modules which are potentially associated
		with relevant biological processes.
