		Activity and Diversity Analysis Module Graphical User Interface
		// ADAMgui is a Graphical User Interface for the ADAM package.
		The ADAMgui package provides 2 shiny-based applications that
		allows the user to study the output of the ADAM package files
		through different plots. It's possible, for example, to choose
		a specific GFAG and observe the gene expression behavior with
		the plots created with the GFAGtargetUi function. Features such
		as differential expression and foldchange can be easily seen
		with aid of the plots made with GFAGpathUi function.
