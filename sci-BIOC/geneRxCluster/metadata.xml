		gRx Differential Clustering // Detect Differential Clustering of
		Genomic Sites such as gene therapy integrations.  The package
		provides some functions for exploring genomic insertion sites
		originating from two different sources. Possibly, the two
		sources are two different gene therapy vectors.  Vectors are
		preferred that target sensitive regions less frequently,
		motivating the search for localized clusters of insertions and
		comparison of the clusters formed by integration of different
		vectors.  Scan statistics allow the discovery of spatial
		differences in clustering and calculation of False Discovery
		Rates (FDRs) providing statistical methods for comparing
		retroviral vectors. A scan statistic for comparing two vectors
		using multiple window widths to detect clustering differentials
		and compute FDRs is implemented here.
