		Multi-Dataset Model-based Differential Expression Proteomics
		Analysis Platform // ProteoMM is a statistical method to
		perform model-based peptide-level differential expression
		analysis of single or multiple datasets. For multiple datasets
		ProteoMM produces a single fold change and p-value for each
		protein across multiple datasets. ProteoMM provides
		functionality for normalization, missing value imputation and
		differential expression. Model-based peptide-level imputation
		and differential expression analysis component of package
		follows the analysis described in A statistical framework for
		protein quantitation in bottom-up MS based proteomics"
		(Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics 2009). EigenMS normalisation
		is implemented as described in "Normalization of peak
		intensities in bottom-up MS-based proteomics using singular
		value  decomposition." (Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics
		2009).
