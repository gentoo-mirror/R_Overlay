		BayesKnockdown: Posterior Probabilities for Edges from Knockdown
		Data // A simple, fast Bayesian method for computing posterior
		probabilities for relationships between a single predictor
		variable and multiple potential outcome variables,
		incorporating prior probabilities of relationships. In the
		context of knockdown experiments, the predictor variable is the
		knocked-down gene, while the other genes are potential targets.
		Can also be used for differential expression/2-class data.
