		Adaptive penalization in high-dimensional regression and
		classification with external covariates using variational Bayes
		// This package enables regression and classification on high-
		dimensional data with different relative strengths of
		penalization for different feature groups, such as different
		assays or omic types. The optimal relative strengths are chosen
		adaptively. Optimisation is performed using a variational Bayes
		approach.
