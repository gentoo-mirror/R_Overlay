		Handling Missing Individuals in Multi-Omics Data Integration //
		The missRows package implements the MI-MFA method to deal with
		missing individuals ('biological units') in multi-omics data
		integration. The MI-MFA method generates multiple imputed
		datasets from a Multiple Factor Analysis model, then the yield
		results are combined in a single consensus solution. The
		package provides functions for estimating coordinates of
		individuals and variables, imputing missing individuals, and
		various diagnostic plots to inspect the pattern of missingness
		and visualize the uncertainty due to missing values.
