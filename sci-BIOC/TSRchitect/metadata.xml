		Promoter identification from large-scale TSS profiling data // In
		recent years, large-scale transcriptional sequence data has
		yielded considerable insights into the nature of gene
		expression and regulation in eukaryotes. Techniques that
		identify the 5' end of mRNAs, most notably CAGE, have mapped
		the promoter landscape across a number of model organisms. Due
		to the variability of TSS distributions and the transcriptional
		noise present in datasets, precisely identifying the active
		promoter(s) for genes from these datasets is not
		straightforward. TSRchitect allows the user to efficiently
		identify the putative promoter (the transcription start region,
		or TSR) from a variety of TSS profiling data types, including
		both single-end (e.g. CAGE) as well as paired-end (RAMPAGE,
		PEAT). In addition, (new with version 1.2.0) TSRchitect
		provides the ability to import aligned EST and cDNA data. Along
		with the coordiantes of identified TSRs, TSRchitect also
		calculates the width, abundance and Shape Index, and handles
		biological replicates for expression profiling. Finally,
		TSRchitect imports annotation files, allowing the user to
		associate identified promoters with genes and other genomic
		features. Three detailed examples of TSRchitect's utility are
		provided in the User's Guide, included with this package.
