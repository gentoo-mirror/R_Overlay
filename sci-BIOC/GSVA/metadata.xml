		Gene Set Variation Analysis for microarray and RNA-seq data //
		Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is a non-parametric,
		unsupervised method for estimating variation of gene set
		enrichment through the samples of a expression data set. GSVA
		performs a change in coordinate systems, transforming the data
		from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set by sample matrix,
		thereby allowing the evaluation of pathway enrichment for each
		sample. This new matrix of GSVA enrichment scores facilitates
		applying standard analytical methods like functional
		enrichment, survival analysis, clustering, CNV-pathway analysis
		or cross-tissue pathway analysis, in a pathway-centric manner.
