		Signature-based Clustering for Diagnostic Purposes // SCUDO
		(Signature-based Clustering for Diagnostic Purposes) is a rank-
		based method for the analysis of gene expression profiles for
		diagnostic and classification purposes. It is based on the
		identification of sample-specific gene signatures composed of
		the most up- and down-regulated genes for that sample. Starting
		from gene expression data, functions in this package identify
		sample-specific gene signatures and use them to build a graph
		of samples. In this graph samples are joined by edges if they
		have a similar expression profile, according to a pre-computed
		similarity matrix. The similarity between the expression
		profiles of two samples is computed using a method similar to
		GSEA. The graph of samples can then be used to perform
		community clustering or to perform supervised classification of
		samples in a testing set.
