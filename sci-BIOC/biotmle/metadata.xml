		Targeted Learning with Moderated Statistics for Biomarker
		Discovery // This package facilitates the discovery of
		biomarkers from biological sequencing data (e.g., microarrays,
		RNA-seq) based on the associations of potential biomarkers with
		exposure and outcome variables by implementing an estimation
		procedure that combines a generalization of moderated
		statistics with targeted minimum loss-based estimates (TMLE) of
		causal parameters (e.g., Average Treatment Effect) whose
		estimators admit asymptotically linear representations (in
		terms of influence functions).
