		BioMM: Biological-informed Multi-stage Machine learning framework
		for phenotype prediction using omics data // The identification
		of reproducible biological patterns from high-dimensional omics
		data is a key factor in understanding the biology of complex
		disease or traits. Incorporating prior biological knowledge
		into machine learning is an important step in advancing such
		research. We have proposed a biologically informed multi-stage
		machine learing framework termed BioMM specifically for
		phenotype prediction based on omics-scale data where we can
		evaluate different machine learning models with various prior
		biological meta information.
