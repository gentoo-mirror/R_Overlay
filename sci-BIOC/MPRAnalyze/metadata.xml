		Statistical Analysis of MPRA data // MPRAnalyze provides
		statistical framework for the analysis of data generated by
		Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs), used to directly
		measure enhancer activity. MPRAnalyze can be used for
		quantification of enhancer activity, classification of active
		enhancers and comparative analyses of enhancer activity between
		conditions. MPRAnalyze construct a nested pair of generalized
		linear models (GLMs) to relate the DNA and RNA observations,
		easily adjustable to various experimental designs and
		conditions, and provides a set of rigorous statistical testig
		schemes.
