		Summary Statistics-Based Multivariate Meta-Analysis of Genome-
		Wide Association Studies Using Canonical Correlation Analysis
		// metaCCA performs multivariate analysis of a single or
		multiple GWAS based on univariate regression coefficients. It
		allows multivariate representation of both phenotype and
		genotype. metaCCA extends the statistical technique of
		canonical correlation analysis to the setting where original
		individual-level records are not available, and employs a
		covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness.
