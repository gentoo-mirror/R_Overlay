		DEXUS - Identifying Differential Expression in RNA-Seq Studies
		with Unknown Conditions or without Replicates // DEXUS
		identifies differentially expressed genes in RNA-Seq data under
		all possible study designs such as studies without replicates,
		without sample groups, and with unknown conditions. DEXUS works
		also for known conditions, for example for RNA-Seq data with
		two or multiple conditions. RNA-Seq read count data can be
		provided both by the S4 class Count Data Set and by read count
		matrices. Differentially expressed transcripts can be
		visualized by heatmaps, in which unknown conditions,
		replicates, and samples groups are also indicated. This
		software is fast since the core algorithm is written in C. For
		very large data sets, a parallel version of DEXUS is provided
		in this package. DEXUS is a statistical model that is selected
		in a Bayesian framework by an EM algorithm. DEXUS does not need
		replicates to detect differentially expressed transcripts,
		since the replicates (or conditions) are estimated by the EM
		method for each transcript. The method provides an
		informative/non-informative value to extract differentially
		expressed transcripts at a desired significance level or power.
