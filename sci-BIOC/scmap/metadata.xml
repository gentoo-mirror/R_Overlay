		A tool for unsupervised projection of single cell RNA-seq data //
		Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is widely used to investigate
		the composition of complex tissues since the technology allows
		researchers to define cell-types using unsupervised clustering
		of the transcriptome. However, due to differences in
		experimental methods and computational analyses, it is often
		challenging to directly compare the cells identified in two
		different experiments. scmap is a method for projecting cells
		from a scRNA-seq experiment on to the cell-types or individual
		cells identified in a different experiment.
