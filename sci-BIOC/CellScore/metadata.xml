		Tool for Evaluation of Cell Identity from Transcription Profiles
		// The CellScore package contains functions to evaluate the
		cell identity of a test sample, given a cell transition defined
		with a starting (donor) cell type and a desired target cell
		type. The evaluation is based upon a scoring system, which uses
		a set of standard samples of known cell types, as the reference
		set. The functions have been carried out on a large set of
		microarray data from one platform (Affymetrix Human Genome U133
		Plus 2.0). In principle, the method could be applied to any
		expression dataset, provided that there are a sufficient number
		of standard samples and that the data are normalized.
