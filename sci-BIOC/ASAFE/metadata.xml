		Ancestry Specific Allele Frequency Estimation // Given admixed
		individuals' bi-allelic SNP genotypes and ancestry pairs (where
		each ancestry can take one of three values) for multiple SNPs,
		perform an EM algorithm to deal with the fact that SNP
		genotypes are unphased with respect to ancestry pairs, in order
		to estimate ancestry-specific allele frequencies for all SNPs.
