		Design of target-specific guide RNAs in CRISPR-Cas9, genome-
		editing systems // The package includes functions to find
		potential guide RNAs for input target sequences, optionally
		filter guide RNAs without restriction enzyme cut site, or
		without paired guide RNAs, genome-wide search for off-targets,
		score, rank, fetch flank sequence and indicate whether the
		target and off-targets are located in exon region or not.
		Potential guide RNAs are annotated with total score of the top5
		and topN off-targets, detailed topN mismatch sites, restriction
		enzyme cut sites, and paired guide RNAs. This package leverages
		Biostrings and BSgenome packages.
