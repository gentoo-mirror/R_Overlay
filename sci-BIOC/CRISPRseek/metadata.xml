		Design of target-specific guide RNAs in CRISPR-Cas9, genome-
		editing systems // The package includes functions to find
		potential guide RNAs for input target sequences, optionally
		filter guide RNAs without restriction enzyme cut site, or
		without paired guide RNAs, genome-wide search for off-targets,
		score, rank, fetch flank sequence and indicate whether the
		target and off-targets are located in exon region or not.
		Potential guide RNAs are annotated with total score of the top5
		and topN off-targets, detailed topN mismatch sites, restriction
		enzyme cut sites, and paired guide RNAs. If GeneRfold and GeneR
		are installed (http://bioconductor.case.edu/bioconductor/2.8/bi
		oc/html/GeneRfold.html,
		http://bioc.ism.ac.jp/packages/2.8/bioc/html/GeneR.html), then
		the minimum free energy and bracket notation of secondary
		structure of gRNA and gRNA backbone constant region will be
		included in the summary file. This package leverages Biostrings
		and BSgenome packages.
