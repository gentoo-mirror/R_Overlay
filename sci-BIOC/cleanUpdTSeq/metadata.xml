		This package classifies putative polyadenylation sites as true or
		false/internally oligodT primed // This package implements a
		Naive Bayes classifier for accurate identification of
		polyadenylation sites (pA sites) from oligodT based 3 prime end
		sequencing such as PAS-Seq, PolyA-Seq and RNA-Seq. The
		classifer is highly accurate and outperforms heuristic methods.
