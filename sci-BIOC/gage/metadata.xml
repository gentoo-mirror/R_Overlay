		Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment for Pathway Analysis //
		GAGE is a published method for gene set (enrichment or GSEA) or
		pathway analysis. GAGE is generally applicable independent of
		microarray or RNA-Seq data attributes including sample sizes,
		experimental designs, assay platforms, and other types of
		heterogeneity, and consistently achieves superior performance
		over other frequently used methods. In gage package, we provide
		functions for basic GAGE analysis, result processing and
		presentation. We have also built pipeline routines for of
		multiple GAGE analyses in a batch, comparison between parallel
		analyses, and combined analysis of heterogeneous data from
		different sources/studies. In addition, we provide demo
		microarray data and commonly used gene set data based on KEGG
		pathways and GO terms. These funtions and data are also useful
		for gene set analysis using other methods.
