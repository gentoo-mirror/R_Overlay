		Binomial test for Hi-C data analysis // This is a Hi-C analysis
		package using a cumulative binomial test to detect interactions
		between distal genomic loci that have significantly more reads
		than expected by chance in Hi-C experiments. It takes mapped
		paired NGS reads as input and gives back the list of
		significant interactions for a given bin size in the genome.
