		ChIPseeker for ChIP peak Annotation, Comparison, and
		Visualization // This package implements functions to retrieve
		the nearest genes around the peak, annotate genomic region of
		the peak, statstical methods for estimate the significance of
		overlap among ChIP peak data sets, and incorporate GEO database
		for user to compare the own dataset with those deposited in
		database. The comparison can be used to infer cooperative
		regulation and thus can be used to generate hypotheses. Several
		visualization functions are implemented to summarize the
		coverage of the peak experiment, average profile and heatmap of
		peaks binding to TSS regions, genomic annotation, distance to
		TSS, and overlap of peaks or genes.
