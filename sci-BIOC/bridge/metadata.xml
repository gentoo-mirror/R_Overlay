		Bayesian Robust Inference for Differential Gene Expression //
		Test for differentially expressed genes with microarray data.
		This package can be used with both cDNA microarrays or
		Affymetrix chip. The packge fits a robust Bayesian hierarchical
		model for testing for differential expression. Outliers are
		modeled explicitly using a $t$-distribution. The model includes
		an exchangeable prior for the variances which allow different
		variances for the genes but still shrink extreme empirical
		variances. Our model can be used for testing for differentially
		expressed genes among multiple samples, and can distinguish
		between the different possible patterns of differential
		expression when there are three or more samples. Parameter
		estimation is carried out using a novel version of Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo that is appropriate when the model puts mass on
		subspaces of the full parameter space.
