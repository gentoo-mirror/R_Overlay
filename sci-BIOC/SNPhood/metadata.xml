		SNPhood: Investigate, quantify and visualise the epigenomic
		neighbourhood of SNPs using NGS data // To date, thousands of
		single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be
		associated with complex traits and diseases. However, the vast
		majority of these disease-associated SNPs lie in the non-coding
		part of the genome, and are likely to affect regulatory
		elements, such as enhancers and promoters, rather than function
		of a protein. Thus, to understand the molecular mechanisms
		underlying genetic traits and diseases, it becomes increasingly
		important to study the effect of a SNP on nearby molecular
		traits such as chromatin environment or transcription factor
		(TF) binding. Towards this aim, we developed SNPhood, a user-
		friendly *Bioconductor* R package to investigate and visualize
		the local neighborhood of a set of SNPs of interest for NGS
		data such as chromatin marks or transcription factor binding
		sites from ChIP-Seq or RNA- Seq experiments. SNPhood comprises
		a set of easy-to-use functions to extract, normalize and
		summarize reads for a genomic region, perform various data
		quality checks, normalize read counts using additional input
		files, and to cluster and visualize the regions according to
		the binding pattern. The regions around each SNP can be binned
		in a user-defined fashion to allow for analysis of very broad
		patterns as well as a detailed investigation of specific
		binding shapes. Furthermore, SNPhood supports the integration
		with genotype information to investigate and visualize
		genotype-specific binding patterns. Finally, SNPhood can be
		employed for determining, investigating, and visualizing
		allele-specific binding patterns around the SNPs of interest.
