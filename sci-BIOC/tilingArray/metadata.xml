		Transcript mapping with high-density oligonucleotide tiling
		arrays // The package provides functionality that can be useful
		for the analysis of high-density tiling microarray data (such
		as from Affymetrix genechips) for measuring transcript
		abundance and architecture. The main functionalities of the
		package are: 1. the class 'segmentation' for representing
		partitionings of a linear series of data; 2. the function
		'segment' for fitting piecewise constant models using a dynamic
		programming algorithm that is both fast and exact; 3. the
		function 'confint' for calculating confidence intervals using
		the strucchange package; 4. the function 'plotAlongChrom' for
		generating pretty plots; 5. the function 'normalizeByReference'
		for probe-sequence dependent response adjustment from a (set
		of) reference hybridizations.
