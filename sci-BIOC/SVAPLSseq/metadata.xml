		SVAPLSseq-An R package to estimate the hidden factors of unwanted
		variability and adjust for them to enable a more powerful and
		accurate differential expression analysis based on RNAseq data
		// The package contains functions that are intended for
		extracting the signatures of latent variation in RNAseq data
		and using them to perform an improved differential expression
		analysis for a set of features (genes, transcripts) between two
		specified biological groups.
