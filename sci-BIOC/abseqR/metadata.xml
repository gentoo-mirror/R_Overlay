		Reporting and data analysis functionalities for Rep-Seq datasets
		of antibody libraries // AbSeq is a comprehensive bioinformatic
		pipeline for the analysis of sequencing datasets generated from
		antibody libraries and abseqR is one of its packages. abseqR
		empowers the users of abseqPy
		(https://github.com/malhamdoosh/abseqPy) with plotting and
		reporting capabilities and allows them to generate interactive
		HTML reports for the convenience of viewing and sharing with
		other researchers. Additionally, abseqR extends abseqPy to
		compare multiple repertoire analyses and perform further
		downstream analysis on its output.
