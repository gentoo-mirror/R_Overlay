		Bayesian Modeling of ChIP-chip Data Through Hidden Ising Models
		// Hidden Ising models are implemented to identify enriched
		genomic regions in ChIP-chip data.  They can be used to analyze
		the data from multiple platforms (e.g., Affymetrix, Agilent,
		and NimbleGen), and the data with single to multiple
		replicates.
