		Human genome partitioning of dense sequencing data by identifying
		haplotype blocks // we provide a new SNP sequence partitioning
		method which partitions the whole SNP sequence based on not
		only LD block structures but also gene location information.
		The LD block construction for GPART is performed using Big-LD
		algorithm, with additional improvement from previous version
		reported in Kim et al.(2017). We also add a visualization tool
		to show the LD heatmap with the information of LD block
		boundaries and gene locations in the package.
