		An R package for prediction of nucleosome positions // nuCpos, a
		derivative of NuPoP, is an R package for prediction of
		nucleosome positions. In nuCpos, a duration hidden Markov model
		is trained with a chemical map of nucleosomes either from
		budding yeast, fission yeast, or mouse embryonic stem cells.
		nuCpos outputs the Viterbi (most probable) path of nucleosome-
		linker states, predicted nucleosome occupancy scores and
		histone binding affinity (HBA) scores as NuPoP does. nuCpos can
		also calculate local and whole nucleosomal HBA scores for a
		given 147-bp sequence. Furthermore, effect of genetic
		alterations on nucleosome occupancy can be predicted with this
		package. The parental package NuPoP, which is based on an
		MNase-seq-based map of budding yeast nucleosomes, was developed
		by Ji-Ping Wang and Liqun Xi, licensed under GPL-2.
