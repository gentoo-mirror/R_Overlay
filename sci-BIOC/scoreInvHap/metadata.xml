		Get inversion status in predefined regions // scoreInvHap can get
		the samples' inversion status of known inversions. scoreInvHap
		uses SNP data as input and requires the following information
		about the inversion: genotype frequencies in the different
		haplotypes, R2 between the region SNPs and inversion status and
		heterozygote genotypes in the reference. The package include
		this data for two well known inversions (8p23 and 17q21.31) and
		for two additional regions.
