		Pipeline framework for bioinformatics in R // pipeFrame is an R
		package for building a componentized bioinformatics pipeline.
		Each step in this pipeline is wrapped in the framework, so the
		connection among steps is created seamlessly and automatically.
		Users could focus more on fine-tuning arguments rather than
		spending a lot of time on transforming file format, passing
		task outputs to task inputs or installing the dependencies.
		Componentized step elements can be customized into other new
		pipelines flexibly as well. This pipeline can be split into
		several important functional steps, so it is much easier for
		users to understand the complex arguments from each step rather
		than parameter combination from the whole pipeline. At the same
		time, componentized pipeline can restart at the breakpoint and
		avoid rerunning the whole pipeline, which may save a lot of
		time for users on pipeline tuning or such issues as power off
		or process other interrupts.
