		BANDITS: Bayesian ANalysis of DIfferenTial Splicing // BANDITS is
		a Bayesian hierarchical model for detecting differential
		splicing of genes and transcripts, via differential transcript
		usage (DTU), between two or more conditions. The method uses a
		Bayesian hierarchical framework, which allows for sample
		specific proportions in a Dirichlet-Multinomial model, and
		samples the allocation of fragments to the transcripts.
		Parameters are inferred via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		techniques and a DTU test is performed via a multivariate Wald
		test on the posterior densities for the average relative
		abundance of transcripts.
