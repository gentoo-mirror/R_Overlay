		MicroArray Gene-expression-based Program In Error rate estimation
		// Microarray Classification is designed for both biologists
		and statisticians. It offers the ability to train a classifier
		on a labelled microarray dataset and to then use that
		classifier to predict the class of new observations. A range of
		modern classifiers are available, including support vector
		machines (SVMs), nearest shrunken centroids (NSCs)... Advanced
		methods are provided to estimate the predictive error rate and
		to report the  subset of genes which appear essential in
		discriminating between classes.
