		GWAS Analysis of Regulatory or Functional Information Enrichment
		with LD correction // GARFIELD is a non-parametric functional
		enrichment analysis approach described in the paper GARFIELD:
		GWAS analysis of regulatory or functional information
		enrichment with LD correction. Briefly, it is a method that
		leverages GWAS findings with regulatory or functional
		annotations (primarily from ENCODE and Roadmap epigenomics
		data) to find features relevant to a phenotype of interest. It
		performs greedy pruning of GWAS SNPs (LD r2  0.1) and then
		annotates them based on functional information overlap. Next,
		it quantifies Fold Enrichment (FE) at various GWAS significance
		cutoffs and assesses them by permutation testing, while
		matching for minor allele frequency, distance to nearest
		transcription start site and number of LD proxies (r2  0.8).
