		A statistical normalization method and differential expression
		analysis for RNA-seq data between different species // This
		package provides a scale based normalization (SCBN) method to
		identify genes with differential expression between different
		species. It takes into account the available knowledge of
		conserved orthologous genes and the hypothesis testing
		framework to detect differentially expressed orthologous genes.
		The method on this package are described in the article 'A
		statistical normalization method and differential expression
		analysis for RNA-seq data between different species' by Yan
		Zhou, Jiadi Zhu, Tiejun Tong, Junhui Wang, Bingqing Lin, Jun
		Zhang (2018, pending publication).
