		Patient Clonal Timescapes // TimeScape is an automated tool for
		navigating temporal clonal evolution data. The key attributes
		of this implementation involve the enumeration of clones, their
		evolutionary relationships and their shifting dynamics over
		time. TimeScape requires two inputs: (i) the clonal phylogeny
		and (ii) the clonal prevalences. Optionally, TimeScape accepts
		a data table of targeted mutations observed in each clone and
		their allele prevalences over time. The output is the TimeScape
		plot showing clonal prevalence vertically, time horizontally,
		and the plot height optionally encoding tumour volume during
		tumour-shrinking events. At each sampling time point (denoted
		by a faint white line), the height of each clone accurately
		reflects its proportionate prevalence. These prevalences form
		the anchors for bezier curves that visually represent the
		dynamic transitions between time points.
