		scMerge: Merging multiple batches of scRNA-seq data // Like all
		gene expression data, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data
		suffers from batch effects and other unwanted variations that
		makes accurate biological interpretations difficult. The
		scMerge method leverages factor analysis, stably expressed
		genes (SEGs) and (pseudo-) replicates to remove unwanted
		variations and merge multiple scRNA-Seq data. This package
		contains all the necessary functions in the scMerge pipeline,
		including the identification of SEGs, replication-
		identification methods, and merging of scRNA-Seq data.
