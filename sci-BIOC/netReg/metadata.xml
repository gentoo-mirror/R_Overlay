		Network-Regularized Regression Models // netReg fits linear
		regression models using network-penalization. Graph prior
		knowledge, in the form of biological networks, is being
		incorporated into the loss function of the linear model. The
		networks describe biological relationships such as co-
		regulation or dependency of the same transcription
		factors/metabolites/etc. yielding a part sparse and part smooth
		solution for coefficient profiles.
