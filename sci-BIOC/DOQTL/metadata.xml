		Genotyping and QTL Mapping in DO Mice // DOQTL is a quantitative
		trait locus (QTL) mapping pipeline designed for Diversity
		Outbred mice and other multi-parent outbred populations. The
		package reads in data from genotyping arrays and perform
		haplotype reconstruction using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The
		haplotype probabilities from the HMM are then used to perform
		linkage mapping. When founder sequences are available, DOQTL
		can use the haplotype reconstructions to impute the founder
		sequences onto DO genomes and perform association mapping.
