		Parallel Computing Toolset for Relatedness and Principal
		Component Analysis of SNP Data // Genome-wide association
		studies (GWAS) are widely used to investigate the genetic basis
		of diseases and traits, but they pose many computational
		challenges. We developed an R package SNPRelate to provide a
		binary format for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in
		GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data
		files. The GDS format offers the efficient operations
		specifically designed for integers with two bits, since a SNP
		could occupy only two bits. SNPRelate is also designed to
		accelerate two key computations on SNP data using parallel
		computing for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer
		architectures: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
		relatedness analysis using Identity-By-Descent measures. The
		SNP GDS format is also used by the GWASTools package with the
		support of S4 classes and generic functions. The extended GDS
		format is implemented in the SeqArray package to support the
		storage of single nucleotide variations (SNVs),
		insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) and structural
		variation calls.
