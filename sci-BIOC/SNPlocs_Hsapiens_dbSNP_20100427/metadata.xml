		SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP BUILD 131) // SNP locations
		and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from dbSNP BUILD
		131:human_9606 (based on GRCh37). The source data files used
		for this package were created by NCBI on 24-26 March 2010.
		WARNING: The SNPs in this package are based on the GRCh37
		genome. Note that the GRCh37 genome is the same as the hg19
		genome from UCSC except for the mitochondrion chromosome.
		Therefore, the SNPs in this package can be "injected" in
		BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 but this injection will exclude
		chrM (i.e. nothing will be injected in that sequence).
