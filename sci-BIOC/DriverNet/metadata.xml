		Drivernet: uncovering somatic driver mutations modulating
		transcriptional networks in cancer // DriverNet is a package to
		predict functional important driver genes in cancer by
		integrating genome data (mutation and copy number variation
		data) and transcriptome data (gene expression data). The
		different kinds of data are combined by an influence graph,
		which is a gene-gene interaction network deduced from pathway
		data. A greedy algorithm is used to find the possible driver
		genes, which may mutated in a larger number of patients and
		these mutations will push the gene expression values of the
		connected genes to some extreme values.
