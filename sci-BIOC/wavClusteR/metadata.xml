		Sensitive and highly resolved identification of RNA-protein
		interaction sites in PAR-CLIP data // The package provides an
		integrated pipeline for the analysis of PAR-CLIP data. PAR-
		CLIP-induced transitions are first discriminated from
		sequencing errors, SNPs and additional non-experimental sources
		by a non- parametric mixture model. The protein binding sites
		(clusters) are then resolved at high resolution and cluster
		statistics are estimated using a rigorous Bayesian framework.
		Post-processing of the results, data export for UCSC genome
		browser visualization and motif search analysis are provided.
		In addition, the package allows to integrate RNA-Seq data to
		estimate the False Discovery Rate of cluster detection. Key
		functions support parallel multicore computing. Note: while
		wavClusteR was designed for PAR-CLIP data analysis, it can be
		applied to the analysis of other NGS data obtained from
		experimental procedures that induce nucleotide substitutions
		(e.g. BisSeq).
