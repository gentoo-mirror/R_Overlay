		Affymetrix Spike-in Langmuir Isotherm Data Analysis Tool //
		SpikeLI  is a package that performs the analysis of the
		Affymetrix spike-in data using the Langmuir Isotherm. The aim
		of this package is to show the advantages of a physical-
		chemistry based analysis of the Affymetrix microarray data
		compared to the traditional methods. The spike-in (or Latin
		square) data for the HGU95 and HGU133 chipsets have been
		downloaded from the Affymetrix web site. The model used in the
		spikeLI package is described in details in E. Carlon and T.
		Heim, Physica A 362, 433 (2006).
