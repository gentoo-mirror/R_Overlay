		Package Dependency Tools // This package provides tools for
		computing and analyzing dependency relationships among R
		packages.  It provides tools for building a graph-based
		representation of the dependencies among all packages in a list
		of CRAN-style package repositories.  There are also utilities
		for computing installation order of a given package.  If the
		RCurl package is available, an estimate of the download size
		required to install a given package and its dependencies can be
		obtained.
