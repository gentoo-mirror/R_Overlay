		A Tool for Optimizing Combinations of DNA Barcodes Used in
		Multiplexed Experiments on Next Generation Sequencing Platforms
		// The package allows one to obtain optimised combinations of
		DNA barcodes to be used for multiplex sequencing. In each
		barcode combination, barcodes are pooled with respect to
		Illumina chemistry constraints. Combinations can be filtered to
		keep those that are robust against substitution and
		insertion/deletion errors thereby facilitating the
		demultiplexing step. In addition, the package provides an
		optimiser function to further favor the selection of barcode
		combinations with least heterogeneity in barcode usage.
