		A search tool for single cell RNA-seq data by gene lists //
		Recently a very large collection of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-
		seq) datasets has been generated and publicly released. For the
		collection to be useful, the information must be organized in a
		way that supports queries that are relevant to researchers.
		`scfind` builds an index from scRNA-seq datasets which
		organizes the information in a suitable and compact manner so
		that the datasets can be very efficiently searched for either
		cells or cell types in which a given list of genes is
		expressed.
