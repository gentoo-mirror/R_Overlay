		R package for analysing TFBSs in DNA sequences // 'motifcounter'
		provides motif matching, motif counting and motif enrichment
		functionality based on position frequency matrices. The main
		features of the packages include the utilization of higher-
		order background models and accounting for self-overlapping
		motif matches when determining motif enrichment. The background
		model allows to capture dinucleotide (or higher-order
		nucleotide) composition adequately which may reduced model
		biases and misleading results compared to using simple GC
		background models. When conducting a motif enrichment analysis
		based on the motif match count, the package relies on a
		compound Poisson distribution or alternatively a combinatorial
		model. These distribution account for self-overlapping motif
		structures as exemplified by repeat-like or palindromic motifs,
		and allow to determine the p-value and fold-enrichment for a
		set of observed motif matches.
