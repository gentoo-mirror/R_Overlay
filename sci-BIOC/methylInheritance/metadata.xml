		Permutation-Based Analysis associating Conserved Differentially
		Methylated Elements Across Multiple Generations to a Treatment
		Effect // Permutation analysis, based on Monte Carlo sampling,
		for testing the hypothesis that the number of conserved
		differentially methylated elements, between several
		generations, is associated to an effect inherited from a
		treatment and that stochastic effect can be dismissed.
