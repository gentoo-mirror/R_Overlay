		Determining Epigenetic Heterogeneity from Bisulfite Sequencing
		Data // epihet is an R-package that calculates the epigenetic
		heterogeneity between cancer cells and/or normal cells. The
		functions establish a pipeline that take in bisulfite
		sequencing data from multiple samples and use the data to track
		similarities and differences in epipolymorphism,proportion of
		discordantly methylated sequencing reads (PDR),and Shannon
		entropy values at epialleles that are shared between the
		samples.epihet can be used to perform analysis on the data by
		creating pheatmaps, box plots, PCA plots, and t-SNE plots. MA
		plots can also be created by calculating the differential
		heterogeneity of the samples. And we construct co-epihet
		network and perform network analysis.
