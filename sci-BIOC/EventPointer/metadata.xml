		An effective identification of alternative splicing events using
		junction arrays and RNA-Seq data // EventPointer is an R
		package to identify alternative splicing events that involve
		either simple (case-control experiment) or complex experimental
		designs such as time course experiments and studies including
		paired-samples. The algorithm can be used to analyze data from
		either junction arrays (Affymetrix Arrays) or sequencing data
		(RNA-Seq). The software returns a data.frame with the detected
		alternative splicing events: gene name, type of event
		(cassette, alternative 3',...,etc), genomic position,
		statistical significance and increment of the percent spliced
		in (Delta PSI) for all the events. The algorithm can generate a
		series of files to visualize the detected alternative splicing
		events in IGV. This eases the interpretation of results and the
		design of primers for standard PCR validation.
