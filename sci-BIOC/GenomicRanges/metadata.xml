		Representation and manipulation of genomic intervals // The
		ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic
		annotations and alignments is playing a central role when it
		comes to analyzing high-throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS
		data). The GenomicRanges package defines general purpose
		containers for storing and manipulating genomic intervals and
		variables defined along a genome. More specialized containers
		for representing and manipulating short alignments against a
		reference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an
		experiment, are defined in the GenomicAlignments and
		SummarizedExperiment packages, respectively. Both packages
		build on top of the GenomicRanges infrastructure.
