		Representation and manipulation of genomic intervals and
		variables defined along a genome // The ability to efficiently
		represent and manipulate genomic annotations and alignments is
		playing a central role when it comes to analyzing high-
		throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The GenomicRanges
		package defines general purpose containers for storing and
		manipulating genomic intervals and variables defined along a
		genome. More specialized containers for representing and
		manipulating short alignments against a reference genome, or a
		matrix-like summarization of an experiment, are defined in the
		GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages
		respectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges
		infrastructure.
