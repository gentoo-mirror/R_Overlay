		BaalChIP: Bayesian analysis of allele-specific transcription
		factor binding in cancer genomes // The package offers
		functions to process multiple ChIP-seq BAM files and detect
		allele-specific events. Computes allele counts at individual
		variants (SNPs/SNVs), implements extensive QC steps to remove
		problematic variants, and utilizes a bayesian framework to
		identify statistically significant allele- specific events.
		BaalChIP is able to account for copy number differences between
		the two alleles, a known phenotypical feature of cancer
		samples.
