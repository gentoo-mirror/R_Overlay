		Tools for the preprocessing and analysis of the Illumina
		microarrays on the detector (bead) level // Package blima
		includes several algorithms for the preprocessing of Illumina
		microarray data. It focuses to the bead level analysis and
		provides novel approach to the quantile normalization of the
		vectors of unequal lengths. It provides variety of the methods
		for background correction including background subtraction, RMA
		like convolution and background outlier removal. It also
		implements variance stabilizing transformation on the bead
		level. There are also implemented methods for data
		summarization. It also provides the methods for performing
		T-tests on the detector (bead) level and on the probe level for
		differential expression testing.
