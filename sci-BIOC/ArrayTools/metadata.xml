		geneChip Analysis Package // This package is designed to provide
		solutions for quality assessment and to detect differentially
		expressed genes for the Affymetrix GeneChips, including both 3'
		-arrays and gene 1.0-ST arrays. The package generates
		comprehensive analysis reports in HTML format. Hyperlinks on
		the report page will lead to a series of QC plots, processed
		data, and differentially expressed gene lists. Differentially
		expressed genes are reported in tabular format with annotations
		hyperlinked to online biological databases.
