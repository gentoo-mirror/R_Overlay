		Scale4C: an R/Bioconductor package for scale-space transformation
		of 4C-seq data // Scale4C is an R/Bioconductor package for
		scale-space transformation and visualization of 4C-seq data.
		The scale-space transformation is a multi-scale visualization
		technique to transform a 2D signal (e.g. 4C-seq reads on a
		genomic interval of choice) into a tesselation in the scale
		space (2D, genomic position x scale factor) by applying
		different smoothing kernels (Gauss, with increasing sigma).
		This transformation allows for explorative analysis and
		comparisons of the data's structure with other samples.
