		supraHex: a supra-hexagonal map for analysing tabular omics data
		// A supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional
		grid seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed
		to train, analyse and visualise a high-dimensional omics input
		data. The supraHex is able to carry out gene clustering/meta-
		clustering and sample correlation, plus intuitive
		visualisations to facilitate exploratory analysis. More
		importantly, it allows for overlaying additional data onto the
		trained map to explore relations between input and additional
		data. So with supraHex, it is also possible to carry out
		multilayer omics data comparisons. Newly added utilities are
		advanced heatmap visualisation and tree-based analysis of
		sample relationships. Uniquely to this package, users can
		ultrafastly understand any tabular omics data, both
		scientifically and artistically, especially in a sample-
		specific fashion but without loss of information on large
		genes.
