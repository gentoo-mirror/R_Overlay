		Independent Hypothesis Weighting // Independent hypothesis
		weighting (IHW) is a multiple testing procedure that increases
		power compared to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg by
		assigning data-driven weights to each hypothesis. The input to
		IHW is a two-column table of p-values and covariates. The
		covariate can be any continuous-valued or categorical variable
		that is thought to be informative on the statistical properties
		of each hypothesis test, while it is independent of the p-value
		under the null hypothesis.
