		Leveraging Genetic Evidence to Prioritise Drug Targets at the
		Gene and Pathway Level // Priority index or Pi is developed as
		a genomic-led target prioritisation system, with the focus on
		leveraging human genetic data to prioritise potential drug
		targets at the gene, pathway and network level. The long term
		goal is to use such information to enhance early-stage target
		validation. Based on evidence of disease association from
		genome-wide association studies (GWAS), this prioritisation
		system is able to generate evidence to support identification
		of the specific modulated genes (seed genes) that are
		responsible for the genetic association signal by utilising
		knowledge of linkage disequilibrium (co-inherited genetic
		variants), distance of associated variants from the gene,
		evidence of independent genetic association with gene
		expression in disease-relevant tissues, cell types and states,
		and evidence of physical interactions between disease-
		associated genetic variants and gene promoters based on genome-
		wide capture HiC-generated promoter interactomes in primary
		blood cell types. Seed genes are scored in an integrative way,
		quantifying the genetic influence. Scored seed genes are
		subsequently used as baits to rank seed genes plus additional
		(non-seed) genes; this is achieved by iteratively exploring the
		global connectivity of a gene interaction network. Genes with
		the highest priority are further used to identify/prioritise
		pathways that are significantly enriched with highly
		prioritised genes. Prioritised genes are also used to identify
		a gene network interconnecting highly prioritised genes and a
		minimal number of less prioritised genes (which act as linkers
		bringing together highly prioritised genes).
