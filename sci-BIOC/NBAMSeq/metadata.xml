		Negative Binomial Additive Model for RNA-Seq Data // High-
		throughput sequencing experiments followed by differential
		expression analysis is a widely used approach to detect genomic
		biomarkers. A fundamental step in differential expression
		analysis is to model the association between gene counts and
		covariates of interest. NBAMSeq a flexible statistical model
		based on the generalized additive model and allows for
		information sharing across genes in variance estimation.
