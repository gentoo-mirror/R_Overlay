		SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 151) // SNP locations
		and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build
		151. The source data files used for this package were created
		by NCBI between February 16-22, 2018, and contain SNPs mapped
		to reference genome GRCh38.p7 (a patched version of GRCh38 that
		doesn't alter chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT). Note that these SNPs
		can be "injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.NCBI.GRCh38 or in
		BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.
