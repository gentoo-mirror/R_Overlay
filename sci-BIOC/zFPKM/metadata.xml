		A suite of functions to facilitate zFPKM transformations //
		Perform the zFPKM transform on RNA-seq FPKM data. This
		algorithm is based on the publication by Hart et al., 2013
		(Pubmed ID 24215113). Reference recommends using zFPKM  -3 to
		select expressed genes. Validated with encode open/closed
		chromosome data. Works well for gene level data using FPKM or
		TPM. Does not appear to calibrate well for transcript level
		data.
