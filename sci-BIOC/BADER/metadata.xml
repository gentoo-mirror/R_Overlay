		Bayesian Analysis of Differential Expression in RNA Sequencing
		Data // For RNA sequencing count data, BADER fits a Bayesian
		hierarchical model. The algorithm returns the posterior
		probability of differential expression for each gene between
		two groups A and B. The joint posterior distribution of the
		variables in the model can be returned in the form of posterior
		samples, which can be used for further down-stream analyses
		such as gene set enrichment.
