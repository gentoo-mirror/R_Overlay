		Engineering Evaluation by Gene Categorization (eegc) // This
		package has been developed to evaluate cellular engineering
		processes for direct differentiation of stem cells or
		conversion (transdifferentiation) of somatic cells to primary
		cells based on high throughput gene expression data screened
		either by DNA microarray or RNA sequencing. The package takes
		gene expression profiles as inputs from three types of samples:
		(i) somatic or stem cells to be (trans)differentiated (input of
		the engineering process), (ii) induced cells to be evaluated
		(output of the engineering process) and (iii) target primary
		cells (reference for the output). The package performs
		differential gene expression analysis for each pair-wise sample
		comparison to identify and evaluate the transcriptional
		differences among the 3 types of samples (input, output,
		reference). The ideal goal is to have induced and primary
		reference cell showing overlapping profiles, both very
		different from the original cells.
