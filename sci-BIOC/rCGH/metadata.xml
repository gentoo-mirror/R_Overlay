		Comprehensive Pipeline for Analyzing and Visualizing Array-Based
		CGH Data // A comprehensive pipeline for analyzing and
		interactively visualizing genomic profiles generated through
		commercial or custom aCGH arrays. As inputs, rCGH supports
		Agilent dual-color Feature Extraction files (.txt), from 44 to
		400K, Affymetrix SNP6.0 and cytoScanHD probeset.txt, cychp.txt,
		and cnchp.txt files exported from ChAS or Affymetrix Power
		Tools. rCGH also supports custom arrays, provided data complies
		with the expected format. This package takes over all the steps
		required for individual genomic profiles analysis, from reading
		files to profiles segmentation and gene annotations. This
		package also provides several visualization functions (static
		or interactive) which facilitate individual profiles
		interpretation. Input files can be in compressed format, e.g.
		.bz2 or .gz.
