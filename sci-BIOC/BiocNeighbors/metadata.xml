		Nearest Neighbor Detection for Bioconductor Packages //
		Implements exact and approximate methods for nearest neighbor
		detection, in a framework that allows them to be easily
		switched within Bioconductor packages or workflows. Exact
		searches can be performed using the k-means for k-nearest
		neighbors algorithm or with vantage point trees. Approximate
		searches can be performed using the Annoy or HNSW libraries.
		Searching on either Euclidean or Manhattan distances is
		supported. Parallelization is achieved for all methods by using
		BiocParallel. Functions are also provided to search for all
		neighbors within a given distance.
