		Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning (SIMLR) //
		Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene
		expression measurement of individual cells, and allow the
		discovery of heterogeneity within cell populations. Measurement
		of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical for the
		identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations.
		However, single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional
		measures of gene expression similarity because of the high
		level of noise, outliers and dropouts. We develop a novel
		similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (Single-cell
		Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning), which learns an
		appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension
		reduction, clustering and visualization.
