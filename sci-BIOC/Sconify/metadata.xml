		A toolkit for performing KNN-based statistics for flow and mass
		cytometry data // This package does k-nearest neighbor based
		statistics and visualizations with flow and mass cytometery
		data. This gives tSNE maps"fold change" functionality and
		provides a data quality metric by assessing manifold overlap
		between fcs files expected to be the same. Other applications
		using this package include imputation, marker redundancy, and
		testing the relative information loss of lower dimension
		embeddings compared to the original manifold.
