		Client to access AnnotationHub resources // This package provides
		a client for the Bioconductor AnnotationHub web resource. The
		AnnotationHub web resource provides a central location where
		genomic files (e.g., VCF, bed, wig) and other resources from
		standard locations (e.g., UCSC, Ensembl) can be discovered. The
		resource includes metadata about each resource, e.g., a textual
		description, tags, and date of modification. The client creates
		and manages a local cache of files retrieved by the user,
		helping with quick and reproducible access.
