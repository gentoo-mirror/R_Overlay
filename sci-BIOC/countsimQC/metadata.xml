		Compare Characteristic Features of Count Data Sets // countsimQC
		provides functionality to create a comprehensive report
		comparing a broad range of characteristics across a collection
		of count matrices. One important use case is the comparison of
		one or more synthetic count matrices to a real count matrix,
		possibly the one underlying the simulations. However, any
		collection of count matrices can be compared.
