		Gene Set Analysis Exploiting Pathway Topology // Implements
		topological gene set analysis using a two-step empirical
		approach. It exploits graph decomposition theory to create a
		junction tree and reconstruct the most relevant signal path. In
		the first step clipper selects significant pathways according
		to statistical tests on the means and the concentration
		matrices of the graphs derived from pathway topologies. Then,
		it "clips" the whole pathway identifying  the signal paths
		having the greatest association with a specific phenotype.
