		Locus overlap analysis for enrichment of genomic ranges //
		Provides functions for testing overlap of sets of genomic
		regions with public and custom region set (genomic ranges)
		databases. This makes it possible to do automated enrichment
		analysis for genomic region sets, thus facilitating
		interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data.
