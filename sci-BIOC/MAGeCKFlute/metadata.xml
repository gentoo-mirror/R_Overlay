		Integrative analysis pipeline for pooled CRISPR functional
		genetic screens // MAGeCKFlute is designed to surporting
		downstream analysis, utilizing the gene summary data provided
		through MAGeCK or MAGeCK-VISPR. Quality control, normalization,
		and screen hit identification for CRISPR screen data are
		performed in pipeline. Identified hits within the pipeline are
		categorized based on experimental design, and are subsequently
		interpreted by functional enrichment analysis.
