		Gene ontology enrichment using FUNC // GOfuncR performs a gene
		ontology enrichment analysis based on the ontology enrichment
		software FUNC. GO-annotations are obtained from OrganismDb or
		OrgDb packages ('Homo.sapiens' by default); the GO-graph is
		included in the package and updated regularly (27-Mar-2019).
		GOfuncR provides the standard candidate vs. background
		enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test, as well as
		three additional tests: (i) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is
		used when genes are ranked, (ii) a binomial test that is used
		when genes are associated with two counts and (iii) a Chi-
		square or Fisher's exact test that is used in cases when genes
		are associated with four counts. To correct for multiple
		testing and interdependency of the tests, family-wise error
		rates are computed based on random permutations of the gene-
		associated variables. GOfuncR also provides tools for exploring
		the ontology graph and the annotations, and options to take
		gene-length or spatial clustering of genes into account. It is
		also possible to provide custom gene coordinates, annotations
		and ontologies.
