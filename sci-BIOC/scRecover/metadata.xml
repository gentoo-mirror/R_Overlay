		scRecover for imputation of single-cell RNA-seq data // scRecover
		is an R package for imputation of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-
		seq) data. It will detect and impute dropout values in a scRNA-
		seq raw read counts matrix while keeping the real zeros
		unchanged, since there are both dropout zeros and real zeros in
		scRNA-seq data. By combination with scImpute, SAVER and MAGIC,
		scRecover not only detects dropout and real zeros at higher
		accuracy, but also improve the downstream clustering and
		visualization results.
