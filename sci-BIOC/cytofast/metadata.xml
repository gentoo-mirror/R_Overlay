		cytofast - A quick visualization and analysis tool for CyTOF data
		// Multi-parametric flow and mass cytometry allows exceptional
		high-resolution exploration of the cellular composition of the
		immune system. Together with tools like FlowSOM and Cytosplore
		it is possible to identify novel cell types. By introducing
		cytofast we hope to offer a workflow for visualization and
		quantification of cell clusters for an efficient discovery of
		cell populations associated with diseases or other clinical
		outcomes.
