		JODA algorithm for quantifying gene deregulation using knowledge
		// Package 'joda' implements three steps of an algorithm called
		JODA. The algorithm computes gene deregulation scores. For each
		gene, its deregulation score reflects how strongly an effect of
		a certain regulator's perturbation on this gene differs between
		two different cell populations. The algorithm utilizes
		regulator knockdown expression data as well as knowledge about
		signaling pathways in which the regulators are involved
		(formalized in a simple matrix model).
