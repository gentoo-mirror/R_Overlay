		Plotting genomic information from Ensembl // Genomic data
		analyses requires integrated visualization of known genomic
		information and new experimental data.  GenomeGraphs uses the
		biomaRt package to perform live annotation queries to Ensembl
		and translates this to e.g. gene/transcript structures in
		viewports of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic
		information plotted together with your data.  Another strength
		of GenomeGraphs is to plot different data types such as array
		CGH, gene expression, sequencing and other data, together in
		one plot using the same genome coordinate system.
