		ExCluster robustly detects differentially expressed exons between
		two conditions of RNA-seq data, requiring at least two
		independent biological replicates per condition // ExCluster
		flattens Ensembl and GENCODE GTF files into GFF files, which
		are used to count reads per non-overlapping exon bin from BAM
		files. This read counting is done using the function
		featureCounts from the package Rsubread. Library sizes are
		normalized across all biological replicates, and ExCluster then
		compares two different conditions to detect signifcantly
		differentially spliced genes. This process requires at least
		two independent biological repliates per condition, and
		ExCluster accepts only exactly two conditions at a time.
		ExCluster ultimately produces false discovery rates (FDRs) per
		gene, which are used to detect significance. Exon log2 fold
		change (log2FC) means and variances may be plotted for each
		significantly differentially spliced gene, which helps
		scientists develop hypothesis and target differential splicing
		events for RT-qPCR validation in the wet lab.
