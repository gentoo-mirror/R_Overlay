		CpG Island Analysis Pipeline for Illumina Methylation Array and
		Targeted BS-Seq Data // COHCAP (pronounced "co-cap") provides a
		pipeline to analyze single-nucleotide resolution methylation
		data (Illumina 450k/EPIC methylation array, targeted BS-Seq,
		etc.). It provides differential methylation for CpG Sites,
		differential methylation for CpG Islands, integration with gene
		expression data, with visualizaton options. Discussion Group:
