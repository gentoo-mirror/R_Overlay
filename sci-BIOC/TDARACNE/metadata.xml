		Network reverse engineering from time course data. // To infer
		gene networks from time-series measurements is a current
		challenge into  bioinformatics research  area. In order to
		detect dependencies between genes at different time delays, we
		propose an  approach  to  infer  gene  regulatory  networks
		from  time-series measurements starting from a well known
		algorithm based on information theory. The proposed algorithm
		is expected to  be useful in reconstruction of small biological
		directed networks from time course data.
