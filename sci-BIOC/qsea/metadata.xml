		IP-seq data analysis and vizualization // qsea (quantitative
		sequencing enrichment analysis) was developed as the successor
		of the MEDIPS package for analyzing data derived from
		methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed
		by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, qsea provides several
		functionalities for the analysis of other kinds of quantitative
		sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others)
		including calculation of differential enrichment between groups
		of samples.
