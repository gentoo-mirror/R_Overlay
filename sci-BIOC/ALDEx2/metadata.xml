		Analysis of differential abundance taking sample variation into
		account // A differential abundance analysis for the comparison
		of two or more conditions. For example, single-organism and
		meta-RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing assays, or of selected
		and unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections. Uses a
		Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts,
		that has been optimized for three or more experimental
		replicates. Infers sampling variation and calculates the
		expected false discovery rate given the biological and sampling
		variation using the Wilcox rank test or Welches t-test
		(aldex.ttest) or the glm and Kruskal Wallis tests (aldex.glm).
		Reports both P and fdr values calculated by the Benjamini
		Hochberg correction.
