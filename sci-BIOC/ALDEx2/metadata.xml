		Analysis Of Differential Abundance Taking Sample Variation Into
		Account // A differential abundance analysis for the comparison
		of two or more conditions. Useful for analyzing data from
		standard RNA-seq or meta-RNA-seq assays as well as selected and
		unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections. Uses a
		Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts,
		optimized for three or more experimental replicates. The method
		infers biological and sampling variation to calculate the
		expected false discovery rate, given the variation, based on a
		Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and Welch's t-test (via aldex.ttest), a
		Kruskal-Wallis test (via aldex.kw), a generalized linear model
		(via aldex.glm), or a correlation test (via aldex.corr). All
		tests report p-values and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected
		p-values.
