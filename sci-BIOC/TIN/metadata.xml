		Transcriptome instability analysis // The TIN package implements
		a set of tools for transcriptome instability analysis based on
		exon expression profiles. Deviating exon usage is studied in
		the context of splicing factors to analyse to what degree
		transcriptome instability is correlated to splicing factor
		expression. In the transcriptome instability correlation
		analysis, the data is compared to both random permutations of
		alternative splicing scores and expression of random gene sets.
