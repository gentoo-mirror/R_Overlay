		Sparse Data Observations for Simulating Synthetic Abundance //
		The package is to provide a model based Bayesian method to
		characterize and simulate microbiome data. sparseDOSSA's model
		captures the marginal distribution of each microbial feature as
		a truncated, zero-inflated log-normal distribution, with
		parameters distributed as a parent log-normal distribution. The
		model can be effectively fit to reference microbial datasets in
		order to parameterize their microbes and communities, or to
		simulate synthetic datasets of similar population structure.
		Most importantly, it allows users to include both known
		feature-feature and feature-metadata correlation structures and
		thus provides a gold standard to enable benchmarking of
		statistical methods for metagenomic data analysis.
