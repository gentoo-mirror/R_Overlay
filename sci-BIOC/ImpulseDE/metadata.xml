		Detection of DE genes in time series data using impulse models //
		ImpulseDE is suited to capture single impulse-like patterns in
		high throughput time series datasets. By fitting a
		representative impulse model to each gene, it reports
		differentially expressed genes whether across time points in a
		single experiment or between two time courses from two
		experiments. To optimize the running time, the code makes use
		of clustering steps and multi-threading.
