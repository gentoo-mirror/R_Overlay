		Science-wise false discovery rate and proportion of true null
		hypotheses estimation // This package allows users to estimate
		the science-wise false discovery rate from Jager and Leek,
		"Empirical estimates suggest most published medical research is
		true," 2013, Biostatistics, using an EM approach due to the
		presence of rounding and censoring. It also allows users to
		estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses in the presence
		of covariates, using a regression framework, as per Boca and
		Leek, "A regression framework for the proportion of true null
		hypotheses," 2015, bioRxiv preprint.
