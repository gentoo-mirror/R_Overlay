		runibic: row-based biclustering algorithm for analysis of gene
		expression data in R // This package implements UbiBic
		algorithm in R. This biclustering algorithm for analysis of
		gene expression data was introduced by Zhenjia Wang et al. in
		2016. It is currently considered the most promising
		biclustering method for identification of meaningful structures
		in complex and noisy data.
