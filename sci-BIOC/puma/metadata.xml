		Propagating Uncertainty in Microarray Analysis(including
		Affymetrix tranditional 3' arrays and exon arrays and Human
		Transcriptome Array 2.0) // Most analyses of Affymetrix
		GeneChip data (including tranditional 3' arrays and exon arrays
		and Human Transcriptome Array 2.0) are based on point estimates
		of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such
		estimates. By propagating uncertainty to downstream analyses we
		can improve results from microarray analyses. For the first
		time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation
		methods available to a general audience. In additon to calculte
		gene expression from Affymetrix 3' arrays, puma also provides
		methods to process exon arrays and produces gene and isoform
		expression for alternative splicing study. puma also offers
		improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over
		previously available uncertainty propagation methods. Included
		are summarisation, differential expression detection,
		clustering and PCA methods, together with useful plotting
		functions.
