		Top Scoring Pairs for Microarray Classification // These
		functions calculate the pair of genes that show the maximum
		difference in ranking between two user specified groups. This
		"top scoring pair" maximizes the average of sensitivity and
		specificity over all rank based classifiers using a pair of
		genes in the data set. The advantage of classifying samples
		based on only the relative rank of a pair of genes is (a) the
		classifiers are much simpler and often more interpretable than
		more complicated classification schemes and (b) if arrays can
		be classified using only a pair of genes, PCR based tests could
		be used for classification of samples. See the references for
		the tspcalc() function for references regarding TSP
		classifiers.
