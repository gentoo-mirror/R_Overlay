		Condition Comparison in scRNA-seq Data // For a given clustered
		data, which can also be split into two conditions, this package
		provides a way to perform a condition comparison on said
		clustered data. The comparison is performed on each cluster.
		Several statistics are used and, when analysed in conjunction,
		they might give some insight regarding the heterogeneity of
		some of the clusters.
