		R-based analysis of ChIP-seq And Differential Expression - a tool
		for integrating a count-based ChIP-seq analysis with
		differential expression summary data. // Rcade (which stands
		for "R-based analysis of ChIP-seq And Differential Expression")
		is a tool for integrating ChIP-seq data with differential
		expression summary data, through a Bayesian framework. A key
		application is in identifing the genes targeted by a
		transcription factor of interest - that is, we collect genes
		that are associated with a ChIP-seq peak, and differential
		expression under some perturbation related to that TF.
