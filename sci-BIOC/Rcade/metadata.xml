		R-based analysis of ChIP-seq And Differential Expression - a tool
		for integrating a count-based ChIP-seq analysis with
		differential expression summary data // Rcade (which stands for
		"R-based analysis of ChIP-seq And Differential Expression") is
		a tool for integrating ChIP-seq data with differential
		expression summary data, through a Bayesian framework. A key
		application is in identifing the genes targeted by a
		transcription factor of interest - that is, we collect genes
		that are associated with a ChIP-seq peak, and differential
		expression under some perturbation related to that TF.
