		Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology //
		Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology (DART)
		is an algorithm designed to evaluate the consistency of prior
		information molecular signatures (e.g in-vitro perturbation
		expression signatures) in independent molecular data (e.g gene
		expression data sets). If consistent, a pruning network
		strategy is then used to infer the activation status of the
		molecular signature in individual samples.
