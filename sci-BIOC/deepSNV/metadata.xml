		Detection of subclonal SNVs in deep sequencing data. // This
		package provides provides quantitative variant callers for
		detecting subclonal mutations in ultra-deep (=100x coverage)
		sequencing experiments. The deepSNV algorithm is used for a
		comparative setup with a control experiment of the same loci
		and uses a beta-binomial model and a likelihood ratio test to
		discriminate sequencing errors and subclonal SNVs. The
		shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes classifier based on a
		beta-binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples
		for precisely estimating model parameters - such as local error
		rates and dispersion - and prior knowledge, e.g. from variation
		data bases such as COSMIC.
