		Detection of subclonal SNVs in deep sequencing data. // This
		package provides provides quantitative variant callers for
		detecting subclonal mutations in ultra-deep (=100x coverage)
		sequencing experiments. The deepSNV algorithm is used for a
		comparative setup with a control experiment of the same loci
		and uses a beta-binomial model and a likelihood ratio test to
		discriminate sequencing errors and subclonal SNVs. The
		shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes classifier based on a
		beta-binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples
		for precisely estimating model parameters such as local error
		rates and dispersion and prior knowledge, e.g. from variation
		data bases such as COSMIC.
