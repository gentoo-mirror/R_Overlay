		Uses Brown's method to combine p-values from dependent tests //
		Combining P-values from multiple statistical tests is common in
		bioinformatics. However, this procedure is non-trivial for
		dependent P-values. This package implements an empirical
		adaptation of Browns Method (an extension of Fishers Method)
		for combining dependent P-values which is appropriate for
		highly correlated data sets found in high-throughput biological
		experiments.
