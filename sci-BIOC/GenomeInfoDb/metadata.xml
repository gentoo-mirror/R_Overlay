		Utilities for manipulating chromosome and other 'seqname'
		identifiers // Contains data and functions that define and
		allow translation between different chromosome sequence naming
		conventions (e.g., "chr1" versus "1"), including a function
		that attempts to place sequence names in their natural, rather
		than lexicographic, order.
