		Automated Optimization of XCMS Data Processing parameters // The
		outcome of XCMS data processing strongly depends on the
		parameter settings. IPO (`Isotopologue Parameter Optimization`)
		is a parameter optimization tool that is applicable for
		different kinds of samples and liquid chromatography coupled to
		high resolution mass spectrometry devices, fast and free of
		labeling steps. IPO uses natural, stable 13C isotopes to
		calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is
		optimized by minimizing the relative retention time differences
		within features and grouping parameters are optimized by
		maximizing the number of features showing exactly one peak from
		each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter
		settings are achieved by design of experiment. The resulting
		scores are evaluated using response surface models.
