		Implementation of Biostrings to work with nucleotide sequences
		containing modified nucleotides // Representing nucleotide
		modifications in a nucleotide sequence is usually done via
		special characters from a number of sources. This represents a
		challenge to work with in R and the Biostrings package. The
		Modstrings package implements this functionallity for RNA and
		DNA sequences containing modified nucleotides by translating
		the character internally in order to work with the
		infrastructure of the Biostrings package. For this the
		ModRNAString and ModDNAString classes and derivates and
		functions to construct and modify these objects despite the
		encoding issues are implemenented. In addition the conversion
		from sequences to list like location information (and the
		reverse operation) is implemented as well.
