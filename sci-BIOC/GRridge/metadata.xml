		Better prediction by use of co-data: Adaptive group-regularized
		ridge regression // This package allows the use of multiple
		sources of co-data (e.g. external p-values, gene lists,
		annotation) to improve prediction of binary, continuous and
		survival response using (logistic, linear or Cox) group-
		regularized ridge regression. It also facilitates post-hoc
		variable selection and prediction diagnostics by cross-
		validation using ROC curves and AUC.
