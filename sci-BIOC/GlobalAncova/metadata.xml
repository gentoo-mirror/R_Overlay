		Calculates a global test for differential gene expression between
		groups // We give the following arguments in support of the
		GlobalAncova approach: After appropriate normalisation, gene-
		expression-data appear rather symmetrical and outliers are no
		real problem, so least squares should be rather robust. ANCOVA
		with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different
		means per group and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to
		correct for possible selection bias. Variance homogeneity and
		uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application of
		ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal
		estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken). Therefore, using the classical
		F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic
		however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In
		combination with a permutation approach, empirical significance
		levels can be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation
		yields asymptotic p-values. This work was supported by the NGFN
		grant 01 GR 0459, BMBF, Germany.
