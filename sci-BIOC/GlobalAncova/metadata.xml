		Global test for groups of variables via model comparisons // The
		association between a variable of interest (e.g. two groups)
		and the global pattern of a group of variables (e.g. a gene
		set) is tested via a global F-test. We give the following
		arguments in support of the GlobalAncova approach: After
		appropriate normalisation, gene-expression-data appear rather
		symmetrical and outliers are no real problem, so least squares
		should be rather robust. ANCOVA with interaction yields
		saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group and
		gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible
		selection bias. Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals
		cannot be expected. Application of ordinary least squares gives
		unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-
		Aitken). Therefore, using the classical F-test is
		inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic however
		mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination
		with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can
		be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation yields
		asymptotic p-values. The framework is generalized to groups of
		categorical variables or even mixed data by a likelihood ratio
		approach. Closed and hierarchical testing procedures are
		supported. This work was supported by the NGFN grant 01 GR
		0459, BMBF, Germany and BMBF grant 01ZX1309B, Germany.
