		EasyqpcR for low-throughput real-time quantitative PCR data
		analysis // This package is based on the qBase algorithms
		published by Hellemans et al. in 2007. The EasyqpcR package
		allows you to import easily qPCR data files as described in the
		vignette. Thereafter, you can calculate amplification
		efficiencies, relative quantities and their standard errors,
		normalization factors based on the best reference genes choosen
		(using the SLqPCR package), and then the normalized relative
		quantities, the NRQs scaled to your control and their standard
		errors. This package has been created for low-throughput qPCR
		data analysis.
