		Calculate strandness information of a bam file // This package
		aims to quantify and remove putative double strand DNA from a
		strand-specific RNA sample. There are also options and methods
		to plot the positive/negative proportions of all sliding
		windows, which allow users to have an idea of how much the
		sample was contaminated and the appropriate threshold to be
		used for filtering.
