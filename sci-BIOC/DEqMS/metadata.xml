		a tool to perform statistical analysis of differential protein
		expression for quantitative proteomics data. // DEqMS is
		developped on top of Limma. However, Limma assumes same prior
		variance for all genes. In proteomics, the accuracy of protein
		abundance estimates varies by the number of peptides/PSMs
		quantified in both label-free and labelled data. Proteins
		quantification by multiple peptides or PSMs are more accurate.
		DEqMS package is able to estimate different prior variances for
		proteins quantified by different number of PSMs/peptides,
		therefore acchieving better accuracy. The package can be
		applied to analyze both label-free and labelled proteomics
		data.
