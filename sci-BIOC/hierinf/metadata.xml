		Hierarchical Inference // Tools to perform hierarchical inference
		for one or multiple studies / data sets based on high-
		dimensional multivariate (generalised) linear models. A
		possible application is to perform hierarchical inference for
		GWA studies to find significant groups or single SNPs (if the
		signal is strong) in a data-driven and automated procedure. The
		method is based on an efficient hierarchical multiple testing
		correction and controls the FWER. The functions can easily be
		run in parallel.
