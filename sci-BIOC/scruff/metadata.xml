		Single Cell RNA-Seq UMI Filtering Facilitator (scruff) // A
		pipeline which processes single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) reads
		from CEL-seq and CEL-seq2 protocols. Demultiplex scRNA-seq
		FASTQ files, align reads to reference genome using Rsubread,
		and generate UMI filtered count matrix. Also provide
		visualizations of read alignments and pre- and post-alignment
		QC metrics.
