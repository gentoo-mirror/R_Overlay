		Quasispecies Diversity // Set of utility functions for viral
		quasispecies analysis with NGS data. Most functions are equally
		useful for metagenomic studies. There are three main types: (1)
		data manipulation and explorationfunctions useful for
		converting reads to haplotypes and frequencies, repairing
		reads, intersecting strand haplotypes, and visualizing
		haplotype alignments. (2) diversity indicesfunctions to compute
		diversity and entropy, in which incidence, abundance, and
		functional indices are considered. (3) data simulationfunctions
		useful for generating random viral quasispecies data.
