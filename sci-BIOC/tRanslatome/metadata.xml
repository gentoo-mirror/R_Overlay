		Comparison between multiple levels of gene expression //
		Detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the
		comparison of two biological conditions (treated vs. untreated,
		diseased vs. normal, mutant vs. wild-type) among different
		levels of gene expression (transcriptome ,translatome,
		proteome), using several statistical methods:  Rank Product,
		Translational Efficiency, t-test, Limma, ANOTA, DESeq, edgeR.
		Possibility to plot the results with scatterplots, histograms,
		MA plots, standard deviation (SD) plots, coefficient of
		variation (CV) plots. Detection of significantly enriched post-
		transcriptional regulatory factors (RBPs, miRNAs, etc) and Gene
		Ontology terms in the lists of DEGs previously identified for
		the two expression levels. Comparison of GO terms enriched only
		in one of the levels or in both. Calculation of the semantic
		similarity score between the lists of enriched GO terms coming
		from the two expression levels. Visual examination and
		comparison of the enriched terms with heatmaps, radar plots and
		barplots.
