		Comparison between multiple levels of gene expression //
		Detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the
		comparison of two biological conditions (treated vs. untreated,
		diseased vs. normal, mutant vs. wild-type) among different
		levels of gene expression (transcriptome ,translatome,
		proteome), using several statistical methods:  Rank Product,
		Translational Efficiency, t-test, SAM, Limma, ANOTA, DESeq,
		edgeR. Possibility to plot the results with scatterplots,
		histograms, MA plots, standard deviation (SD) plots,
		coefficient of variation (CV) plots. Detection of significantly
		enriched post-transcriptional regulatory factors (RBPs, miRNAs,
		etc) and Gene Ontology terms in the lists of DEGs previously
		identified for the two expression levels. Comparison of GO
		terms enriched only in one of the levels or in both.
		Calculation of the semantic similarity score between the lists
		of enriched GO terms coming from the two expression levels.
		Visual examination and comparison of the enriched terms with
		heatmaps, radar plots and barplots.
