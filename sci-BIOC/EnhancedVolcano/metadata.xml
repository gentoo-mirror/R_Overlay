		Publication-ready volcano plots with enhanced colouring and
		labeling // Volcano plots represent a useful way to visualise
		the results of differential expression analyses. Here, we
		present a highly-configurable function that produces
		publication-ready volcano plots. EnhancedVolcano will attempt
		to fit as many transcript names in the plot window as possible,
		thus avoiding clogging up the plot with labels that could not
		otherwise have been read. Other functionality allows the user
		to identify up to 3 different types of attributes in the same
		plot space via colour, shape, and shade parameter
		configurations.
