		KinSwingR: network-based kinase activity prediction // KinSwingR
		integrates phosphosite data derived from mass-spectrometry data
		and kinase-substrate predictions to predict kinase activity.
		Several functions allow the user to build PWM models of kinase-
		subtrates, statistically infer PWM:substrate matches, and
		integrate these data to infer kinase activity.
