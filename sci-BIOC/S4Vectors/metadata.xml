		Foundation of vector-like and list-like containers in
		Bioconductor // The S4Vectors package defines the Vector and
		List virtual classes and a set of generic functions that extend
		the semantic of ordinary vectors and lists in R. Package
		developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like
		objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition,
		a few low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g.
		DataFrame, Rle, and Hits) are implemented in the S4Vectors
		package itself (many more are implemented in the IRanges
		package and in other Bioconductor infrastructure packages).
