		Shrinkage estimation of dispersion in Negative Binomial models
		for RNA-seq experiments with small sample size // The purpose
		of this package is to discover the genes that are
		differentially expressed between two conditions in RNA-seq
		experiments. Gene expression is measured in counts of
		transcripts and modeled with the Negative Binomial (NB)
		distribution using a shrinkage approach for dispersion
		estimation. The method of moment (MM) estimates for dispersion
		are shrunk towards an estimated target, which minimizes the
		average squared difference between the shrinkage estimates and
		the initial estimates. The exact per-gene probability under the
		NB model is calculated, and used to test the hypothesis that
		the expected expression of a gene in two conditions identically
		follow a NB distribution.
