		GDCRNATools: an R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis
		of lncRNA, mRNA, and miRNA data in GDC // This is an easy-to-
		use package for downloading, organizing, and integrative
		analyzing RNA expression data in GDC with an emphasis on
		deciphering the lncRNA-mRNA related ceRNA regulatory network in
		cancer. Three databases of lncRNA-miRNA interactions including
		spongeScan, starBase, and miRcode, as well as three databases
		of mRNA-miRNA interactions including miRTarBase, starBase, and
		miRcode are incorporated into the package for ceRNAs network
		construction. limma, edgeR, and DESeq2 can be used to identify
		differentially expressed genes/miRNAs. Functional enrichment
		analyses including GO, KEGG, and DO can be performed based on
		the clusterProfiler and DO packages. Both univariate CoxPH and
		KM survival analyses of multiple genes can be implemented in
		the package. Besides some routine visualization functions such
		as volcano plot, bar plot, and KM plot, a few simply shiny apps
		are developed to facilitate visualization of results on a local
		webpage.
