		A compilation of metadata from NCBI GEO // The NCBI Gene
		Expression Omnibus (GEO) represents the largest public
		repository of microarray data. However, finding data of
		interest can be challenging using current tools. GEOmetadb is
		an attempt to make access to the metadata associated with
		samples, platforms, and datasets much more feasible. This is
		accomplished by parsing all the NCBI GEO metadata into a SQLite
		database that can be stored and queried locally. GEOmetadb is
		simply a thin wrapper around the SQLite database along with
		associated documentation. Finally, the SQLite database is
		updated regularly as new data is added to GEO and can be
		downloaded at will for the most up-to-date metadata. GEOmetadb
