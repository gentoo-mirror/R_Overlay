		Multivariate and directional gene set testing // mvGST provides
		platform-independent tools to identify GO terms (gene sets)
		that are differentially active (up or down) in multiple
		contrasts of interest.  Given a matrix of one-sided p-values
		(rows for genes, columns for contrasts), mvGST uses meta-
		analytic methods to combine p-values for all genes annotated to
		each gene set, and then classify each gene set as being
		significantly more active (1), less active (-1), or not
		significantly differentially active (0) in each contrast of
		interest.  With multiple contrasts of interest, each gene set
		is assigned to a profile (across contrasts) of differential
		activity.  Tools are also provided for visualizing (in a GO
		graph) the gene sets classified to a given profile.
