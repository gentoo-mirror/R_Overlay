		(Dynamic) Nested Effects Models and Deterministic Effects
		Propagation Networks to reconstruct phenotypic hierarchies //
		The package 'nem' allows to reconstruct features of pathways
		from the nested structure of perturbation effects. It takes as
		input (1.) a set of pathway components, which were perturbed,
		and (2.) phenotypic readout of these perturbations (e.g. gene
		expression, protein expression). The output is a directed graph
		representing the phenotypic hierarchy.
