		Experimental Design in Differential Abundance analysis // EDDA
		can aid in the design of a range of common experiments such as
		RNA-seq, Nanostring assays, RIP-seq and Metagenomic sequencing,
		and enables researchers to comprehensively investigate the
		impact of experimental decisions on the ability to detect
		differential abundance. This work was published on 3 December
		2014 at Genome Biology under the title "The importance of study
		design for detecting differentially abundant features in high-
		throughput experiments"
		(http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/12/527).
