		Convex Analysis of Mixtures for Tissue Heterogeneity
		Characterization // An R package for tissue heterogeneity
		characterization by convex analysis of mixtures (CAM). It
		provides basic functions to perform unsupervised deconvolution
		on mixture expression profiles by CAM and some auxiliary
		functions to help understand the subpopulation-specific
		results. It also implements functions to perform supervised
		deconvolution based on prior knowledge of molecular markers, S
		matrix or A matrix. Combining molecular markers from CAM and
		from prior knowledge can achieve semi-supervised deconvolution
		of mixtures.
