		Identification of candidate genes associated with genetic
		variation // Identification of the most likely gene or genes
		through which variation at a given genomic locus in the human
		genome acts. The most basic functionality assumes that the
		closer gene is to the input locus, the more likely the gene is
		to be causative. Additionally, any empirical data that links
		genomic regions to genes (e.g. eQTL or genome conformation
		data) can be used if it is supplied in the UCSC .BED file
		format.
