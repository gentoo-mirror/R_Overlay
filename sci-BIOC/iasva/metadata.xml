		Iteratively Adjusted Surrogate Variable Analysis // Iteratively
		Adjusted Surrogate Variable Analysis (IA-SVA) is a statistical
		framework to uncover hidden sources of variation even when
		these sources are correlated. IA-SVA provides a flexible
		methodology to i) identify a hidden factor for unwanted
		heterogeneity while adjusting for all known factors; ii) test
		the significance of the putative hidden factor for explaining
		the unmodeled variation in the data; and iii), if significant,
		use the estimated factor as an additional known factor in the
		next iteration to uncover further hidden factors.
