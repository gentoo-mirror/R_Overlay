		Routines for the functional analysis of biological networks //
		This package provides functions for the integrated analysis of
		protein-protein interaction networks and the detection of
		functional modules. Different datasets can be integrated into
		the network by assigning p-values of statistical tests to the
		nodes of the network. E.g. p-values obtained from the
		differential expression of the genes from an Affymetrix array
		are assigned to the nodes of the network. By fitting a beta-
		uniform mixture model and calculating scores from the p-values,
		overall scores of network regions can be calculated and an
		integer linear programming algorithm identifies the maximum
		scoring subnetwork.
