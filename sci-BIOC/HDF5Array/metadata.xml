		HDF5 backend for DelayedArray objects // Implements the HDF5Array
		and TENxMatrix classes, 2 convenient and memory-efficient
		array-like containers for on-disk representation of HDF5
		datasets. HDF5Array is for datasets that use the conventional
		(i.e. dense) HDF5 representation. TENxMatrix is for datasets
		that use the HDF5-based sparse matrix representation from 10x
		Genomics (e.g. the 1.3 Million Brain Cell Dataset). Both
		containers being DelayedArray extensions, they support all
		operations supported by DelayedArray objects. These operations
		can be either delayed or block-processed.
