		Fast Correlation Based Filter for Feature Selection // This
		package provides a simple R implementation for the Fast
		Correlation Based Filter described in Yu, L. and Liu, H.;
		Feature Selection for High-Dimensional Data: A Fast Correlation
		Based Filter Solution,Proc. 20th Intl. Conf. Mach. Learn.
		(ICML-2003), Washington DC, 2003 The current package is an
		intent to make easier for bioinformaticians to use FCBF for
		feature selection, especially regarding transcriptomic
		data.This implies discretizing expression (function
		discretize_exprs) before calculating the features that explain
		the class, but are not predictable by other features. The
		functions are implemented based on the algorithm of Yu and Liu,
		2003 and Rajarshi Guha's implementation from 13/05/2005
		available (as of 26/08/2018) at
		http://www.rguha.net/code/R/fcbf.R .
