		Collection of functions for reading and comparing SAGE libraries
		// This package implements several functions useful for
		analysis of gene expression data by sequencing tags as done in
		SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expressen) data, i.e. extraction
		of a SAGE library from sequence files, sequence error
		correction, library comparison. Sequencing error correction is
		implementing using an Expectation Maximization Algorithm based
		on a Mixture Model of tag counts.
