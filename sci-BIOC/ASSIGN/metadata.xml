		Adaptive Signature Selection and InteGratioN (ASSIGN) // ASSIGN
		is a computational tool to evaluate the pathway
		deregulation/activation status in individual patient samples.
		ASSIGN employs a flexible Bayesian factor analysis approach
		that adapts predetermined pathway signatures derived either
		from knowledge-based literature or from perturbation
		experiments to the cell-/tissue-specific pathway signatures.
		The deregulation/activation level of each context-specific
		pathway is quantified to a score, which represents the extent
		to which a patient sample encompasses the pathway
		deregulation/activation signature.
