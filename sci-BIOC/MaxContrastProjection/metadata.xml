		Perform a maximum contrast projection of 3D images along the
		z-dimension into 2D // A problem when recording 3D fluorescent
		microscopy images is how to properly present these results in
		2D. Maximum intensity projections are a popular method to
		determine the focal plane of each pixel in the image. The
		problem with this approach, however, is that out-of-focus
		elements will still be visible, making edges and fine
		structures difficult to detect. This package aims to resolve
		this problem by using the contrast around a given pixel to
		determine the focal plane, allowing for a much cleaner
		structure detection than would be otherwise possible. For
		convenience, this package also contains functions to perform
		various other types of projections, including a maximum
		intensity projection.
