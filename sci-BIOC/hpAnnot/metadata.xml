		Anotation package for Hipathia package // Package containing
		example and annotation data for Hipathia package. Hipathia is a
		method for the computation of signal transduction along
		signaling pathways from transcriptomic data. The method is
		based on an iterative algorithm which is able to compute the
		signal intensity passing through the nodes of a network by
		taking into account the level of expression of each gene and
		the intensity of the signal arriving to it. It also provides a
		new approach to functional analysis allowing to compute the
		signal arriving to the functions annotated to each pathway.
		Hipathia depends on this package to be functional.
