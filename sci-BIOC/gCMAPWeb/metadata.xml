		A web interface for gene-set enrichment analyses // The gCMAPWeb
		R package provides a graphical user interface for the gCMAP
		package. gCMAPWeb uses the Rook package and can be used either
		on a local machine, leveraging R's internal web server, or run
		on a dedicated rApache web server installation. gCMAPWeb allows
		users to search their own data sources and instructions to
		generate reference datasets from public repositories are
		included with the package. The package supports three common
		types of analyses, specifically queries with 1. one or two sets
		of query gene identifiers, whose members are expected to show
		changes in gene expression in a consistent direction. For
		example, an up-regulated gene set might contain genes activated
		by a transcription factor, a down-regulated geneset targets
		repressed by the same factor. 2. a single set of query gene
		identifiers, whose members are expected to show divergent
		differential expression (non-directional query). For example,
		members of a particular signaling pathway, some of which may be
		up- some down-regulated in response to a stimulus. 3. a query
		with the complete results of a differential expression
		profiling experiment. For example, gene identifiers and
		z-scores from a previous perturbation experiment. gCMAPWeb
		accepts three types of identifiers: EntreIds, gene Symbols and
		microarray probe ids and can be configured to work with any
		species supported by Bioconductor. For each query submission,
		significantly similar reference datasets will be identified and
		reported in graphical and tabular form.
