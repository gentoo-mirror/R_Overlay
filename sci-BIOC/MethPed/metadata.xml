		A DNA methylation classifier tool for the identification of
		pediatric brain tumor subtypes // Classification of pediatric
		tumors into biologically defined subtypes is challenging and
		multifaceted approaches are needed. For this aim, we developed
		a diagnostic classifier based on DNA methylation profiles. We
		offer MethPed as an easy-to-use toolbox that allows researchers
		and clinical diagnosticians to test single samples as well as
		large cohorts for subclass prediction of pediatric brain
		tumors.  The current version of MethPed can classify the
		following tumor diagnoses/subgroups: Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine
		Glioma (DIPG), Ependymoma, Embryonal tumors with multilayered
		rosettes (ETMR), Glioblastoma (GBM), Medulloblastoma (MB) -
		Group 3 (MB_Gr3), Group 4 (MB_Gr3), Group WNT (MB_WNT), Group
		SHH (MB_SHH) and Pilocytic Astrocytoma (PiloAstro).
