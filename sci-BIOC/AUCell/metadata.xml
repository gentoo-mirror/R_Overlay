		AUCell: Analysis of 'gene set' activity in single-cell RNA-seq
		data (e.g. identify cells with specific gene signatures) //
		AUCell allows to identify cells with active gene sets (e.g.
		signatures, gene modules...) in single-cell RNA-seq data.
		AUCell uses the "Area Under the Curve" (AUC) to calculate
		whether a critical subset of the input gene set is enriched
		within the expressed genes for each cell. The distribution of
		AUC scores across all the cells allows exploring the relative
		expression of the signature. Since the scoring method is
		ranking-based, AUCell is independent of the gene expression
		units and the normalization procedure. In addition, since the
		cells are evaluated individually, it can easily be applied to
		bigger datasets, subsetting the expression matrix if needed.
