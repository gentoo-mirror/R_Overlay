		Tools to analyze in vivo microscopy imaging data focused on
		tracking flowing blood cells // flowcatchR is a set of tools to
		analyze in vivo microscopy imaging data, focused on tracking
		flowing blood cells. It guides the steps from segmentation to
		calculation of features, filtering out particles not of
		interest, providing also a set of utilities to help checking
		the quality of the performed operations (e.g. how good the
		segmentation was). It allows investigating the issue of
		tracking flowing cells such as in blood vessels, to categorize
		the particles in flowing, rolling and adherent. This
		classification is applied in the study of phenomena such as
		hemostasis and study of thrombosis development. Moreover,
		flowcatchR presents an integrated workflow solution, based on
		the integration with a Shiny App and Jupyter notebooks, which
		is delivered alongside the package, and can enable fully
		reproducible bioimage analysis in the R environment.
