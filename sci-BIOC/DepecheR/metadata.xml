		Determination of essential phenotypic elements of clusters in
		high-dimensional entities // The purpose of this package is to
		identify traits in a dataset that can separate groups. This is
		done on two levels. First, clustering is performed, using an
		implementation of sparse K-means. Secondly, the generated
		clusters are used to predict outcomes of groups of individuals
		based on their distribution of observations in the different
		clusters. As certain clusters with separating information will
		be identified, and these clusters are defined by a sparse
		number of variables, this method can reduce the complexity of
		data, to only emphasize the data that actually matters.
