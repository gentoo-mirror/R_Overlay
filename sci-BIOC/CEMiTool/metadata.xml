		Co-expression Modules identification Tool // The CEMiTool package
		unifies the discovery and the analysis of coexpression gene
		modules in a fully automatic manner, while providing a user-
		friendly html report with high quality graphs. Our tool
		evaluates if modules contain genes that are over-represented by
		specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample
		group. Additionally, CEMiTool is able to integrate
		transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying
		the potential hubs on each network.
