		Single Cell Differential Expression // The scde package
		implements a set of statistical methods for analyzing single-
		cell RNA-seq data. scde fits individual error models for
		single-cell RNA-seq measurements. These models can then be used
		for assessment of differential expression between groups of
		cells, as well as other types of analysis. The scde package
		also contains the pagoda framework which applies pathway and
		gene set overdispersion analysis to identify and characterize
		putative cell subpopulations based on transcriptional
		signatures. The overall approach to the differential expression
		analysis is detailed in the following publication: "Bayesian
		approach to single-cell differential expression analysis"
		(Kharchenko PV, Silberstein L, Scadden DT, Nature Methods, doi:
		10.1038/nmeth.2967). The overall approach to subpopulation
		identification and characterization is detailed in the
		following pre-print: "Characterizing transcriptional
		heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion
		analysis" (Fan J, Salathia N, Liu R, Kaeser G, Yung Y, Herman
		J, Kaper F, Fan JB, Zhang K, Chun J, and Kharchenko PV, Nature
		Methods, doi:10.1038/nmeth.3734).
