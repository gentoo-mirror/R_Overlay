		Detection of consensus regions inside a group of experiences
		using genomic positions and genomic ranges // This package
		compares genomic positions and genomic ranges from multiple
		experiments to extract common regions. The size of the analyzed
		region is adjustable as well as the number of experiences in
		which a feature must be present in a potential region to tag
		this region as a consensus region.
