		Controlling bias and inflation in association studies using the
		empirical null distribution // Bacon can be used to remove
		inflation and bias often observed in epigenome- and
		transcriptome-wide association studies. To this end bacon
		constructs an empirical null distribution using a Gibbs
		Sampling algorithm by fitting a three-component normal mixture
		on z-scores.
