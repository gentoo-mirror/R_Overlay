		Import, process and analysis of Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass
		Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) imaging data // This packages offers a
		pipeline for import, processing and analysis of ToF-SIMS 2D
		image data. Import of Iontof and Ulvac-Phi raw or preprocessed
		data is supported. For rawdata, mass calibration, peak picking
		and peak integration exist. General funcionality includes data
		binning, scaling, image subsetting and visualization. A range
		of multivariate tools common in the ToF-SIMS community are
		implemented (PCA, MCR, MAF, MNF). An interface to the
		bioconductor image processing package EBImage offers image
		segmentation functionality.
