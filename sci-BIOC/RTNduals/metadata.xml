		Analysis of co-regulation and inference of 'dual regulons' //
		RTNduals is a tool that searches for possible co-regulatory
		loops between regulon pairs generated by the RTN package. It
		compares the shared targets in order to infer 'dual regulons',
		a new concept that tests whether regulators can co-operate or
		compete in influencing targets.
