		Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with Networks // Biological
		molecules in a living organism seldom work individually. They
		usually interact each other in a cooperative way. Biological
		process is too complicated to understand without considering
		such interactions. Thus, network-based procedures can be seen
		as powerful methods for studying complex process. However, many
		methods are devised for analyzing individual genes. It is said
		that techniques based on biological networks such as gene co-
		expression are more precise ways to represent information than
		those using lists of genes only. This package is aimed to
		integrate the gene expression and biological network. A
		biological network is constructed from gene expression data and
		it is used for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
