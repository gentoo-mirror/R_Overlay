		Michaelis-Menten Modelling of Dropouts in single-cell RNASeq //
		This package fits a Michaelis-Menten model to the pattern of
		dropouts in single-cell RNASeq data. This model is used as a
		null to identify significantly variable (i.e. differentially
		expressed) genes for use in downstream analysis, such as
		clustering cells.
