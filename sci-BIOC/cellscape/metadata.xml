		Explores single cell copy number profiles in the context of a
		single cell tree // CellScape facilitates interactive browsing
		of single cell clonal evolution datasets. The tool requires two
		main inputs: (i) the genomic content of each single cell in the
		form of either copy number segments or targeted mutation
		values, and (ii) a single cell phylogeny. Phylogenetic formats
		can vary from dendrogram-like phylogenies with leaf nodes to
		evolutionary model-derived phylogenies with observed or latent
		internal nodes. The CellScape phylogeny is flexibly input as a
		table of source-target edges to support arbitrary
		representations, where each node may or may not have associated
		genomic data. The output of CellScape is an interactive
		interface displaying a single cell phylogeny and a cell-by-
		locus genomic heatmap representing the mutation status in each
		cell for each locus.
