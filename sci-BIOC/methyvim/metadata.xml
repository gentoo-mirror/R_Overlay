		Targeted, Robust, and Model-free Differential Methylation
		Analysis // This package provides facilities for differential
		methylation analysis based on variable importance measures
		(VIMs), a class of statistical target parameters that arise in
		causal inference. The estimation and inference procedures
		provided are nonparametric, relying on ensemble machine
		learning to flexibly assess functional relationships among
		covariates and the outcome of interest. These tools can be
		applied to differential methylation at the level of CpG sites,
		to obtain valid statistical inference even after corrections
		for multiple hypothesis testing.
