		Query data from SNPedia // SNPediaR provides some tools for
		downloading and parsing data from the SNPedia web site
		http://www.snpedia.com. The implemented functions allow users
		to import the wiki text available in SNPedia pages and to
		extract the most relevant information out of them. If some
		information in the downloaded pages is not automatically
		processed by the library functions, users can easily implement
		their own parsers to access it in an efficient way.
