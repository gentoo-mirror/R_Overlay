		Annotation and analysis of biological dynamical systems using
		flow cytometry // This package was developed for analysis of
		both dynamic and steady state experiments examining the
		function of gene regulatory networks in yeast (strain W303)
		expressing fluorescent reporter proteins using a BD Accuri C6
		and SORP cytometers. However, the functions are for the most
		part general and may be adapted for analysis of other organisms
		using other flow cytometers. Functions in this package
		facilitate the annotation of flow cytometry data with
		experimental metadata, as is requisite for dissemination and
		general ease-of-use. Functions for creating, saving and loading
		gate sets are also included. In the past, we have typically
		generated summary statistics for each flowset for each
		timepoint and then annotated and analyzed these summary
		statistics. This method loses a great deal of the power that
		comes from the large amounts of individual cell data generated
		in flow cytometry, by essentially collapsing this data into a
		bulk measurement after subsetting. In addition to these summary
		functions, this package also contains functions to facilitate
		annotation and analysis of steady-state or time-lapse data
		utilizing all of the data collected from the thousands of
		individual cells in each sample.
