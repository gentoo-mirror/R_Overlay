		A Genotype Calling Algorithm for Affymetrix SNP Arrays // A
		classification algorithm, based on a multi-chip, multi-SNP
		approach for Affymetrix SNP arrays. Using a large training
		sample where the genotype labels are known, this aglorithm will
		obtain more accurate classification results on new data. RLMM
		is based on a robust, linear model and uses the Mahalanobis
		distance for classification. The chip-to-chip non-biological
		variation is removed through normalization. This model-based
		algorithm captures the similarities across genotype groups and
		probes, as well as thousands other SNPs for accurate
		classification. NOTE: 100K-Xba only at for now.
