		The GASSCO method for correcting for slide-dependent gene-
		specific dye bias // Many two-colour hybridizations suffer from
		a dye bias that is both gene-specific and slide-specific. The
		former depends on the content of the nucleotide used for
		labeling; the latter depends on the labeling percentage. The
		slide-dependency was hitherto not recognized, and made
		addressing the artefact impossible.  Given a reasonable number
		of dye-swapped pairs of hybridizations, or of same vs. same
		hybridizations, both the gene- and slide-biases can be
		estimated and corrected using the GASSCO method (Margaritis et
		al., Mol. Sys. Biol. 5:266 (2009), doi:10.1038/msb.2009.21)
