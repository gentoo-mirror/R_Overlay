		cosmiq - COmbining Single Masses Into Quantities // cosmiq is a
		tool for the preprocessing of liquid- or gas - chromatography
		mass spectrometry (LCMS/GCMS) data with a focus on metabolomics
		or lipidomics applications. To improve the detection of low
		abundant signals, cosmiq generates master maps of the mZ/RT
		space from all acquired runs before a peak detection algorithm
		is applied. The result is a more robust identification and
		quantification of low-intensity MS signals compared to
		conventional approaches where peak picking is performed in each
		LCMS/GCMS file separately. The cosmiq package builds on the
		xcmsSet object structure and can be therefore integrated well
		with the package xcms as an alternative preprocessing step.
