		The Genomic STate ANnotation Package // Genome segmentation with
		hidden Markov models has become a useful tool to annotate
		genomic elements, such as promoters and enhancers. STAN
		(genomic STate ANnotation) implements (bidirectional) hidden
		Markov models (HMMs) using a variety of different probability
		distributions, which can model a wide range of current genomic
		data (e.g. continuous, discrete, binary). STAN de novo learns
		and annotates the genome into a given number of 'genomic
		states'. The 'genomic states' may for instance reflect distinct
		genome-associated protein complexes (e.g. 'transcription
		states') or describe recurring patterns of chromatin features
		(referred to as 'chromatin states'). Unlike other tools, STAN
		also allows for the integration of strand-specific (e.g. RNA)
		and non-strand-specific data (e.g. ChIP).
