		Pathway-based data integration of omics data // pwOmics performs
		pathway-based level-specific data comparison of matching omics
		data sets based on pre-analysed user-specified lists of
		differential genes/transcripts and phosphoproteins. A separate
		downstream analysis of phosphoproteomic data including pathway
		identification, transcription factor identification and target
		gene identification is opposed to the upstream analysis
		starting with gene or transcript information as basis for
		identification of upstream transcription factors and potential
		proteomic regulators. The cross-platform comparative analysis
		allows for comprehensive analysis of single time point
		experiments and time-series experiments by providing static and
		dynamic analysis tools for data integration. In addition, it
		provides functions to identify individual signaling axes based
		on data integration.
