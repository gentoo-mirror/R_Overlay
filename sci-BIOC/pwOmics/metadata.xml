		Pathway-based data integration of omics data // pwOmics performs
		pathway-based level-specific data comparison of matching omics
		data sets based on pre-analysed user-specified lists of
		differential genes/transcripts and proteins. A separate
		downstream analysis of proteomic data including pathway
		identification and enrichment analysis, transcription factor
		identification and target gene identification is opposed to the
		upstream analysis starting with gene or transcript information
		as basis for identification of upstream transcription factors
		and regulators. The cross-platform comparative analysis allows
		for comprehensive analysis of single time point experiments and
		time-series experiments by providing static and dynamic
		analysis tools for data integration.
