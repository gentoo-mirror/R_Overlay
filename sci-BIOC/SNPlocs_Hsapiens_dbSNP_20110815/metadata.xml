		SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 134) // SNP locations
		and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build
		134. The source data files used for this package were created
		by NCBI on Aug 15, 2011, and contain SNPs mapped to reference
		genome GRCh37.p2. WARNING: Note that the GRCh37.p2 genome is a
		patched version of GRCh37 but the patch doesn't alter
		chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT. GRCh37 itself is the same as the
		hg19 genome from UCSC *except* for the mitochondrion
		chromosome. Therefore, the SNPs in this package can be
		"injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 and they will land at
		the correct location but this injection will exclude chrM (i.e.
		nothing will be injected in that sequence).
