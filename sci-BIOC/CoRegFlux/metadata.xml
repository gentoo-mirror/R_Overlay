		CoRegFlux // CoRegFlux aims at providing tools to integrate
		reverse engineered gene regulatory networks and gene-expression
		into metabolic models to improve prediction of phenotypes, both
		for metabolic engineering, through transcription factor or gene
		(TF) knock-out or overexpression in various conditions as well
		as to improve our understanding of the interactions and cell
		inner-working.
