		TargetScore: Infer microRNA targets using microRNA-overexpression
		data and sequence information // Infer the posterior
		distributions of microRNA targets by probabilistically
		modelling the likelihood microRNA-overexpression fold-changes
		and sequence-based scores. Variaitonal Bayesian Gaussian
		mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied to log fold-changes and
		sequence scores to obtain the posteriors of latent variable
		being the miRNA targets. The final targetScore is computed as
		the sigmoid-transformed fold-change weighted by the averaged
		posteriors of target components over all of the features.
