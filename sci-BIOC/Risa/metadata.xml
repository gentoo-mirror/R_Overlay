		Converting experimental metadata from ISA-tab into Bioconductor
		data structures // The Investigation / Study / Assay (ISA) tab-
		delimited format is a general purpose framework with which to
		collect and communicate complex metadata (i.e. sample
		characteristics, technologies used, type of measurements made)
		from experiments employing a combination of technologies,
		spanning from traditional approaches to high-throughput
		techniques. Risa allows to access metadata/data in ISA-Tab
		format and build Bioconductor data structures. Currently, data
		generated from microarray, flow cytometry and metabolomics-
		based (i.e. mass spectrometry) assays are supported. The
		package is extendable and efforts are undergoing to support
		metadata associated to proteomics assays.
