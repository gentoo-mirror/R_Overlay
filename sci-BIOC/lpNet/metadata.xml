		Linear Programming Model for Network Inference // lpNet aims at
		infering biological networks, in particular signaling and gene
		networks. For that it takes perturbation data, either steady-
		state or time-series, as input and generates an LP model which
		allows the inference of signaling networks. For parameter
		identification either leave-one-out cross-validation or
		stratified n-fold cross-validation can be used.
