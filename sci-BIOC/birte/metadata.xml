		Bayesian Inference of Regulatory Influence on Expression (biRte)
		// Expression levels of mRNA molecules are regulated by
		different processes, comprising inhibition or activation by
		transcription factors and post-transcriptional degradation by
		microRNAs. biRte uses regulatory networks of TFs, miRNAs and
		possibly other factors, together with mRNA, miRNA and other
		available expression data to predict the relative influence of
		a regulator on the expression of its target genes. Inference is
		done in a Bayesian modeling framework using Markov-Chain-Monte-
		Carlo. A special feature is the possibility for follow-up
		network reverse engineering between active regulators.
