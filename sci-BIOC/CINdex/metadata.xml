		Chromosome Instability Index // The CINdex package addresses
		important area of high-throughput genomic analysis. It allows
		the automated processing and analysis of the experimental DNA
		copy number data generated by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays or
		similar high throughput technologies. It calculates the
		chromosome instability (CIN) index that allows to
		quantitatively characterize genome-wide DNA copy number
		alterations as a measure of chromosomal instability. This
		package calculates not only overall genomic instability, but
		also instability in terms of copy number gains and losses
		separately at the chromosome and cytoband level.
