		Linear model and normality based transformation method (Linnorm)
		// Linnorm is an R package for the analysis of RNA-seq, scRNA-
		seq, ChIP-seq count data or any large scale count data. It
		normalizes and performs variance-stabilizing transformation on
		such datasets. In addition to the transformtion function
		(Linnorm), the following pipelines are implemented: 1. Library
		size/Batch effect normalization (Linnorm.Norm), 2. Cell
		subpopluation analysis and visualization using t-SNE or PCA
		K-means clustering or Hierarchical clustering (Linnorm.tSNE,
		Linnorm.PCA, Linnorm.HClust), 3. Differential expression
		analysis or differential peak detection using limma
		(Linnorm.limma), 4. Highly variable gene discovery and
		visualization (Linnorm.HVar), 5. Gene correlation network
		analysis and visualization (Linnorm.Cor), 6. Stable gene
		selection for scRNA-seq data; for users without or do not want
		to rely on spike-in genes (Linnorm.SGenes). 7. Data imputation.
		(under development) (Linnorm.DataImput). Linnorm can work with
		raw count, CPM, RPKM, FPKM and TPM. Additionally, the RnaXSim
		function is included for simulating RNA-seq data for the
		evaluation of DEG analysis methods.
