		GWAS Incorporating Networks // martini deals with the low power
		inherent to GWAS studies by using prior knowledge represented
		as a network. SNPs are the vertices of the network, and the
		edges represent biological relationships between them (genomic
		adjacency, belonging to the same gene, physical interaction
		between protein products). The network is scanned using SConES,
		which looks for groups of SNPs maximally associated with the
		phenotype, that form a close subnetwork.
