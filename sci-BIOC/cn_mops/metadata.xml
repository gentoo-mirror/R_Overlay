		cn.mops - Mixture of Poissons for CNV detection in NGS data //
		cn.mops (Copy Number estimation by a Mixture Of PoissonS) is a
		data processing pipeline for copy number variations and
		aberrations (CNVs and CNAs) from next generation sequencing
		(NGS) data. The package supplies functions to convert BAM files
		into read count matrices or genomic ranges objects, which are
		the input objects for cn.mops. cn.mops models the depths of
		coverage across samples at each genomic position. Therefore, it
		does not suffer from read count biases along chromosomes. Using
		a Bayesian approach, cn.mops decomposes read variations across
		samples into integer copy numbers and noise by its mixture
		components and Poisson distributions, respectively. cn.mops
		guarantees a low FDR because wrong detections are indicated by
		high noise and filtered out. cn.mops is very fast and written
		in C++.
