		Detection of cell-type-specific risk-CpG sites in epigenome-wide
		association studies // In epigenome-wide association studies,
		the measured signals for each sample are a mixture of
		methylation profiles from different cell types. The current
		approaches to the association detection only claim whether a
		cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site is associated with the
		phenotype or not, but they cannot determine the cell type in
		which the risk-CpG site is affected by the phenotype. We
		propose a solid statistical method, HIgh REsolution (HIRE),
		which not only substantially improves the power of association
		detection at the aggregated level as compared to the existing
		methods but also enables the detection of risk-CpG sites for
		individual cell types. The "HIREewas" R package is to implement
		HIRE model in R.
