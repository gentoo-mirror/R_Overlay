		samExploreR package: high-performance read summarisation to count
		vectors with avaliability of sequencing depth reduction
		simulation // This R package is designed for subsampling
		procedure to simulate sequencing experiments with reduced
		sequencing depth. This package can be used to anlayze data
		generated from all major sequencing platforms such as Illumina
		GA, HiSeq, MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and LifeTech Ion PGM
		Proton sequencers. It supports multiple operating systems
		incluidng Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris. Was developed
		with usage of Rsubread.
