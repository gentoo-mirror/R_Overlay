		Multiple comparison test visualization // This package provides
		visualization of the results from the multiple (i.e. pairwise)
		comparison tests such as pairwise.t.test, pairwise.prop.test or
		pairwise.wilcox.test. The groups being compared are visualized
		as nodes in Hasse diagram. Such approach enables very clear and
		vivid depiction of which group is significantly greater than
		which others, especially if comparing a large number of groups.
