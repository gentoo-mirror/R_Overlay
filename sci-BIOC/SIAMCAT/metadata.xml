		Statistical Inference of Associations between Microbial
		Communities And host phenoTypes // Pipeline for Statistical
		Inference of Associations between Microbial Communities And
		host phenoTypes (SIAMCAT). A primary goal of analyzing
		microbiome data is to determine changes in community
		composition that are associated with environmental factors. In
		particular, linking human microbiome composition to host
		phenotypes such as diseases has become an area of intense
		research. For this, robust statistical modeling and biomarker
		extraction toolkits are crucially needed. SIAMCAT provides a
		full pipeline supporting data preprocessing, statistical
		association testing, statistical modeling (LASSO logistic
		regression) including tools for evaluation and interpretation
		of these models (such as cross validation, parameter selection,
		ROC analysis and diagnostic model plots).
