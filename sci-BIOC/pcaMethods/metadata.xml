		A collection of PCA methods // Provides Bayesian PCA,
		Probabilistic PCA, Nipals PCA, Inverse Non-Linear PCA and the
		conventional SVD PCA. A cluster based method for missing value
		estimation is included for comparison. BPCA, PPCA and NipalsPCA
		may be used to perform PCA on incomplete data as well as for
		accurate missing value estimation. A set of methods for
		printing and plotting the results is also provided. All PCA
		methods make use of the same data structure (pcaRes) to provide
		a common interface to the PCA results. Initiated at the Max-
		Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, Golm, Germany.
