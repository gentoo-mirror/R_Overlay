		Q-value estimation for false discovery rate control // This
		package takes a list of p-values resulting from the
		simultaneous testing of many hypotheses and estimates their
		q-values and local FDR values. The q-value of a test measures
		the proportion of false positives incurred (called the false
		discovery rate) when that particular test is called
		significant. The local FDR measures the posterior probability
		the null hypothesis is true given the test's p-value. Various
		plots are automatically generated, allowing one to make
		sensible significance cut-offs. Several mathematical results
		have recently been shown on the conservative accuracy of the
		estimated q-values from this software. The software can be
		applied to problems in genomics, brain imaging, astrophysics,
		and data mining.
