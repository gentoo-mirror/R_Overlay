		Infer miRNA-mRNA interactions using paired expression data from a
		single sample // Infer Probabilities of MiRNA-mRNA Interaction
		Signature (ProMISe) using paired expression data from a single
		sample. Roleswitch operates in two phases by inferring the
		probability of mRNA (miRNA) being the targets ("targets") of
		miRNA (mRNA), taking into account the expression of all of the
		mRNAs (miRNAs) due to their potential competition for the same
		miRNA (mRNA). Due to dynamic miRNA repression in the cell,
		Roleswitch assumes that the total transcribed mRNA levels are
		higher than the observed (equilibrium) mRNA levels and
		iteratively updates the total transcription of each mRNA
		targets based on the above inference. NB: in the paper, we used
		ProMISe as both the model name and inferred score name.
