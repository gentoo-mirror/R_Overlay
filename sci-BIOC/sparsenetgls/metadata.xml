		Using Gaussian graphical structue learning estimation in
		generalized least squared regression for multivariate normal
		regression // The package provides methods of combining the
		graph structure learning and generalized least squares
		regression to improve the regression estimation. The main
		function sparsenetgls() provides solutions for multivariate
		regression with Gaussian distributed dependant variables and
		explanatory variables utlizing multiple well-known graph
		structure learning approaches to estimating the precision
		matrix, and uses a penalized variance covariance matrix with a
		distance tuning parameter of the graph structure in deriving
		the sandwich estimators in generalized least squares (gls)
		regression. This package also provides functions for assessing
		a Gaussian graphical model which uses the  penalized approach.
		It uses Receiver Operative Characteristics curve as a
		visualization tool in the assessment.
