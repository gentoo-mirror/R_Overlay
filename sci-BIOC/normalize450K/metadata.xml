		Preprocessing of Illumina Infinium 450K data // Precise
		measurements are important for epigenome-wide studies
		investigating DNA methylation in whole blood samples, where
		effect sizes are expected to be small in magnitude. The 450K
		platform is often affected by batch effects and proper
		preprocessing is recommended. This package provides functions
		to read and normalize 450K '.idat' files. The normalization
		corrects for dye bias and biases related to signal intensity
		and methylation of probes using local regression. No adjustment
		for probe type bias is performed to avoid the trade-off of
		precision for accuracy of beta-values.
