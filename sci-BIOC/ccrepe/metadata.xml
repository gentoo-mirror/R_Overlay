		ccrepe_and_nc.score // The CCREPE (Compositionality Corrected by
		REnormalizaion and PErmutation) package is designed to assess
		the significance of general similarity measures in
		compositional datasets.  In microbial abundance data, for
		example, the total abundances of all microbes sum to one;
		CCREPE is designed to take this constraint into account when
		assigning p-values to similarity measures between the microbes.
		The package has two functions: ccrepe:    Calculates similarity
		measures, p-values and q-values for relative abundances of bugs
		in one or two body sites using bootstrap and permutation
		matrices of the data. nc.score:  Calculates species-level co-
		variation and co-exclusion patterns based on an extension of
		the checkerboard score to ordinal data.
