		Mixture Nested Effects Models // Mixture Nested Effects Models
		(mnem) is an extension of Nested Effects Models and allows for
		the analysis of single cell perturbation data provided by
		methods like Perturb-Seq (Dixit et al., 2016) or Crop-Seq
		(Datlinger et al., 2017). In those experiments each of many
		cells is perturbed by a knock-down of a specific gene, i.e.
		several cells are perturbed by a knock-down of gene A, several
		by a knock-down of gene B, ... and so forth. The observed read-
		out has to be multi-trait and in the case of the Perturb-/Crop-
		Seq gene are expression profiles for each cell. mnem uses a
		mixture model to simultaneously cluster the cell population
		into k clusters and and infer k networks causally linking the
		perturbed genes for each cluster. The mixture components are
		inferred via an expectation maximization algorithm.
