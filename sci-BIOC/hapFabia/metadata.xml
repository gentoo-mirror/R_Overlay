		hapFabia: Identification of very short segments of identity by
		descent (IBD) characterized by rare variants in large
		sequencing data // A package to identify very short IBD
		segments in large sequencing data by FABIA biclustering. Two
		haplotypes are identical by descent (IBD) if they share a
		segment that both inherited from a common ancestor. Current IBD
		methods reliably detect long IBD segments because many minor
		alleles in the segment are concordant between the two
		haplotypes. However, many cohort studies contain unrelated
		individuals which share only short IBD segments. This package
		provides software to identify short IBD segments in sequencing
		data. Knowledge of short IBD segments are relevant for phasing
		of genotyping data, association studies, and for population
		genetics, where they shed light on the evolutionary history of
		humans. The package supports VCF formats, is based on sparse
		matrix operations, and provides visualization of haplotype
		clusters in different formats.
