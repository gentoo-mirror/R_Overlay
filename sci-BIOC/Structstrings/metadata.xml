		Implementation of the dot bracket annotations with Biostrings //
		The Structstrings package implements the widely used dot
		bracket annotation for storing base pairing information in
		structured RNA. Structstrings uses the infrastructure provided
		by the Biostrings package and derives the DotBracketString and
		related classes from the BString class. From these, base pair
		tables can be produced for in depth analysis. In addition, the
		loop indices of the base pairs can be retrieved as well. For
		better efficiency, information conversion is implemented in C,
		inspired to a large extend by the ViennaRNA package.
