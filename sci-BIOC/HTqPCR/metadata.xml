		Automated analysis of high-throughput qPCR data // Analysis of Ct
		values from high throughput quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
		assays across multiple conditions or replicates. The input data
		can be from spatially-defined formats such ABI TaqMan Low
		Density Arrays or OpenArray; LightCycler from Roche Applied
		Science; the CFX plates from Bio-Rad Laboratories; conventional
		96- or 384-well plates; or microfluidic devices such as the
		Dynamic Arrays from Fluidigm Corporation. HTqPCR handles data
		loading, quality assessment, normalization, visualization and
		parametric or non-parametric testing for statistical
		significance in Ct values between features (e.g. genes,
		microRNAs).
