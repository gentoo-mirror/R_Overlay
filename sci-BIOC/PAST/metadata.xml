		Pathway Association Study Tool (PAST) // PAST takes GWAS output
		and assigns SNPs to genes, uses those genes to find pathways
		associated with the genes, and plots pathways based on
		significance. Implements methods for reading GWAS input data,
		finding genes associated with SNPs, calculating enrichment
		score and significance of pathways, and plotting pathways.
