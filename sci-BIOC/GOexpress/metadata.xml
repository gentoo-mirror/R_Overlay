		Visualise microarray and RNAseq data using gene ontology
		annotations // The package contains methods to visualise the
		expression profile of genes from a microarray or RNA-seq
		experiment, and offers a supervised clustering approach to
		identify GO terms containing genes with expression levels that
		best classify two or more predefined groups of samples.
		Annotations for the genes present in the expression dataset may
		be obtained from Ensembl through the biomaRt package, if not
		provided by the user. The default random forest framework is
		used to evaluate the capacity of each gene to cluster samples
		according to the factor of interest. Finally, GO terms are
		scored by averaging the rank (alternatively, score) of their
		respective gene sets to cluster the samples. P-values may be
		computed to assess the significance of GO term ranking.
		Visualisation function include gene expression profile, gene
		ontology-based heatmaps, and hierarchical clustering of
		experimental samples using gene expression data.
