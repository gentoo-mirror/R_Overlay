		Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R //
		Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles
		with biological replication. Implements a range of statistical
		methodology based on the negative binomial distributions,
		including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests, generalized
		linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq,
		it be applied to differential signal analysis of other types of
		genomic data that produce counts, including ChIP-seq,
		Bisulfite-seq, SAGE and CAGE.
