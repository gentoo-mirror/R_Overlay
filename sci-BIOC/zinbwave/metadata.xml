		Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model for RNA-Seq Data //
		Implements a general and flexible zero-inflated negative
		binomial model that can be used to provide a low-dimensional
		representations of single-cell RNA-seq data. The model accounts
		for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count
		nature of the data. The model also accounts for the difference
		in library sizes and optionally for batch effects and/or other
		covariates, avoiding the need for pre-normalize the data.
