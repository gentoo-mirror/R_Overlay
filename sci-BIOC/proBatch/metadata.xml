		Tools for Diagnostics and Corrections of Batch Effects in
		Proteomics // The proBatch package facilitates batch effects
		analysis and correction in high-thoughput experiments. It was
		developed primarily for mass-spectrometry proteomics
		(DIA/SWATH), but could also be applicable to most omic data
		with minor adaptations. The package contains functions for
		diagnostics (proteome/genome-wide and feature-level),
		correction (normalization and batch effects correction) and
		quality control. Non-linear fitting based approaches were also
		included to deal with complex, mass spectrometry-specific
		signal drifts.
