		A Framework for visualizing gene set enrichment throughout
		neurodevelopment // BrainImageR is a package that provides the
		user with information of where in the human brain their gene
		set corresponds to. This is provided both as a continuous
		variable and as a easily-interpretable image. BrainImageR has
		additional functionality of identifying approximately when in
		developmental time that a gene expression dataset corresponds
		to. Both the spatial gene set enrichment and the developmental
		time point prediction are assessed in comparison to the Allen
		Brain Atlas reference data.
