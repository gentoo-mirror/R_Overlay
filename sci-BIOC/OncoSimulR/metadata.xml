		Forward Genetic Simulation of Cancer Progresion with Epistasis //
		Functions for forward population genetic simulation in asexual
		populations, with special focus on cancer progression. Fitness
		can be an arbitrary function of genetic interactions between
		multiple genes or modules of genes, including epistasis, order
		restrictions in mutation accumulation, and order effects.
		Simulations use continuous-time models and can include driver
		and passenger genes and modules.  Also included are functions
		for simulating random DAGs of the type found in Oncogenetic
		Tress, Conjunctive Bayesian Networks, and other tumor
		progression models, and for plotting and sampling from single
		or multiple realizations of the simulations, including single-
		cell sampling, as well as functions for plotting the true
		phylogenetic relationships of the clones.
