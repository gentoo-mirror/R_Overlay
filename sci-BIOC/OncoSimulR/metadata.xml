		Forward Genetic Simulation of Cancer Progression with Epistasis
		// Functions for forward population genetic simulation in
		asexual populations, with special focus on cancer progression.
		Fitness can be an arbitrary function of genetic interactions
		between multiple genes or modules of genes, including
		epistasis, order restrictions in mutation accumulation, and
		order effects.  Mutation rates can differ between genes, and we
		can include mutator/antimutator genes (to model mutator
		phenotypes). Simulations use continuous-time models and can
		include driver and passenger genes and modules.  Also included
		are functions for: simulating random DAGs of the type found in
		Oncogenetic Trees, Conjunctive Bayesian Networks, and other
		cancer progression models; plotting and sampling from single or
		multiple realizations of the simulations, including single-cell
		sampling; plotting the parent-child relationships of the
		clones; generating random fitness landscapes (Rough Mount Fuji,
		House of Cards, and additive models) and plotting them.
