		Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment (ACME) // ACME
		(Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment) is a set of
		tools for analysing tiling array ChIP/chip, DNAse
		hypersensitivity, or other experiments that result in regions
		of the genome showing "enrichment".  It does not rely on a
		specific array technology (although the array should be a
		"tiling" array), is very general (can be applied in experiments
		resulting in regions of enrichment), and is very insensitive to
		array noise or normalization methods.  It is also very fast and
		can be applied on whole-genome tiling array experiments quite
		easily with enough memory.
