		Semi-Supervised Mixture Model // Useful for detecting SNPs with
		interactive effects on a quantitative trait. This R packages
		moves away from testing interaction terms, and moves towards
		testing whether an individual SNP is involved in any
		interaction. This reduces the multiple testing burden to one
		test per SNP, and allows for interactions with unobserved
		factors. Analysing one SNP at a time, it splits the individuals
		into two groups, based on the number of minor alleles. If the
		quantitative trait differs in mean between the two groups, the
		SNP has a main effect. If the quantitative trait differs in
		distribution between some individuals in one group and all
		other individuals, it possibly has an interactive effect.
		Implicitly, the membership probabilities may suggest potential
		interacting variables.
