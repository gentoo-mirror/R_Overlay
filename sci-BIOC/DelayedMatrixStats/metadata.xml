		Functions that Apply to Rows and Columns of 'DelayedMatrix'
		Objects // A port of the 'matrixStats' API for use with
		DelayedMatrix objects from the 'DelayedArray' package. High-
		performing functions operating on rows and columns of
		DelayedMatrix objects, e.g. col / rowMedians(), col /
		rowRanks(), and col / rowSds(). Functions optimized per data
		type and for subsetted calculations such that both memory usage
		and processing time is minimized.
