		Mapping cell populations in flow cytometry data for cross-sample
		comparisons using the Friedman-Rafsky Test // flowMap
		quantifies the similarity of cell populations across multiple
		flow cytometry samples using a nonparametric multivariate
		statistical test. The method is able to map cell populations of
		different size, shape, and proportion across multiple flow
		cytometry samples. The algorithm can be incorporate in any flow
		cytometry work flow that requires accurat quantification of
		similarity between cell populations.
