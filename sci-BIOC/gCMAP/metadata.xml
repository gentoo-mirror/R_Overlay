		Tools for Connectivity Map-like analyses // The gCMAP package
		provides a toolkit for comparing differential gene expression
		profiles through gene set enrichment analysis. Starting from
		normalized microarray or RNA-seq gene expression values (stored
		in lists of ExpressionSet and CountDataSet objects) the package
		performs differential expression analysis using the limma or
		DESeq packages. Supplying a simple list of gene identifiers,
		global differential expression profiles or data from complete
		experiments as input, users can use a unified set of several
		well-known gene set enrichment analysis methods to retrieve
		experiments with similar changes in gene expression. To take
		into account the directionality of gene expression changes,
		gCMAPQuery introduces the SignedGeneSet class, directly
		extending GeneSet from the GSEABase package.  To increase
		performance of large queries, multiple gene sets are stored as
		sparse incidence matrices within CMAPCollection eSets. gCMAP
		offers implementations of 1. Fisher's exact test (Fisher, J R
		Stat Soc, 1922) 2. The "connectivity map" method (Lamb et al,
		Science, 2006) 3. Parametric and non-parametric t-statistic
		summaries (Jiang  Gentleman, Bioinformatics, 2007) and 4.
		Wilcoxon / Mann-Whitney rank sum statistics (Wilcoxon,
		Biometrics Bulletin, 1945) as well as wrappers for the 5.
		camera (Wu  Smyth, Nucleic Acid Res, 2012) 6. mroast and romer
		(Wu et al, Bioinformatics, 2010) functions from the limma
		package and 7. wraps the gsea method from the mgsa package
		(Bauer et al, NAR, 2010). All methods return CMAPResult
		objects, an S4 class inheriting from AnnotatedDataFrame,
		containing enrichment statistics as well as annotation data and
		providing simple high-level summary plots.
