		Creation and Analysis of Pathway Expression Profiles (PEPs) //
		Pathway Expression Profiles (PEPs) are based on the expression
		of pathways (defined as sets of genes) as opposed to individual
		genes. This package converts gene expression profiles to PEPs
		and performs enrichment analysis of both pathways and
		experimental conditions, such as "drug set enrichment analysis"
		and "gene2drug" drug discovery analysis respectively.
