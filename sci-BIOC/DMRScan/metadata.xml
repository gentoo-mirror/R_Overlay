		Detection of Differentially Methylated Regions // This package
		detects significant differentially methylated regions (for both
		qualitative and quantitative traits), using a scan statistic
		with underlying Poisson heuristics. The scan statistic will
		depend on a sequence of window sizes (# of CpGs within each
		window) and on a threshold for each window size. This threshold
		can be calculated by three different means: i) analytically
		using Siegmund et.al (2012) solution (preferred), ii) an
		important sampling as suggested by Zhang (2008), and a iii)
		full MCMC modeling of the data, choosing between a number of
		different options for modeling the dependency between each CpG.
