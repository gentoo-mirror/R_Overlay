		Optimized Functional Annotation Of ChIP-seq Data // geneXtendeR
		optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks by
		exploring relative differences in annotating ChIP-seq peak sets
		to variable-length gene bodies.  In contrast to prior
		techniques, geneXtendeR considers peak annotations beyond just
		the closest gene, allowing users to see peak summary statistics
		for the first-closest gene, second-closest gene, ..., n-closest
		gene whilst ranking the output according to biologically
		relevant events and iteratively comparing the fidelity of peak-
		to-gene overlap across a user-defined range of upstream and
		downstream extensions on the original boundaries of each gene's
		coordinates.  Since different ChIP-seq peak callers produce
		different differentially enriched peaks with a large variance
		in peak length distribution and total peak count, annotating
		peak lists with their nearest genes can often be a noisy
		process.  As such, the goal of geneXtendeR is to robustly link
		differentially enriched peaks with their respective genes,
		thereby aiding experimental follow-up and validation in
		designing primers for a set of prospective gene candidates
		during qPCR.
