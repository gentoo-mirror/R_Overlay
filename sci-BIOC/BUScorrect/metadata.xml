		Batch Effects Correction with Unknown Subtypes // High-throughput
		experimental data are accumulating exponentially in public
		databases. However, mining valid scientific discoveries from
		these abundant resources is hampered by technical artifacts and
		inherent biological heterogeneity. The former are usually
		termed "batch effects," and the latter is often modelled by
		"subtypes." The R package BUScorrect fits a Bayesian
		hierarchical model, the Batch-effects-correction-with-Unknown-
		Subtypes model (BUS), to correct batch effects in the presence
		of unknown subtypes. BUS is capable of (a) correcting batch
		effects explicitly, (b) grouping samples that share similar
		characteristics into subtypes, (c) identifying features that
		distinguish subtypes, and (d) enjoying a linear-order
		computation complexity.
