		Detect the correlated mutations based on selection pressure //
		CorMut provides functions for computing kaks for individual
		sites or specific amino acids and detecting correlated
		mutations among them. Three methods are provided for detecting
		correlated mutations ,including conditional selection pressure,
		mutual information and Jaccard index. The computation consists
		of two steps: First, the positive selection sites are detected;
		Second, the mutation correlations are computed among the
		positive selection sites. Note that the first step is optional.
		Meanwhile, CorMut facilitates the comparison of the correlated
		mutations between two conditions by the means of correlated
		mutation network.
