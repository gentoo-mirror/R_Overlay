		R interface to a subset of OpenBabel functionalities //
		ChemmineOB provides an R interface to a subset of
		cheminformatics functionalities implemented by the OpelBabel
		C++ project. OpenBabel is an open source cheminformatics
		toolbox that includes utilities for structure format
		interconversions, descriptor calculations, compound similarity
		searching and more. ChemineOB aims to make a subset of these
		utilities available from within R. For non-developers,
		ChemineOB is primarily intended to be used from ChemmineR as an
		add-on package rather than used directly.
