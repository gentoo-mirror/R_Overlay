		SRGnet: An R package for studying synergistic response to gene
		mutations from transcriptomics data from transcriptomics data
		// We developed SRGnet to analyze synergistic regulatory
		mechanisms in transcriptome profiles that act to enhance the
		overall cell response to combination of mutations, drugs or
		environmental exposure. This package can be used to identify
		regulatory modules downstream of synergistic response genes,
		prioritize synergistic regulatory genes that may be potential
		intervention targets, and contextualize gene perturbation
		experiments.
