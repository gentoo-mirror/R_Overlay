		Global Test for Counts // The method may be conceptualised as a
		test of overall significance in regression analysis, where the
		response variable is overdispersed and the number of
		explanatory variables exceeds the sample size. Useful for
		testing for association between RNA-Seq and high-dimensional
		data.
