		Shiny app GUI wrapper for ggplot with built-in statistical
		analysis // A shiny app-based GUI wrapper for ggplot with
		built-in statistical analysis. Import data from file and use
		dropdown menus and checkboxes to specify the plotting
		variables, graph type, and look of your plots. Once created,
		plots can be saved independently or stored in a report that can
		be saved as a pdf. If new data are added to the file, the
		report can be refreshed to include new data. Statistical tests
		can be selected and added to the graphs. Analysis of flow
		cytometry data is especially integrated with plotGrouper. Count
		data can be transformed to return the absolute number of cells
		in a sample (this feature requires inclusion of the number of
		beads per sample and information about any dilution performed).
