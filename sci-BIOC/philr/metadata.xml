		Phylogenetic partitioning based ILR transform for metagenomics
		data // PhILR is short for Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio
		Transform. This package provides functions for the analysis of
		compositional data (e.g., data representing proportions of
		different variables/parts). Specifically this package allows
		analysis of compositional data where the parts can be related
		through a phylogenetic tree  (as is common in microbiota survey
		data) and makes available the Isometric Log Ratio transform
		built from the phylogenetic tree and utilizing a weighted
		reference measure.
