		Prediction of Oligomerization of Coiled Coil Proteins // The
		package allows for predicting whether a coiled coil sequence
		(amino acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to
		form a dimer or more likely to form a trimer. Additionally to
		the prediction itself, a prediction profile is computed which
		allows for determining the strengths to which the individual
		residues are indicative for either class. Prediction profiles
		can also be visualized as curves or heatmaps.
