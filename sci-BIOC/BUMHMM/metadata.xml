		Computational pipeline for computing probability of modification
		from structure probing experiment data // This is a
		probabilistic modelling pipeline for computing per- nucleotide
		posterior probabilities of modification from the data collected
		in structure probing experiments. The model supports multiple
		experimental replicates and empirically corrects coverage- and
		sequence-dependent biases. The model utilises the measure of a
		"drop-off rate" for each nucleotide, which is compared between
		replicates through a log-ratio (LDR). The LDRs between control
		replicates define a null distribution of variability in drop-
		off rate observed by chance and LDRs between treatment and
		control replicates gets compared to this distribution.
		Resulting empirical p-values (probability of being "drawn" from
		the null distribution) are used as observations in a Hidden
		Markov Model with a Beta-Uniform Mixture model used as an
		emission model. The resulting posterior probabilities indicate
		the probability of a nucleotide of having being modified in a
		structure probing experiment.
