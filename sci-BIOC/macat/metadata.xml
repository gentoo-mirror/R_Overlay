		MicroArray Chromosome Analysis Tool // This library contains
		functions to investigate links between differential gene
		expression and the chromosomal localization of the genes. MACAT
		is motivated by the common observation of phenomena involving
		large chromosomal regions in tumor cells. MACAT is the
		implementation of a statistical approach for identifying
		significantly differentially expressed chromosome regions. The
		functions have been tested on a publicly available data set
		about acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Yeoh et al.Cancer Cell
		2002), which is provided in the library 'stjudem'.
