		Extraction of Differential Gene Expression // The edge package
		implements methods for carrying out differential expression
		analyses of genome-wide gene expression studies. Significance
		testing using the optimal discovery procedure and generalized
		likelihood ratio tests (equivalent to F-tests and t-tests) are
		implemented for general study designs. Special functions are
		available to facilitate the analysis of common study designs,
		including time course experiments. Other packages such as snm,
		sva, and qvalue are integrated in edge to provide a wide range
		of tools for gene expression analysis.
