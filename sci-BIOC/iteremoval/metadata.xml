		Iteration removal method for feature selection // The package
		provides a flexible algorithm to screen features of two
		distinct groups in consideration of overfitting and overall
		performance. It was originally tailored for methylation locus
		screening of NGS data, and it can also be used as a generic
		method for feature selection. Each step of the algorithm
		provides a default method for simple implemention, and the
		method can be replaced by a user defined function.
