		Enabling stream processing of large files // Large data files can
		be difficult to work with in R, where data generally resides in
		memory. This package encourages a style of programming where
		data is 'streamed' from disk into R via a `producer' and
		through a series of `consumers' that, typically reduce the
		original data to a manageable size. The package provides useful
		Producer and Consumer stream components for operations such as
		data input, sampling, indexing, and transformation; see
		package?Streamer for details.
