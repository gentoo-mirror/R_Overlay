		mapscape // MapScape integrates clonal prevalence, clonal
		hierarchy, anatomic and mutational information to provide
		interactive visualization of spatial clonal evolution. There
		are four inputs to MapScape: (i) the clonal phylogeny, (ii)
		clonal prevalences, (iii) an image reference, which may be a
		medical image or drawing and (iv) pixel locations for each
		sample on the referenced image. Optionally, MapScape can accept
		a data table of mutations for each clone and their variant
		allele frequencies in each sample. The output of MapScape
		consists of a cropped anatomical image surrounded by two
		representations of each tumour sample. The first, a cellular
		aggregate, visually displays the prevalence of each clone. The
		second shows a skeleton of the clonal phylogeny while
		highlighting only those clones present in the sample. Together,
		these representations enable the analyst to visualize the
		distribution of clones throughout anatomic space.
