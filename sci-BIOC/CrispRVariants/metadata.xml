		Tools for counting and visualising mutations in a target location
		// CrispRVariants provides tools for analysing the results of a
		CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis sequencing experiment, or other
		sequencing experiments where variants within a given region are
		of interest. These tools allow users to localize variant allele
		combinations with respect to any genomic location (e.g. the
		Cas9 cut site), plot allele combinations and calculate mutation
		rates with flexible filtering of unrelated variants.
