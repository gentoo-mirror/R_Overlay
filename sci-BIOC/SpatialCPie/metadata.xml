		Cluster analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics data // SpatialCPie
		is an R package designed to facilitate cluster evaluation for
		spatial transcriptomics data by providing intuitive
		visualizations that display the relationships between clusters
		in order to guide the user during cluster identification and
		other downstream applications. The package is built around a
		shiny "gadget" to allow the exploration of the data with
		multiple plots in parallel and an interactive UI. The user can
		easily toggle between different cluster resolutions in order to
		choose the most appropriate visual cues.
