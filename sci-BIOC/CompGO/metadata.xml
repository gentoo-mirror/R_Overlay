		An R pipeline for .bed file annotation, comparing GO term
		enrichment between gene sets and data visualisation // This
		package contains functions to accomplish several tasks. It is
		able to download full genome databases from UCSC, import .bed
		files easily, annotate these .bed file regions with genes (plus
		distance) from aforementioned database dumps, interface with
		DAVID to create functional annotation and gene ontology
		enrichment charts based on gene lists (such as those generated
		from input .bed files) and finally visualise and compare these
		enrichments using either directed acyclic graphs or
		scatterplots.
