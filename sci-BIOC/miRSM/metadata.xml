		Inferring miRNA sponge modules by integrating expression data and
		miRNA-target binding information // The package aims to
		identify miRNA sponge modules by integrating expression data
		and miRNA-target binding information. It provides several
		functions to study miRNA sponge modules, including popular
		methods for inferring gene modules (candidate miRNA sponge
		modules), and a function to identify miRNA sponge modules, as
		well as several functions to conduct modular analysis of miRNA
		sponge modules.
