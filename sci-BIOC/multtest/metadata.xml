		Resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing // Non-parametric
		bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple testing
		procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling
		the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise
		error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion of false
		positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR).  Several
		choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are implemented
		(centered, centered and scaled, quantile-transformed). Single-
		step and step-wise methods are available. Tests based on a
		variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on
		regression parameters from linear and survival models as well
		as those based on correlation parameters) are included.  When
		probing hypotheses with t-statistics, users may also select a
		potentially faster null distribution which is multivariate
		normal with mean zero and variance covariance matrix derived
		from the vector influence function.  Results are reported in
		terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions and test
		statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to
		identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray
		experiments.
