		LEA: an R package for Landscape and Ecological Association
		Studies // LEA is an R package dedicated to landscape genomics
		and ecological association tests. LEA can run analyses of
		population structure and genome scans for local adaptation. It
		includes statistical methods for estimating ancestry
		coefficients from large genotypic matrices and evaluating the
		number of ancestral populations (snmf, pca); and identifying
		genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with some
		environmental gradient or with the variables used as proxies
		for ecological pressures (lfmm), and controlling the false
		discovery rate. LEA is mainly based on optimized C programs
		that can scale with the dimension of very large data sets.
