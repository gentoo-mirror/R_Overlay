		LEA: an R package for Landscape and Ecological Association
		Studies // LEA is an R package dedicated to landscape genomics
		and ecological association tests. LEA can run analyses of
		population structure and genomewide tests for local adaptation.
		The package includes statistical methods for estimating
		ancestry coefficients from large genotypic matrices and for
		evaluating the number of ancestral populations (snmf, pca). It
		performs statistical tests using latent factor mixed models for
		identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit association with
		environmental gradients or phenotypic traits (lfmm). LEA is
		mainly based on optimized C programs that can scale with the
		dimension of large data sets.
