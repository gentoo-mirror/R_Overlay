		Statistical Analysis of High-Throughput Genetic Perturbation
		Screens // perturbatr does stage-wise analysis of large-scale
		genetic perturbation screens for integrated data sets
		consisting of multiple screens. For multiple integrated
		perturbation screens a hierarchical model that considers the
		variance between different biological conditions is fitted. The
		resulting list of gene effects is then further extended using a
		network propagation algorithm to correct for false negatives.
