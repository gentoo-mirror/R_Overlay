		Addon to CellNOptR: Fuzzy Logic // This package is an extension
		to CellNOptR.  It contains additional functionality needed to
		simulate and train a prior knowledge network to experimental
		data using constrained fuzzy logic (cFL, rather than Boolean
		logic as is the case in CellNOptR).  Additionally, this package
		will contain functions to use for the compilation of multiple
		optimization results (either Boolean or cFL).
