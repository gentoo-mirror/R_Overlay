		Transcription Factor High Accumulation Zones // It finds
		trascription factor (TF) high accumulation DNA zones, i.e.,
		regions along the genome where there is a high presence of
		different transcription factors. Starting from a dataset
		containing the genomic positions of TF binding regions, for
		each base of the selected chromosome the accumulation of TFs is
		computed. Three different types of accumulation (TF, region and
		base accumulation) are available, together with the possibility
		of considering, in the single base accumulation computing, the
		TFs present not only in that single base, but also in its
		neighborhood, within a window of a given width. Two different
		methods for the search of TF high accumulation DNA zones,
		called "binding regions" and "overlaps", are available. In
		addition, some functions are provided in order to analyze,
		visualize and compare results obtained with different input
		parameters.
