		Computes the Quaternary Dot Product Scoring Statistic for Signed
		and Unsigned Causal Graphs // QuaternaryProd is an R package
		that performs causal reasoning on biological networks,
		including publicly available networks such as STRINGdb.
		QuaternaryProd is an open-source alternative to commercial
		products such as Inginuity Pathway Analysis. For a given a set
		of differentially expressed genes, QuaternaryProd computes the
		significance of upstream regulators in the network by
		performing causal reasoning using the Quaternary Dot Product
		Scoring Statistic (Quaternary Statistic), Ternary Dot product
		Scoring Statistic (Ternary Statistic) and Fisher's exact test
		(Enrichment test). The Quaternary Statistic handles signed,
		unsigned and ambiguous edges in the network. Ambiguity arises
		when the direction of causality is unknown, or when the source
		node (e.g., a protein) has edges with conflicting signs for the
		same target gene. On the other hand, the Ternary Statistic
		provides causal reasoning using the signed and unambiguous
		edges only. The Vignette provides more details on the
		Quaternary Statistic and illustrates an example of how to
		perform causal reasoning using STRINGdb.
