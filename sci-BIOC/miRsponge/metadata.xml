		Identification and analysis of miRNA sponge interaction networks
		and modules // The name of the miRsponge package has been
		changed into "miRspongeR". Future updates will be seen in the
		miRspongeR package
		(http://bioconductor.org/packages/miRspongeR/). This package
		provides several functions to study miRNA sponge (also called
		ceRNA or miRNA decoy), including popular methods for
		identifying miRNA sponge interactions, and the integrative
		method to integrate miRNA sponge interactions from different
		methods, as well as the functions to validate miRNA sponge
		interactions, and infer miRNA sponge modules, conduct
		enrichment analysis of modules, and conduct survival analysis
		of modules.
