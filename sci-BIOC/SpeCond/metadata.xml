		Condition specific detection from expression data // This package
		performs a gene expression data analysis to detect condition-
		specific genes. Such genes are significantly up- or down-
		regulated in a small number of conditions. It does so by
		fitting a mixture of normal distributions to the expression
		values. Conditions can be environmental conditions, different
		tissues, organs or any other sources that you wish to compare
		in terms of gene expression.
