		Evolutionary and plasticity analysis of orthologous groups //
		Geneplast is designed for evolutionary and plasticity analysis
		based on orthologous groups distribution in a given species
		tree. It uses Shannon information theory and orthologs
		abundance to estimate the Evolutionary Plasticity Index.
		Additionally, it implements the Bridge algorithm to determine
		the evolutionary root of a given gene based on its orthologs
		distribution.
