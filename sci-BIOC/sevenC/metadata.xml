		Computational Chromosome Conformation Capture by Correlation of
		ChIP-seq at CTCF motifs // Chromatin looping is an essential
		feature of eukaryotic genomes and can bring regulatory
		sequences, such as enhancers or transcription factor binding
		sites, in the close physical proximity of regulated target
		genes. Here, we provide sevenC, an R package that uses protein
		binding signals from ChIP-seq and sequence motif information to
		predict chromatin looping events. Cross-linking of proteins
		that bind close to loop anchors result in ChIP-seq signals at
		both anchor loci. These signals are used at CTCF  motif pairs
		together with their distance and orientation to each other to
		predict whether they interact or not. The resulting chromatin
		loops might be used to associate enhancers or transcription
		factor binding sites (e.g., ChIP-seq peaks) to regulated target
		genes.
