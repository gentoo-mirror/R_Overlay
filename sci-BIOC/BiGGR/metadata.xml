		Constraint based modeling in R using metabolic reconstruction
		databases // This package provides an interface to simulate
		metabolic reconstruction from the BiGG
		database(http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) and other metabolic
		reconstruction databases. The package facilitates flux balance
		analysis (FBA) and the sampling of feasible flux distributions.
		Metabolic networks and estimated fluxes can be visualized with
		hypergraphs.
