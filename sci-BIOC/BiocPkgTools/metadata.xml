		Collection of simple tools for learning about Bioc Packages //
		Bioconductor has a rich ecosystem of metadata around packages,
		usage, and build status. This package is a simple collection of
		functions to access that metadata from R. The goal is to expose
		metadata for data mining and value-added functionality such as
		package searching, text mining, and analytics on packages.
