		Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample-Heterogeneity // EpiDISH is
		a R package to infer the proportions of a priori known cell-
		types present in a sample representing a mixture of such cell-
		types. Right now, the package can be used on DNAm data of whole
		blood, generic epithelial tissue and breast tissue. Besides,
		the package provides a function that allows the identification
		of differentially methylated cell-types and their
		directionality of change in Epigenome-Wide Association Studies.
