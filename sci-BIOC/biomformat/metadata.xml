		An interface package for the BIOM file format // This is an R
		package for interfacing with the BIOM format. This package
		includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing
		and subsetting data tables from a biom object (which is more
		complex than a single table), as well as limited support for
		writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file. The design of
		this API is intended to match the python API and other tools
		included with the biom-format project, but with a decidedly "R
		flavor" that should be familiar to R users. This includes S4
		classes and methods, as well as extensions of common core
		functions/methods.
