		Massive correlating biclusters for gene expression data and
		associated methods // Custom made algorithm and associated
		methods for finding, visualising and analysing biclusters in
		large gene expression data sets. Algorithm is based on with a
		supplied gene set of size n, finding the maximum strength
		correlation matrix containing m samples from the data set.
