		doseR // doseR package is a next generation sequencing package
		for sex chromosome dosage compensation which can be applied
		broadly to detect shifts in gene expression among an arbitrary
		number of pre-defined groups of loci. doseR is a differential
		gene expression package for count data, that detects
		directional shifts in expression for multiple, specific subsets
		of genes, broad utility in systems biology research. doseR has
		been prepared to manage the nature of the data and the desired
		set of inferences. doseR uses S4 classes to store count data
		from sequencing experiment. It contains functions to normalize
		and filter count data, as well as to plot and calculate
		statistics of count data. It contains a framework for linear
		modeling of count data. The package has been tested using real
		and simulated data.
