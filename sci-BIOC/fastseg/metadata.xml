		fastseg - a fast segmentation algorithm // fastseg implements a
		very fast and efficient segmentation algorithm. It has similar
		functionality as DNACopy (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004), but is
		considerably faster and more flexible. fastseg can segment data
		from DNA microarrays and data from next generation sequencing
		for example to detect copy number segments. Further it can
		segment data from RNA microarrays like tiling arrays to
		identify transcripts. Most generally, it can segment data given
		as a matrix or as a vector. Various data formats can be used as
		input to fastseg like expression set objects for microarrays or
		GRanges for sequencing data. The segmentation criterion of
		fastseg is based on a statistical test in a Bayesian framework,
		namely the cyber t-test (Baldi 2001). The speed-up arises from
		the facts, that sampling is not necessary in for fastseg and
		that a dynamic programming approach is used for calculation of
		the segments' first and higher order moments.
