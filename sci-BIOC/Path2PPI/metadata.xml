		Prediction of pathway-related protein-protein interaction
		networks // Package to predict protein-protein interaction
		(PPI) networks in target organisms for which only a view
		information about PPIs is available. Path2PPI predicts PPI
		networks based on sets of proteins which can belong to a
		certain pathway from well-established model organisms. It helps
		to combine and transfer information of a certain pathway or
		biological process from several reference organisms to one
		target organism. Path2PPI only depends on the sequence
		similarity of the involved proteins.
