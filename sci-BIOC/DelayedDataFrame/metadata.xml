		Delayed operation on DataFrame using standard DataFrame metaphor
		// Based on the standard DataFrame metaphor, we are trying to
		implement the feature of delayed operation on the
		DelayedDataFrame, with a slot of lazyIndex, which saves the
		mapping indexes for each column of DelayedDataFrame. Methods
		like show, validity check, [/[[ subsetting, rbind/cbind are
		implemented for DelayedDataFrame to be operated around
		lazyIndex. The listData slot stays untouched until a
		realization call e.g., DataFrame constructor OR as.list() is
		invoked.
