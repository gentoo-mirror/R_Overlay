		DEsingle for detecting three types of differential expression in
		single-cell RNA-seq data // DEsingle is an R package for
		differential expression (DE) analysis of single-cell RNA-seq
		(scRNA-seq) data. It defines and detects 3 types of
		differentially expressed genes between two groups of single
		cells, with regard to different expression status (DEs),
		differential expression abundance (DEa), and general
		differential expression (DEg). DEsingle employs Zero-Inflated
		Negative Binomial model to estimate the proportion of real and
		dropout zeros and to define and detect the 3 types of DE genes.
		Results showed that DEsingle outperforms existing methods for
		scRNA-seq DE analysis, and can reveal different types of DE
		genes that are enriched in different biological functions.
