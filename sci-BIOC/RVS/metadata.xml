		Computes estimates of the probability of related individuals
		sharing a rare variant // Rare Variant Sharing (RVS) implements
		tests of association and linkage between rare genetic variant
		genotypes and a dichotomous phenotype, e.g. a disease status,
		in family samples. The tests are based on probabilities of rare
		variant sharing by relatives under the null hypothesis of
		absence of linkage and association between the rare variants
		and the phenotype and apply to single variants or multiple
		variants in a region (e.g. gene-based test).
