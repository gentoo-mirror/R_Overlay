		Measuring the reproducibility of Hi-C data // Hi-C is a powerful
		technology for studying genome-wide chromatin interactions.
		However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data
		reproducibility can produce misleading results because they
		ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure
		and distance-dependence. We present a novel reproducibility
		measure that systematically takes these features into
		consideration. This measure can assess pairwise differences
		between Hi-C matrices under a wide range of settings, and can
		be used to determine optimal sequencing depth. Compared to
		existing approaches, it consistently shows higher accuracy in
		distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and
		depicting interrelationships of cell lineages than existing
		approaches. This R package `hicrep` implements our approach.
