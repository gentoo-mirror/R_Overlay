		Graphical User Interface for IsoCorrectoR // IsoCorrectoRGUI is a
		Graphical User Interface for the IsoCorrectoR package.
		IsoCorrectoR performs the correction of mass spectrometry data
		from stable isotope labeling/tracing metabolomics experiments
		with regard to natural isotope abundance and tracer impurity.
		Data from both MS and MS/MS measurements can be corrected (with
		any tracer isotope: 13C, 15N, 18O...), as well as high
		resolution MS data from multiple-tracer experiments (e.g. 13C
		and 15N used simultaneously).
