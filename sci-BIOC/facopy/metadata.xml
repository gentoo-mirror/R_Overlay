		Feature-based association and gene-set enrichment for copy number
		alteration analysis in cancer // facopy is an R package for
		fine-tuned cancer CNA association modeling. Association is
		measured directly at the genomic features of interest and, in
		the case of genes, downstream gene-set enrichment analysis can
		be performed thanks to novel internal processing of the data.
		The software opens a way to systematically scrutinize the
		differences in CNA distribution across tumoral phenotypes, such
		as those that relate to tumor type, location and progression.
		Currently, the output format from 11 different methods that
		analyze data from whole-genome/exome sequencing and SNP
		microarrays, is supported. Multiple genomes, alteration types
		and variable types are also supported.
