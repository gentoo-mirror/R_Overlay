		Multiple Beta t-Tests // MBttest method was developed from beta
		t-test method of Baggerly et al(2003). Compared to baySeq (Hard
		castle and Kelly 2010), DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010) and exact
		test (Robinson and Smyth 2007, 2008) and the GLM of McCarthy et
		al(2012), MBttest is of high work efficiency,that is, it has
		high power, high conservativeness of FDR estimation and high
		stability. MBttest is suit- able to transcriptomic data, tag
		data, SAGE data (count data) from small samples or a few
		replicate libraries. It can be used to identify genes, mRNA
		isoforms or tags differentially expressed between two
		conditions.
