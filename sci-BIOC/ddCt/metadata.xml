		The ddCt Algorithm for the Analysis of Quantitative Real-Time PCR
		(qRT-PCR) // The Delta-Delta-Ct (ddCt) Algorithm is an
		approximation method to determine relative gene expression with
		quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments. Compared to
		other approaches, it requires no standard curve for each
		primer-target pair, therefore reducing the working load and yet
		returning accurate enough results as long as the assumptions of
		the amplification efficiency hold. The ddCt package implements
		a pipeline to collect, analyse and visualize qRT-PCR results,
		for example those from TaqMan SDM software, mainly using the
		ddCt method. The pipeline can be either invoked by a script in
		command-line or through the API consisting of S4-Classes,
		methods and functions.
