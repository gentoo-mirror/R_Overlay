		GAPGOM (novel Gene Annotation Prediction and other GO Metrics) //
		Collection of various measures and tools for lncRNA annotation
		prediction put inside a redistributable R package. The package
		contains two main algorithms; lncRNA2GOA and TopoICSim.
		lncRNA2GOA tries to annotate novel genes (in this specific case
		lncRNAs) by using various correlation/geometric scoring methods
		on correlated expression data. After correlating/scoring, the
		results are annotated and enriched. TopoICSim is a
		topologically based method, that compares gene similarity based
		on the topology of the GO DAG by information content (IC)
		between GO terms.
