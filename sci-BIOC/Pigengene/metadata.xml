		Infers biological signatures from gene expression data //
		Pigengene package provides an efficient way to infer biological
		signatures from gene expression profiles. The signatures are
		independent from the underlying platform, e.g., the input can
		be microarray or RNA Seq data. It can even infer the signatures
		using data from one platform, and evaluate them on the other.
		Pigengene identifies the modules (clusters) of highly
		coexpressed genes using coexpression network analysis,
		summarizes the biological information of each module in an
		eigengene, learns a Bayesian network that models the
		probabilistic dependencies between modules, and builds a
		decision tree based on the expression of eigengenes.
