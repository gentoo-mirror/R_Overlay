		Gaussian Process Ranking and Estimation of Gene Expression time-
		series // The gprege package implements the methodology
		described in Kalaitzis  Lawrence (2011) "A simple approach to
		ranking differentially expressed gene expression time-courses
		through Gaussian process regression". The software fits two GPs
		with the an RBF (+ noise diagonal) kernel on each profile. One
		GP kernel is initialised wih a short lengthscale
		hyperparameter, signal variance as the observed variance and a
		zero noise variance. It is optimised via scaled conjugate
		gradients (netlab). A second GP has fixed hyperparameters: zero
		inverse-width, zero signal variance and noise variance as the
		observed variance. The log-ratio of marginal likelihoods of the
		two hypotheses acts as a score of differential expression for
		the profile. Comparison via ROC curves is performed against
		BATS (Angelini et.al, 2007). A detailed discussion of the
		ranking approach and dataset used can be found in the paper
		(http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/180).
