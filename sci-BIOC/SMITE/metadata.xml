		Significance-based Modules Integrating the Transcriptome and
		Epigenome // This package builds on the Epimods framework which
		facilitates finding weighted subnetworks ("modules") on
		Illumina Infinium 27k arrays using the SpinGlass algorithm, as
		implemented in the iGraph package. We have created a class of
		gene centric annotations associated with p-values and effect
		sizes and scores from any researchers prior statistical results
		to find functional modules.
