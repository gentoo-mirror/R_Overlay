		Statistical Inferences with MeDIP-seq Data (SIMD) to infer the
		methylation level for each CpG site // This package provides a
		inferential analysis method for detecting differentially
		expressed CpG sites in MeDIP-seq data. It uses statistical
		framework and EM algorithm, to identify differentially
		expressed CpG sites. The methods on this package are described
		in the article 'Methylation-level Inferences and Detection of
		Differential Methylation with Medip-seq Data' by Yan Zhou,
		Jiadi Zhu, Mingtao Zhao, Baoxue Zhang, Chunfu Jiang and Xiyan
		Yang (2018, pending publication).
