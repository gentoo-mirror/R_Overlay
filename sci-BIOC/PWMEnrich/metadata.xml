		PWM enrichment analysis // A toolkit of high-level functions for
		DNA motif scanning and enrichment analysis built upon
		Biostrings. The main functionality is PWM enrichment analysis
		of already known PWMs (e.g. from databases such as MotifDb),
		but the package also implements high-level functions for PWM
		scanning and visualisation. The package does not perform "de
		novo" motif discovery, but is instead focused on using motifs
		that are either experimentally derived or computationally
		constructed by other tools.
