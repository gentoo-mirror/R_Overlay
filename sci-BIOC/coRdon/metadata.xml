		Codon Usage Analysis and Prediction of Gene Expressivity // Tool
		for analysis of codon usage in various unannotated or KEGG/COG
		annotated DNA sequences. Calculates different measures of CU
		bias and CU-based predictors of gene expressivity, and performs
		gene set enrichment analysis for annotated sequences.
		Implements several methods for visualization of CU and
		enrichment analysis results.
