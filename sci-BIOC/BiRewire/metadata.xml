		High-performing routines for the randomization of a bipartite
		graph (or a binary event matrix), undirected and directed
		signed graph preserving degree distribution (or marginal
		totals) // Fast functions for bipartite network rewiring
		through N consecutive switching steps (See References) and for
		the computation of the minimal number of switching steps to be
		performed in order to maximise the dissimilarity with respect
		to the original network. Includes functions for the analysis of
		the introduced randomness across the switching steps and
		several other routines to analyse the resulting networks and
		their natural projections. Extension to undirected networks and
		directed signed networks is also provided. Starting from
		version 1.9.7 a more precise bound (especially for small
		network) has been implemented. Starting from version 2.2.0 the
		analysis routine is more complete and a visual montioring of
		the underlying Markov Chain has been implemented. Starting from
		3.6.0 the library can handle also matrices with NA (not for the
		directed signed graphs).
