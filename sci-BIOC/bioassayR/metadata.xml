		Cross-target analysis of small molecule bioactivity // bioassayR
		is a computational tool that enables simultaneous analysis of
		thousands of bioassay experiments performed over a diverse set
		of compounds and biological targets. Unique features include
		support for large-scale cross-target analyses of both public
		and custom bioassays, generation of high throughput screening
		fingerprints (HTSFPs), and an optional preloaded database that
		provides access to a substantial portion of publicly available
		bioactivity data.
