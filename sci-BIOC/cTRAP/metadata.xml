		Identification of candidate causal perturbations from
		differential gene expression data // Compare differential gene
		expression results with those from known cellular perturbations
		(such as gene knock-down, overexpression or small molecules)
		derived from the Connectivity Map. Such analyses allow not only
		to infer the molecular causes of the observed difference in
		gene expression but also to identify small molecules that could
		drive or revert specific transcriptomic alterations.
