		SynMut: Designing Synonymously Mutated Sequences with Different
		Genomic Signatures // There are increasing demands on designing
		virus mutants with specific dinucleotide or codon composition.
		This tool can take both dinucleotide preference and/or codon
		usage bias into account while designing mutants. It is a
		powerful tool for in silico designs of DNA sequence mutants.
