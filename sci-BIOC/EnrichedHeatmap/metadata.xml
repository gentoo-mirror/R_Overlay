		Making Enriched Heatmaps // Enriched heatmap is a special type of
		heatmap which visualizes the enrichment of genomic signals on
		specific target regions. Here we implement Enriched heatmap by
		ComplexHeatmap package. Since this type of heatmap is just a
		normal heatmap but with some special settings, with the
		functionality of ComplexHeatmap, it would be much easier to
		customize the heatmap as well as concatenating to a list of
		heatmaps to show correspondance between different data sources.
