		nanotatoR: next generation structural variant annotation and
		classification // Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has
		successfully been used to identify single-nucleotide variants
		(SNV), small insertions and deletions and, more recently, small
		copy number variants. However, due to utilization of short
		reads, it is not well suited for identification of structural
		variants (SV) and the majority of SV calling tools having high
		false positive and negative rates.Optical next-generation
		mapping (NGM) utilizes long fluorescently labeled native-state
		DNA molecules for de novo genome assembly to overcome the
		limitations of WGS. NGM allows for a significant increase in SV
		detection capability. However, accuracy of SV annotation is
		highly important for variant classification and filtration to
		determine pathogenicity.Here we create a new tool in R, for SV
		annotation, including population frequency and gene function
		and expression, using publicly available datasets. We use DGV
		(Database of Genomic Variants), to calculate the population
		frequency of the SVs identified by the Bionano SVCaller in the
		NGM dataset of a cohort of 50 undiagnosed patients with a
		variety of phenotypes. The new annotation tool, nanotatoR, also
		calculates the internal frequency of SVs, which could be
		beneficial in identification of potential false positive or
		common calls. The software creates a primary gene list (PG)
		from NCBI databases based on patient phenotype and compares the
		list to the set of genes overlapping the patients SVs generated
		by SVCaller, providing  analysts with an easy way to identify
		variants affecting genes  in the PG. The output is given in an
		Excel file format, which is subdivided into multiple sheets
		based on SV type. Users then have a choice to filter SVs using
		the provided annotation for identification of inherited, de
		novo or rare variants. nanotatoR  provides integrated
		annotation and the expression patterns to enable users to
		identify potential pathogenic SVs with greater precision and
		faster turnaround times.
