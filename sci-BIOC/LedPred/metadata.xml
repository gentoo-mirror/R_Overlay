		Learning from DNA to Predict Enhancers // This package aims at
		creating a predictive model of regulatory sequences used to
		score unknown sequences based on the content of DNA motifs,
		next-generation sequencing (NGS) peaks and signals and other
		numerical scores of the sequences using supervised
		classification. The package contains a workflow based on the
		support vector machine (SVM) algorithm that maps features to
		sequences, optimize SVM parameters and feature number and
		creates a model that can be stored and used to score the
		regulatory potential of unknown sequences.
