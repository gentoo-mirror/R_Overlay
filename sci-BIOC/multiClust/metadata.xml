		multiClust: An R-package for Identifying Biologically Relevant
		Clusters in Cancer Transcriptome Profiles // Clustering is
		carried out to identify patterns in transcriptomics profiles to
		determine clinically relevant subgroups of patients. Feature
		(gene) selection is a critical and an integral part of the
		process. Currently, there are many feature selection and
		clustering methods to identify the relevant genes and perform
		clustering of samples. However, choosing an appropriate
		methodology is difficult. In addition, extensive feature
		selection methods have not been supported by the available
		packages. Hence, we developed an integrative R-package called
		multiClust that allows researchers to experiment with the
		choice of combination of methods for gene selection and
		clustering with ease. Using multiClust, we identified the best
		performing clustering methodology in the context of clinical
		outcome. Our observations demonstrate that simple methods such
		as variance-based ranking perform well on the majority of data
		sets, provided that the appropriate number of genes is
		selected. However, different gene ranking and selection methods
		remain relevant as no methodology works for all studies.
