		Processing and Analysis of Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Arrays
		including Exon Arrays, Whole Genome Arrays and Plate Arrays //
		The package handles pre-processing, normalization, filtering
		and analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip expression arrays,
		including exon arrays (Exon 1.0 ST: core, extended, full
		probesets), gene arrays (Gene 1.0 ST) and plate arrays on
		computers with 1 GB RAM only. It imports Affymetrix .CDF, .CLF,
		.PGF and .CEL as well as annotation files, and computes e.g.
		RMA, MAS5, FARMS, DFW, FIRMA, tRMA, MAS5-calls, DABG-calls,
		I/NI-calls. It is an R wrapper to XPS (eXpression Profiling
		System), which is based on ROOT, an object-oriented framework
		developed at CERN. Thus, the prior installation of ROOT is a
		prerequisite for the usage of this package, however, no
		knowledge of ROOT is required. ROOT is licensed under LGPL and
		can be downloaded from http://root.cern.ch.
