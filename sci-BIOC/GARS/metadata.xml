		GARS: Genetic Algorithm for the identification of Robust Subsets
		of variables in high-dimensional and challenging datasets //
		Feature selection aims to identify and remove redundant,
		irrelevant and noisy variables from high-dimensional datasets.
		Selecting informative features affects the subsequent
		classification and regression analyses by improving their
		overall performances. Several methods have been proposed to
		perform feature selection: most of them relies on univariate
		statistics, correlation, entropy measurements or the usage of
		backward/forward regressions. Herein, we propose an efficient,
		robust and fast method that adopts stochastic optimization
		approaches for high-dimensional. GARS is an innovative
		implementation of a  genetic algorithm that selects robust
		features in high-dimensional and challenging datasets.
