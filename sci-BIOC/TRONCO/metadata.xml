		TRONCO, an R package for TRanslational ONCOlogy // The TRONCO
		(TRanslational ONCOlogy) R package collects algorithms to infer
		progression models via the approach of Suppes-Bayes Causal
		Network, both from an ensemble of tumors (cross-sectional
		samples) and within an individual patient (multi-region or
		single-cell samples). The package provides parallel
		implementation of algorithms that process binary matrices where
		each row represents a tumor sample and each column a single-
		nucleotide or a structural variant driving the  progression; a
		0/1 value models the absence/presence of that alteration in the
		sample. The tool can import data from plain, MAF or GISTIC
		format files, and can fetch it from the cBioPortal for cancer
		genomics. Functions for  data manipulation and visualization
		are provided, as well as functions to import/export such data
		to other bioinformatics  tools for, e.g, clustering or
		detection of mutually exclusive alterations. Inferred models
		can be visualized and tested for their confidence via bootstrap
		and cross-validation. TRONCO is used for  the implementation of
		the Pipeline for Cancer Inference (PICNIC).
