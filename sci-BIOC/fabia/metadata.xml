		FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition // Biclustering
		by "Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition" (FABIA). FABIA
		is a model-based technique for biclustering, that is clustering
		rows and columns simultaneously. Biclusters are found by factor
		analysis where both the factors and the loading matrix are
		sparse. FABIA is a multiplicative model that extracts linear
		dependencies between samples and feature patterns. It captures
		realistic non-Gaussian data distributions with heavy tails as
		observed in gene expression measurements. FABIA utilizes well
		understood model selection techniques like the EM algorithm and
		variational approaches and is embedded into a Bayesian
		framework. FABIA ranks biclusters according to their
		information content and separates spurious biclusters from true
		biclusters. The code is written in C.
