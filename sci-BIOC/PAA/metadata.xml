		PAA (Protein Array Analyzer) // PAA imports single color
		(protein) microarray data that has been saved in gpr file
		format - esp. ProtoArray data. After pre-processing (background
		correction, batch filtering, normalization) univariate feature
		pre-selection is performed (e.g., using the "minimum M
		statistic" approach - hereinafter referred to as "mMs").
		Subsequently, a multivariate feature selection is conducted to
		discover biomarker candidates. Therefore, either a frequency-
		based backwards elimination aproach or ensemble feature
		selection can be used. PAA provides a complete toolbox of
		analysis tools including several different plots for results
		examination and evaluation.
