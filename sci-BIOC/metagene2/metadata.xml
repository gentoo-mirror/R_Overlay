		A package to produce metagene plots // This package produces
		metagene plots to compare coverages of sequencing experiments
		at selected groups of genomic regions. It can be used for such
		analyses as assessing the binding of DNA-interacting proteins
		at promoter regions or surveying antisense transcription over
		the length of a gene. The metagene2 package can manage all
		aspects of the analysis, from normalization of coverages to
		plot facetting according to experimental metadata. Bootstraping
		analysis is used to provide confidence intervals of per-sample
		mean coverages.
