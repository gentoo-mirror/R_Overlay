		Two-sample tests on a graph // DEGraph implements recent
		hypothesis testing methods which directly assess whether a
		particular gene network is differentially expressed between two
		conditions. This is to be contrasted with the more classical
		two-step approaches which first test individual genes, then
		test gene sets for enrichment in differentially expressed
		genes. These recent methods take into account the topology of
		the network to yield more powerful detection procedures.
		DEGraph provides methods to easily test all KEGG pathways for
		differential expression on any gene expression data set and
		tools to visualize the results.
