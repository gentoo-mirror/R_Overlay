		co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis // cogena is a workflow
		for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis. It aims to
		discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events
		that may be of great biological relevance. A novel pipeline for
		drug discovery and drug repositioning based on the cogena
		workflow is proposed. Particularly, candidate drugs can be
		predicted based on the gene expression of disease-related data,
		or other similar drugs can be identified based on the gene
		expression of drug-related data. Moreover, the drug mode of
		action can be disclosed by the associated pathway analysis. In
		summary, cogena is a flexible workflow for various gene set
		enrichment analysis for co-expressed genes, with a focus on
		pathway/GO analysis and drug repositioning.
