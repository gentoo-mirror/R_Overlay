		Annotation-agnostic differential expression analysis of RNA-seq
		data at base-pair resolution via the DER Finder approach //
		This package provides functions for annotation-agnostic
		differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. Two
		implementations of the DER Finder approach are included in this
		package: (1) single base-level F-statistics and (2) DER
		identification at the expressed regions-level. The DER Finder
		approach can also be used to identify differentially bounded
		ChIP-seq peaks.
