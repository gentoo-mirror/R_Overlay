		Stability and Aggregation of ranked gene lists // The term
		'GeneSelector' refers to a filter selecting those genes which
		are consistently identified as differentially expressed using
		various statistical procedures. 'Selected' genes are those
		present at the top of the list in various ranking methods
		(currently 14). In addition, the stability of the findings can
		be taken into account in the final ranking by examining
		perturbed versions of the original data set, e.g. by leaving
		samples, swapping class labels, generating bootstrap replicates
		or adding noise. Given multiple ranked lists, one can use
		aggregation methods in order to find a synthesis.
