		Inferring metabolic networks from untargeted high-resolution mass
		spectrometry data // MetNet contains functionality to infer
		metabolic network topologies from quantitative data and high-
		resolution mass/charge information. Using statistical models
		(including correlation, mutual information, regression and
		Bayes statistics) and quantitative data (intensity values of
		features) adjacency matrices are inferred that can be combined
		to a consensus matrix. Mass differences calculated between
		mass/charge values of features will be matched against a data
		frame of supplied mass/charge differences referring to
		transformations of enzymatic activities. In a third step, the
		two matrices are combined to form a adjacency matrix inferred
		from both quantitative and structure information.
