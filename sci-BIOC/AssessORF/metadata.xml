		Assess Gene Predictions Using Proteomics and Evolutionary
		Conservation // In order to assess the quality of a set of
		predicted genes for a genome, evidence must first be mapped to
		that genome. Next, each gene must be categorized based on how
		strong the evidence is for or against that gene. The AssessORF
		package provides the functions and class structures necessary
		for accomplishing those tasks, using proteomic hits and
		evolutionarily conserved start codons as the forms of evidence.
