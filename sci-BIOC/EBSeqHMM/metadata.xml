		Bayesian analysis for identifying gene or isoform expression
		changes in ordered RNA-seq experiments // The EBSeqHMM package
		implements an auto-regressive hidden Markov model for
		statistical analysis in ordered RNA-seq experiments (e.g. time
		course or spatial course data). The EBSeqHMM package provides
		functions to identify genes and isoforms that have non-constant
		expression profile over the time points/positions, and cluster
		them into expression paths.
