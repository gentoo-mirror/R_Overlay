		Outlier detection in multiple sequence alignments // Performs
		outlier detection of sequences in a multiple sequence alignment
		using bootstrap of predefined distance metrics. Outlier
		sequences can make downstream analyses unreliable or make the
		alignments less accurate while they are being constructed. This
		package implements the OD-seq algorithm proposed by Jehl et al
		(doi 10.1186/s12859-015-0702-1) for aligned sequences and a
		variant using string kernels for unaligned sequences.
