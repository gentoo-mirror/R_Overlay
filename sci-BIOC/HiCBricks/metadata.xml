		Framework for Storing and Accessing Hi-C Data Through HDF Files
		// A flexible framework for storing and accessing high-
		resolution Hi-C data through HDF files. HiCBricks allows import
		of Hi-C data through various formats such as the 2D matrix
		format or a generalized n-column table formats. In terms of
		access, HiCBricks offers functions to retrieve values from
		genomic loci separated by a certain distance, or the ability to
		fetch matrix subsets using word alike terms. HiCBricks will at
		a later point offer the ability to fetch multiple matrix
		subsets using fewer calls. It offers the capacity to store
		GenomicRanges that may be associated to a particular Hi-C
		experiment, to do basic ranges overlap (any, within) with the
		Hi-C experiment associated Ranges object and also to store any
		metadata that users may think to be relevant for their Hi-C
		experiment. Finally, you can do TAD calls with LSD and create
		pretty heatmaps.
