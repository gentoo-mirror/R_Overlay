		Classes and methods for performing benchmark comparisons // This
		package defines the BenchDesign and SummarizedBenchmark classes
		for building, executing, and evaluating benchmark experiments
		of computational methods. The SummarizedBenchmark class extends
		the RangedSummarizedExperiment object, and is designed to
		provide infrastructure to store and compare the results of
		applying different methods to a shared data set. This class
		provides an integrated interface to store metadata such as
		method parameters and software versions as well as ground
		truths (when these are available) and evaluation metrics.
