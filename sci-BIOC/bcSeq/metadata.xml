		Fast Sequence Mapping in High-Throughput shRNA and CRISPR Screens
		// This Rcpp-based package implements a highly efficient data
		structure and algorithm for performing alignment of short reads
		from CRISPR or shRNA screens to reference barcode library.
		Sequencing error are considered and matching qualities are
		evaluated based on Phred scores. A Bayes' classifier is
		employed to predict the originating barcode of a read. The
		package supports provision of user-defined probability models
		for evaluating matching qualities. The package also supports
		multi-threading.
