		Interval-Wise Testing for Omics Data // Implementation of the
		Interval-Wise Testing (IWT) for omics data. This inferential
		procedure tests for differences in "Omics" data between two
		groups of genomic regions (or between a group of genomic
		regions and a reference center of symmetry), and does not
		require fixing location and scale at the outset.
