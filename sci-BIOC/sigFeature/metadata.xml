		sigFeature: Significant feature selection using SVM-RFE
		t-statistic // This package provides a novel feature selection
		algorithm for binary classification using support vector
		machine recursive feature elimination SVM-RFE and t-statistic.
		In this feature selection process, the selected features are
		differentially significant between the two classes and also
		they are good classifier with higher degree of classification
		accuracy.
