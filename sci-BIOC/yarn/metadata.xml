		YARN: Robust Multi-Condition RNA-Seq Preprocessing and
		Normalization // Expedite large RNA-Seq analyses using a
		combination of previously developed tools. YARN is meant to
		make it easier for the user in performing basic mis-annotation
		quality control, filtering, and condition-aware normalization.
		YARN leverages many Bioconductor tools and statistical
		techniques to account for the large heterogeneity and sparsity
		found in very large RNA-seq experiments.
