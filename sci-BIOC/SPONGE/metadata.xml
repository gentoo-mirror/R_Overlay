		Sparse Partial Correlations On Gene Expression // This package
		provides methods to efficiently detect competitive endogeneous
		RNA interactions between two genes. Such interactions are
		mediated by one or several miRNAs such that both gene and miRNA
		expression data for a larger number of samples is needed as
		input.
