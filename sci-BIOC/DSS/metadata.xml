		Dispersion shrinakge for sequencing data. // DSS is an R library
		performing differntial analysis for count-based sequencing
		data. It detectes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from
		RNA-seq, and differentially methylated loci or regions
		(DML/DMRs) from bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). The core of DSS
		is a new dispersion shrinkage method for estimating the
		dispersion parameter from Gamma-Poisson or Beta-Binomial
		distributions.
