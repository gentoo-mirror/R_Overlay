		Identification of potential quadruplex forming sequences //
		Pqsfinder detects DNA sequence patterns that are likely to fold
		into an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4). Unlike many other
		approaches, pqsfinder is able to detect G4s folded from
		imperfect G-runs containing bulges or mismatches or G4s having
		long loops. Pqsfinder also assigns an integer score to each hit
		that was fitted on G4 sequencing data and corresponds to
		expected stability of the folded G4.
