		Foundation of integer range manipulation in Bioconductor //
		Provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4 classes for
		storing, manipulating and aggregating over annotated ranges of
		integers. Implements an algebra of range operations, including
		efficient algorithms for finding overlaps and nearest
		neighbors. Defines efficient list-like classes for storing,
		transforming and aggregating large grouped data, i.e.,
		collections of atomic vectors and DataFrames.
