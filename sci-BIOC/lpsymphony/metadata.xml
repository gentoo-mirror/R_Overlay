		Symphony integer linear programming solver in R // This package
		was derived from Rsymphony_0.1-17 from CRAN. These packages
		provide an R interface to SYMPHONY, an open-source linear
		programming solver written in C++. The main difference between
		this package and Rsymphony is that it includes the solver
		source code (SYMPHONY version 5.6), while Rsymphony expects to
		find header and library files on the users' system. Thus the
		intention of lpsymphony is to provide an easy to install
		interface to SYMPHONY. For Windows, precompiled DLLs are
		included in this package.
