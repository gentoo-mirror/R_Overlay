		R package for RIVER (RNA-Informed Variant Effect on Regulation)
		// An implementation of a probabilistic modeling framework that
		jointly analyzes personal genome and transcriptome data to
		estimate the probability that a variant has regulatory impact
		in that individual. It is based on a generative model that
		assumes that genomic annotations, such as the location of a
		variant with respect to regulatory elements, determine the
		prior probability that variant is a functional regulatory
		variant, which is an unobserved variable. The functional
		regulatory variant status then influences whether nearby genes
		are likely to display outlier levels of gene expression in that
		person. See the RIVER website for more information,
		documentation and examples.
