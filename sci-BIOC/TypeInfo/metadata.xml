		Optional Type Specification Prototype // A prototype for a
		mechanism for specifying the types of parameters and the return
		value for an R function. This is meta-information that can be
		used to generate stubs for servers and various interfaces to
		these functions. Additionally, the arguments in a call to a
		typed function can be validated using the type specifications.
		We allow types to be specified as either i) by class name using
		either inheritance -  is(x, className), or strict instance of -
		class(x) %in% className, or ii) a dynamic test given as an R
		expression which is evaluated at run-time. More precise
		information and interesting tests can be done via ii), but it
		is harder to use this information as meta-data as it requires
		more effort to interpret it and it is of course run-time
		information. It is typically more meaningful.
