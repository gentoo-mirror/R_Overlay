		Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data // Single-cell
		mRNA sequencing can uncover novel cell-to-cell heterogeneity in
		gene expression levels in seemingly homogeneous populations of
		cells. However, these experiments are prone to high levels of
		technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying genes
		that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the
		population of cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of
		Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian
		hierarchical model to perform statistical analyses of single-
		cell RNA sequencing datasets in the context of supervised
		experiments (where the groups of cells of interest are known a
		priori, e.g. experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS
		performs built-in data normalisation (global scaling) and
		technical noise quantification (based on spike-in genes).
		BASiCS provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly (or
		lowly) variable genes within a single group of cells.
		Additionally, BASiCS can compare gene expression patterns
		between two or more pre-specified groups of cells. Unlike
		traditional differential expression tools, BASiCS quantifies
		changes in expression that lie beyond comparisons of means,
		also allowing the study of changes in cell-to-cell
		heterogeneity. The latter can be quantified via a biological
		over-dispersion parameter that measures the excess of
		variability that is observed with respect to Poisson sampling
		noise, after normalisation and technical noise removal. Due to
		the strong mean/over-dispersion confounding that is typically
		observed for scRNA-seq datasets, BASiCS also tests for changes
		in residual over-dispersion, defined by residual values with
		respect to a global mean/over-dispersion trend.
