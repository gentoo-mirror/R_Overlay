		Visual Exploration of Omic Datasets Using a Shiny App // A Shiny
		app for visual exploration of omic datasets as compositions,
		and differential abundance analysis using ALDEx2. Useful for
		exploring RNA-seq, meta-RNA-seq, 16s rRNA gene sequencing with
		visualizations such as principal component analysis biplots
		(coloured using metadata for visualizing each variable),
		dendrograms and stacked bar plots, and effect plots (ALDEx2).
		Input is a table of counts and metadata file (if metadata
		exists), with options to filter data by count or by metadata to
		remove low counts, or to visualize select samples according to
		selected metadata.
