		MethylMix: Identifying methylation driven cancer genes //
		MethylMix is an algorithm implemented to identify hyper and
		hypomethylated genes for a disease. MethylMix is based on a
		beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares
		them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix uses a
		novel statistic, the Differential Methylation value or DM-value
		defined as the difference of a methylation state with the
		normal methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data
		is used to identify, besides differential, functional
		methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that
		effect gene expression. References: Gevaert 0. MethylMix: an R
		package for identifying DNA methylation-driven genes.
