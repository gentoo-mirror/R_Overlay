		Automatic Statistical Identification in Complex Spectra // With a
		set of pure metabolite reference spectra, ASICS quantifies
		concentration of metabolites in a complex spectrum. The
		identification of metabolites is performed by fitting a mixture
		model to the spectra of the library with a sparse penalty. The
		method and its statistical properties are described in Tardivel
		et al. (2017) doi:10.1007/s11306-017-1244-5.
