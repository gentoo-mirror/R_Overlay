		R Interface to CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) Files //
		This package provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray
		Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files, which are portable
		across platforms with hierarchical structure to store multiple
		scalable array-oriented data sets with metadata information. It
		is suited for large-scale datasets, especially for data which
		are much larger than the available random-access memory. The
		gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations specifically
		designed for integers of less than 8 bits, since a diploid
		genotype, like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), usually
		occupies fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and
		decompression are available with relatively efficient random
		access. It is also allowed to read a GDS file in parallel with
		multiple R processes supported by the package parallel.
