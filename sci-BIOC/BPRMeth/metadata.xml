		Model higher-order methylation profiles // The BPRMeth package is
		a probabilistic method to quantify explicit features of
		methylation profiles, in a way that would make it easier to
		formally use such profiles in downstream modelling efforts,
		such as predicting gene expression levels or clustering genomic
		regions or cells according to their methylation profiles.
