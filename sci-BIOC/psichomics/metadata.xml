		Graphical Interface for Alternative Splicing Quantification,
		Analysis and Visualisation // Interactive R package with an
		intuitive Shiny-based graphical interface for alternative
		splicing quantification and integrative analyses of alternative
		splicing and gene expression based on The Cancer Genome Atlas
		(TCGA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx), Sequence
		Read Archive (SRA) and user-provided data. The tool
		interactively performs survival, dimensionality reduction and
		median- and variance-based differential splicing and gene
		expression analyses that benefit from the incorporation of
		clinical and molecular sample-associated features (such as
		tumour stage or survival). Interactive visual access to genomic
		mapping and functional annotation of selected alternative
		splicing events is also included.
