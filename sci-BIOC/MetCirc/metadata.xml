		Navigating mass spectral similarity in high-resolution MS/MS
		metabolomics data // MetCirc comprises a workflow to
		interactively explore high-resolution MS/MS metabolomics data:
		create an MSP object, a format for MS/MS library data, bin m/z
		values of precursors, calculate similarity between precursors
		based on the normalised dot product and visualise similarities
		in a circular layout. Within the interactive framework the user
		can annotate MS/MS features based on their similarity to
		(known) related MS/MS features.
