		Construct Benchmarks for Single Cell Analysis Methods // This
		package contains infrastructure for benchmarking analysis
		methods and access to single cell mixture benchmarking data. It
		provides a framework for organising analysis methods and
		testing combinations of methods in a pipeline without
		explicitly laying out each combination. It also provides
		utilities for sampling and filtering SingleCellExperiment
		objects, constructing lists of functions with varying
		parameters, and multithreaded evaluation of analysis methods.
