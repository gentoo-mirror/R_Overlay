		Divergence: Functionality for assessing omics data by divergence
		with respect to a baseline // This package provides
		functionality for performing divergence analysis as presented
		in Dinalankara et al, "Digitizing omics profiles by divergence
		from a baseline", PANS 2018. This allows the user to simplify
		high dimensional omics data into a binary or ternary format
		which encapsulates how the data is divergent from a specified
		baseline group with the same univariate or multivariate
		features.
