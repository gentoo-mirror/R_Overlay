		Survival analysis using transcriptional networks inferred by the
		RTN package // RTNsurvival is a tool for integrating regulons
		generated by the RTN package with survival information. For a
		given regulon, the 2-tailed GSEA approach computes a
		differential Enrichment Score (dES) for each individual sample,
		and the dES distribution of all samples is then used to assess
		the survival statistics for the cohort. There are two main
		survival analysis workflows: a Cox Proportional Hazards
		approach used to model regulons as predictors of survival time,
		and a Kaplan-Meier analysis assessing the stratification of a
		cohort based on the regulon activity. All plots can be fine-
		tuned to the user's specifications.
