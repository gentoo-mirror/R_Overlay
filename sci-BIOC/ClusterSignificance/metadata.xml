		ClusterSignificance package provides tools to assess if class
		clusters in dimensionality reduced data representations have a
		separation different from permuted data. The term class
		clusters here refers to, clusters of points representing known
		classes in the data. This is particularly useful to determine
		if a subset of the variables, e.g. genes in a specific pathway,
		alone can separate samples into these established classes.
		ClusterSignificance accomplishes this by, projecting all points
		onto a one dimensional line. Cluster separations are then
		scored and the probability of the seen separation being due to
		chance is evaluated using a permutation method.
