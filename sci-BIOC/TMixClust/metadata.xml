		Time Series Clustering of Gene Expression with Gaussian Mixed-
		Effects Models and Smoothing Splines // Implementation of a
		clustering method for time series gene expression data based on
		mixed-effects models with Gaussian variables and non-parametric
		cubic splines estimation. The method can robustly account for
		the high levels of noise present in typical gene expression
		time series datasets.
