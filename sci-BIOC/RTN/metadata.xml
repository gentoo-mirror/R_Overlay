		RTN: Reconstruction of Transcriptional regulatory Networks and
		analysis of regulons // A transcriptional regulatory network
		(TRN) consists of a collection of transcription factors (TFs)
		and the regulated target genes. TFs are regulators that
		recognize specific DNA sequences and guide the expression of
		the genome, either activating or repressing the expression the
		target genes. The set of genes controlled by the same TF forms
		a regulon. This package provides classes and methods for the
		reconstruction of TRNs and analysis of regulons.
