		Automated Evaluation of Precursor Ion Purity for Mass
		Spectrometry Based Fragmentation in Metabolomics // msPurity R
		package was developed to: 1) Assess the spectral quality of
		fragmentation spectra by evaluating the "precursor ion purity".
		2) Process fragmentation spectra. 3) Perform spectral matching.
		What is precursor ion purity? -What we call "Precursor ion
		purity" is a measure of the contribution of a selected
		precursor peak in an isolation window used for fragmentation.
		The simple calculation involves dividing the intensity of the
		selected precursor peak by the total intensity of the isolation
		window. When assessing MS/MS spectra this calculation is done
		before and after the MS/MS scan of interest and the purity is
		interpolated at the recorded time of the MS/MS acquisition.
		Additionally, isotopic peaks can be removed, low abundance
		peaks are removed that are thought to have limited contribution
		to the resulting MS/MS spectra and the isolation efficiency of
		the mass spectrometer can be used to normalise the intensities
		used for the calculation.
