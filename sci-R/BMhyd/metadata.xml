		PCM for Hybridization // The BMhyd package analyzes the
		phenotypic evolution of species of hybrid origin on a
		phylogenetic network. This package can detect the hybrid vigor
		effect, a burst of variation at formation, and the relative
		portion of heritability from its parents. Parameters are
		estimated by maximum likelihood technique. Users need to enter
		comparative data set and phylogenetic networks in eNewick
		format. The full model contains five parameters: the overall
		mean, the overall variance, the hybrid vigor, the hybrid
		variation and the proportion of heritability. We report four
		different models. All fix the heritability to equal
		contributions from each parent. Model 1 fixes the hybrid vigor
		and burst of variation at formation at 1 and 0; respectively.
		Model 2 fixes the hybrid vigor at 1 but allow the burst of
		variation at formation to vary; model 3 allows hybrid vigor to
		vary but fixes burst of variation at origin; and model 4 allows
		both to vary. Those models are compared under sample size
		correction Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). The model
		averaged parameter estimates are reported.
