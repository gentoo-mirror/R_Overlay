		Time Series Database Interface // TSdbi provides a common
		interface to time series databases. The objective is to define
		a standard interface so users can retrieve time series data
		from various sources with a simple, common, set of commands,
		and so programs can be written to be portable with respect to
		the data source. The SQL implementations also provide a
		database table design, so users needing to set up a time series
		database have a reasonably complete way to do this easily. The
		interface provides for a variety of options with respect to the
		representation of time series in R. The interface, and the SQL
		implementations, also handle vintages of time series data
		(sometime called editions or realtime data). There is also a
		(not yet well tested) mechanism to handle multilingual data
		documentation. Comprehensive examples of all the TS* packages
		is provided in the vignette Guide.pdf with the TSdata package.
