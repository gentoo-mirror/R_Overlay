		A pedagogical tool to teach the basics of coalescent theory //
		Coalescent theory provides a powerful modeling tool for
		population genetics. It is based on a genealogical
		interpretation of the history of gene lineages in populations.
		Although classical population genetics theory considers the
		evolution of gene lineages forward in time, coalescent theory
		considers the genealogical history of a sample of genes,
		looking backward in time. In the absence of selection (i.e., if
		all genetic variants are selectively neutral), then the
		mutation process can be decoupled from the genealogical
		process. Therefore, selectively neutral mutations can then be
		superimposed on the genealogical history. This package is
		intended to  provide a pedagogical tool to teach the basics of
		coalescent theory. It enables to simulate gene genealogies in
		an  isolated population of constant effective size, or in a
		population that changed in size some generations in the past.
		Gene genealogies can be constructed using a continuous time
		approximation, or a generation-by-generation
		algorithm.Graphical outputs show the consequence of population
		size changes on the shape of genealogies. Mutations can then be
		added on the gene genealogies, and summary statistics (e.g.,
		heterozygosity, number of alleles) can be computed from gene
		histories.
