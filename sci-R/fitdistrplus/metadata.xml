		Help to Fit of a Parametric Distribution to Non-Censored or
		Censored Data // Extends the fitdistr function (of the MASS
		package) with several functions to help the fit of a parametric
		distribution to non-censored or censored data. Censored data
		may contain left censored, right censored and interval censored
		values, with several lower and upper bounds. In addition to
		maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the package provides
		moment matching (MME), quantile matching (QME) and maximum
		goodness-of-fit estimation (MGE) methods (available only for
		non-censored data). Weighted versions of MLE, MME and QME are
		available.
