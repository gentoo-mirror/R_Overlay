		Foreach looping construct for R // Support for the foreach
		looping construct.  Foreach is an idiom that allows for
		iterating over elements in a collection, without the use of an
		explicit loop counter.  This package in particular is intended
		to be used for its return value, rather than for its side
		effects.  In that sense, it is similar to the standard lapply
		function, but doesn't require the evaluation of a function.
		Using foreach without side effects also facilitates executing
		the loop in parallel.
