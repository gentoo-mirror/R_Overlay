		Functions for Optimal Non-bipartite Matching // This package
		provides functions for performing nonbipartite matching and
		matched randomization. A "bipartite" matching utilizes two
		separate groups, e.g. smokers being matched to nonsmokers or
		cases being matched to controls. A "nonbipartite" matching
		creates mates from one big group, e.g. 100 hospitals being
		randomized for a two-arm cluster randomized trial or 5000
		children who have been exposed to various levels of secondhand
		smoke and are being paired to form a greater exposure vs.
		lesser exposure comparison. At the core of a nonbipartite
		matching is a NxN distance matrix for N potential mates. The
		distance between two units expresses a measure of similarity or
		quality as mates (the lower the better). The 'gendistance()'
		and 'distancematrix()' functions assist in creating this. The
		'nonbimatch()' function creates the matching that minimizes the
		total sum of distances between mates; hence, it is referred to
		as an "optimal" matching. The 'assign.grp()' function aids in
		performing a matched randomization. Note the package can also
		perform bipartite matching using the prevent option in
		'gendistance()'.
