		Functions Ported From MMR2 Toolbox Offered in Kevin Dowd's Book
		Measuring Market Risk // Kevin Dowd's book Measuring Market
		Risk is a widely read book in the area of risk measurement and
		is widely used by students and practitioners alike. As he
		claims, MATLAB indeed might have been most suitable language
		when Dowd originally wrote the functions, however, with growing
		popularity of R and a large user base, this project should make
		Dowd's code accessible to more readers. As Dowd's code was not
		intended to be error free and were more for reference, some
		functions in this package have inherited those errors. An
		attempt will be made in future to identify and correct them.
		Dowd's original code can be downloaded from . It should be
		noted that Dowd offers both MMR2 and MMR1 toolboxes. Only MMR2
		was ported to R. MMR2 is more recent version of MMR1 toolbox
		and they both have mostly similar function. The toolbox mainly
		contains different parametric and non parametric methods for
		measurement of market risk as well as backtesting risk
		measurement methods.
