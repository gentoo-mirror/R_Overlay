		Visualizing Generalized Canonical Discriminant and Canonical
		Correlation Analysis // Functions for computing and visualizing
		generalized canonical discriminant analyses and canonical
		correlation analysis for a multivariate linear model.
		Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a
		one-way 'MANOVA' design and is equivalent to canonical
		correlation analysis between a set of quantitative response
		variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor
		variable. The 'candisc' package generalizes this to higher-way
		'MANOVA' designs for all factors in a multivariate linear
		model, computing canonical scores and vectors for each term.
		The graphic functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D)
		visualizations of terms in an 'mlm' via the 'plot.candisc' and
		'heplot.candisc' methods. Related plots are now provided for
		canonical correlation analysis when all predictors are
		quantitative.
