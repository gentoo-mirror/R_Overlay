		Person Fit // Several person-fit statistics (PFSs) are offered.
		These statistics allow assessing whether individual response
		patterns to tests or questionnaires are (im)plausible given the
		other respondents in the sample or given a specified item
		response theory model. Some PFSs apply to dichotomous data,
		such as the likelihood-based PFSs (lz, lz*) and the group-based
		PFSs (personal biserial correlation, caution index, (normed)
		number of Guttman errors, agreement/disagreement/dependability
		statistics, U3, ZU3, NCI, Ht). PFSs suitable to polytomous data
		include extensions of lz, U3, and (normed) number of Guttman
		errors.
