		Model-Based Clustering for Multivariate Partial Ranking Data //
		Implementation of a model-based clustering algorithm for
		ranking data. Multivariate rankings as well as partial rankings
		are taken into account. This algorithm is based on an extension
		of the Insertion Sorting Rank (ISR) model for ranking data,
		which is a meaningful and effective model parametrized by a
		position parameter (the modal ranking, quoted by mu) and a
		dispersion parameter (quoted by pi). The heterogeneity of the
		rank population is modelled by a mixture of ISR, whereas
		conditional independence assumption is considered for
		multivariate rankings.
