		A Toolkit for Recursive Partytioning // A toolkit with
		infrastructure for representing, summarizing, and visualizing
		tree-structured regression and classification models. This
		unified infrastructure can be used for reading/coercing tree
		models from different sources (`rpart', `RWeka', `PMML')
		yielding objects that share functionality for
		print()/plot()/predict() methods. Furthermore, new and improved
		reimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and
		model-based recursive partitioning (mob()) from the `party'
		package are provided based on the new infrastructure.
