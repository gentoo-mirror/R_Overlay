		Measuring content and relational of (political) debates //
		Several dimensions are in play during a debate. This is
		especially the case for political debates. This package
		provides tools for measuring both the content and the
		relational dynamics of debates. For measuring content we
		suggest to use a thematic coding based on a dictionary. From
		this dictionary, the list of the actors of the debate, and the
		memorials in PDF files, the package can help you to count
		occurences of dictionnary items in each actor speechs. The
		relational is measured by count approval, disapproval and
		neutral references between actors. Using the spnet package as a
		back-end for the visualization, the user can display both the
		content and the relational aspects of the debate on the
		assembly map. See (ARTICLE) for more information about this
		methodology.
