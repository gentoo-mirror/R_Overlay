		The hyperbolic distribution // This package is no longer being
		maintained. It has been superseded by GeneralizedHyperbolic.
		GeneralizedHyperbolic includes all the functionality of
		HyperbolicDist and more and is based on a more rational design.
		HyperbolicDist provides functions for the hyperbolic and
		related distributions. Density, distribution and quantile
		functions and random number generation are provided for the
		hyperbolic distribution, the generalized hyperbolic
		distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and
		the skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality is
		provided for the hyperbolic distribution, including fitting of
		the hyperbolic to data.
