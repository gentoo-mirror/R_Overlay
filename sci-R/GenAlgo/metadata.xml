		Classes and methods to use genetic algorithms for feature
		selection // This package defines classes and methods that can
		be used to implement genetic algorithms for feature selection.
		The idea is that we want to select a fixed number of features
		to combine into a linear classifier that can predict a binary
		outcome, and can use a genetic algorithm heuristically to
		select an optimal set of features.
