		Analysis of Ontologies and Protein Domain Annotations // The
		package is used to analyse domain-centric ontologies and
		annotations, particularly those in the dcGO database. The dcGO
		(http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO) is a comprehensive domain-
		centric database for annotating protein domains using a panel
		of ontologies including Gene Ontology. With the package, users
		are expected to analyse and visualise domain-centric ontologies
		and annotations. Supported analyses include but are not limited
		to: easy access to a wide range of ontologies and their domain-
		centric annotations; able to build customised ontologies and
		annotations; domain-based enrichment analysis and
		visualisation; construction of a domain (semantic similarity)
		network according to ontology annotations; significance
		analysis for estimating a contact (statistical significance)
		network via Random Walk with Restart; and high-performance
		parallel computing. The under-development functionalities are:
		1) to create domain-centric ontologies; 2) to predict ontology
		terms for input protein sequences (precisely domain content in
		the form of architectures) plus to assess the predictions; 3)
		to reconstruct ancestral discrete characters using maximum
		likelihood/parsimony.
