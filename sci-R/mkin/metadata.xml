		Kinetic Evaluation of Chemical Degradation Data // Calculation
		routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006, 2014).
		Includes a function for conveniently defining differential
		equation models, model solution based on eigenvalues if
		possible or using numerical solvers and a choice of the
		optimisation methods made available by the 'FME' package.  If a
		C compiler (on windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential
		equation models are solved using compiled C functions.  Please
		note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or
		fitness for a particular purpose.
