		Estimating Abundance of Clones from DNA fragmentation data //
		Estimate the abundance of cell clones from the distribution of
		lengths of DNA fragments (as created by sonication, whence
		`sonicLength').  The algorithm in "Estimating abundances of
		retroviral insertion sites from DNA fragment length data" by
		Berry CC, Gillet NA, Melamed A, Gormley N, Bangham CR, Bushman
		FD. Bioinformatics; 2012 Mar 15;28(6):755-62 is implemented.
		The experimental setting and estimation details are described
		in detail there. Briefly, integration of new DNA in a host
		genome (due to retroviral infection or gene therapy) can be
		tracked using DNA sequencing, potentially allowing
		characterization of the abundance of individual cell clones
		bearing distinct integration sites. The locations of
		integration sites can be determined by fragmenting the host DNA
		(via sonication or fragmentase), breaking the newly integrated
		DNA at a known sequence, amplifying the fragments containing
		both host and integrated DNA, sequencing those amplicons, then
		mapping the host sequences to positions on the reference
		genome. The relative number of fragments containing a given
		position in the host genome estimates the relative abundance of
		cells hosting the corresponding integration site, but that
		number is not available and the count of amplicons per fragment
		varies widely.  However, the expected number of distinct
		fragment lengths is a function of the abundance of cells
		hosting an integration site at a given position and a certain
		nuisance parameter. The algorithm implicitly estimates that
		function to estimate the relative abundance.
