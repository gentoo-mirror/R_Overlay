		statistical inference and modeling of genealogies generated by
		epidemic and ecological processes // rcolgem is a package for
		phylodynamic inference using population genetic models. rcolgem
		implements coalescent models for populations with nonlinear
		dynamics and potentially many demes, and other population
		genetic models may be supported in the future.  This package is
		well suited for studying infectious disease epidemics and
		inference of epidemiological parameters from pathogen
		phylogenies. The package can also be used for phylogeographic
		analysis and estimation of demographic histories (population
		size through time). rcolgem is not a package for conducting
		phylogenetic inference, although such packages are available in
		R and such tools may be incorporated in the future. A time-
		scaled genealogy with known times of sampling is a necessary
		input for most functions in rcolgem.  Currently, rcolgem works
		best for fitting deterministic demographic models (e.g. systems
		of ordinary differential equations). Future versions may
		incorporate particle filters for fitting stochastic models.
		rcolgem also provides methods for simulating trees conditional
		on a demographic process.
