		Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models //
		Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis
		tests in multivariate linear models. HE plots represent sums-
		of-squares-and-products matrices for linear hypotheses and for
		error using ellipses (in two dimensions) and ellipsoids (in
		three dimensions).  The related "candisc" package provides
		visualizations in a reduced-rank canonical discriminant space
		when there are more than a few response variables.
