		A user friendly R package to perform the network enrichment
		analysis (NEA). // neaGUI is an easy to use R package developed
		to perform the network enrichment analysis (NEA) proposed by
		Alexeyenko et al. (2012). The NEA method extends the overlap
		statistics in GSEA to network links between genes in the
		experimental set and those in the functional categories by
		exploiting biological information in terms of gene interaction
		network. The neaGUI requires the following R packages: tcltk,
		KEGG.db, GO.db, reactome.db, org.Hs.eg.db, AnnotationDbi, and
		hwriter.
