		Linear Inverse Model examples and solution methods. // Functions
		that read and solve linear inverse problems (food web problems,
		linear programming problems). These problems find solutions to
		linear or quadratic functions: min or max (f(x)), where f(x) =
		||Ax-b||^2 or f(x) = sum(ai*xi) subject to equality constraints
		Ex=f and inequality constraints Gx=h. Uses package limSolve.
