		Classifies RNA Structure Change in Chemical Mapping Data //
		Mutations in RNA will create a riboSNitch, if important
		structural elements are disrupted.Recent ultra-high throughput
		techniques, such as SHAPE-MaP and PARS, enable the collection
		of structural RNA information on a genome-wide scale. With the
		ability to gather genome-wide structural information on RNA, it
		is important to accurately classify these structural data in
		order to identify those structural changes that result in a
		phenotypic outcome. We have developed an automated approach to
		classify structure change in SHAPE data. This method utilizes
		random forest classification on a set of pattern and magnitude
		parameters from the mutate and map SHAPE data set (or another
		user specified data set) to build a classifier. The classifier
		is then used to identify structure change in other SHAPE
		traces. Enabling scientists to identify structure change may
		help guide experiments that examine RNA structure and its role
		in biological processes.
