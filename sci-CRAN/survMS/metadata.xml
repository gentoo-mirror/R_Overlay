		Survival Model Simulation // Package enables the data simulation
		from different survival models (Cox, AFT, and AH models). The
		simulated data will have various levels of complexity according
		to the survival model considered. The implemented methods for
		the Cox model are described in Ralf Bender, Thomas Augustin,
		Maria Blettner (2004) doi:10.1002/sim.2059.
