		Computing Scales of Spatial Smoothing for Confounding Adjustment
		// Computes the effective range of a smoothing matrix, which is
		a measure of the distance to which smoothing occurs. This is
		motivated by the application of spatial splines for adjusting
		for unmeasured spatial confounding in regression models, but
		the calculation of effective range can be applied to smoothing
		matrices in other contexts. For algorithmic details, see Rainey
		and Keller (2024) "spconfShiny: an R Shiny application..."
