		Simplification of Decision Tables using Rough Sets // Rough Sets
		were introduced by Zdzislaw Pawlak on his book "Rough Sets:
		Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning About Data". Rough Sets
		provide a formal method to approximate crisp sets when the set-
		element belonging relationship is either known or undetermined.
		This enables the use of Rough Sets for reasoning about
		incomplete or contradictory knowledge. A decision table is a
		prescription of the decisions to make given some conditions.
		Such decision tables can be reduced without losing prescription
		ability. This package provides the classes and methods for
		knowledge reduction from decision tables as presented in the
		chapter 7 of the aforementioned book. This package provides
		functions for calculating the both the discernibility matrix
		and the essential parts of decision tables.
