		Benthic Biotic Indices Calculation from Composition Data // Set
		of functions to calculate Benthic Biotic Indices from
		composition data, obtained whether from morphotaxonomic
		inventories or sequencing data. Based on reference ecological
		weights publicly available for a set of commonly used marine
		biotic indices, such as AMBI (A Marine Biotic Index, Borja et
		al., 2000) doi:10.1016/S0025-326X(00)00061-8 NSI (Norwegian
		Sensitivity Index) and ISI (Indicator Species Index) (Rygg
		2013, ISBN:978-82-577-6210-0). It provides the ecological
		quality status of the samples based on each BBI as well as the
		normalized Ecological Quality Ratio.
