		Empirical Bayesian Lasso and Elastic Net Methods for Generalized
		Linear Models // Provides empirical Bayesian lasso and elastic
		net algorithms for variable selection and effect estimation.
		Key features include sparse variable selection and effect
		estimation via generalized linear regression models, high
		dimensionality with pn, and significance test for nonzero
		effects. This package outperforms other popular methods such as
		lasso and elastic net methods in terms of power of detection,
		false discovery rate, and power of detecting grouping effects.
