		Cyclic Coordinate Descent for Logistic, Poisson and Survival
		Analysis // This model fitting tool incorporates cyclic
		coordinate descent and majorization-minimization approaches to
		fit a variety of regression models found in large-scale
		observational healthcare data.  Implementations focus on
		computational optimization and fine-scale parallelization to
		yield efficient inference in massive datasets.
