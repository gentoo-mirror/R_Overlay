		Generalized Linear Regression with DDM // Drift-Diffusion Model
		(DDM) has been widely used to model binary decision-making
		tasks, and many research studies the relationship between DDM
		parameters and other characteristics of the subject. This
		package uses 'RStan' to perform generalized liner regression
		analysis over DDM parameters via a single Bayesian Hierarchical
		model. Compared to estimating DDM parameters followed by a
		separate regression model, 'RegDDM' reduces bias and improves
		statistical power.
