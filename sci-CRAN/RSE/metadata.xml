		Number of Newly Discovered Rare Species Estimation // A Bayesian-
		weighted estimator and two unweighted estimators are developed
		to estimate the number of newly found rare species in
		additional ecological samples. Among these methods, the
		Bayesian-weighted estimator and an unweighted (Chao-derived)
		estimator are of high accuracy and recommended for practical
		applications. Technical details of the proposed estimators have
		been well described in the following paper: Shen TJ, Chen YH
		(2018) A Bayesian weighted approach to predicting the number of
		newly discovered rare species. Conservation Biology, In press.
