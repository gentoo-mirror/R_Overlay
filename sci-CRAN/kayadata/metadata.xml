		Kaya Identity Data for Nations and Regions // Provides data for
		Kaya identity variables (population, gross domestic product,
		primary energy consumption, and energy-related CO2 emissions)
		for the world and for individual nations, and utility functions
		for looking up data,  plotting trends of Kaya variables, and
		plotting the fuel mix for a given country or region. The Kaya
		identity (Yoichi Kaya and Keiichi Yokobori, "Environment,
		Energy, and Economy: Strategies for Sustainability" (United
		Nations University Press, 1998) and
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_identity) expresses a
		nation's or region's greenhouse gas emissions in terms of its
		population, per-capita Gross Domestic Product, the energy
		intensity of its economy, and the carbon-intensity of its
		energy supply.
