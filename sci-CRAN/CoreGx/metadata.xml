		Classes and Functions to Serve as the Basis for Other 'Gx'
		Packages // A collection of functions and classes which serve
		as the foundation for our lab's suite of R packages, such as
		'PharmacoGx' and 'RadioGx'. This package was created to
		abstract shared functionality from other lab package releases
		to increase ease of maintainability and reduce code repetition
		in current and future 'Gx' suite programs. Major features
		include a 'CoreSet' class, from which 'RadioSet' and
		'PharmaSet' are derived, along with get and set methods for
		each respective slot. Additional functions related to fitting
		and plotting dose response curves, quantifying statistical
		correlation and calculating area under the curve (AUC) or
		survival fraction (SF) are included. For more details please
		see the included documentation, as well as: Smirnov, P.,
		Safikhani, Z., El-Hachem, N., Wang, D., She, A., Olsen, C.,
		Freeman, M., Selby, H., Gendoo, D., Grossman, P., Beck, A.,
		Aerts, H., Lupien, M., Goldenberg, A. (2015)
