		Omics Data Integration Using Kernel Methods // Kernel-based
		methods are powerful methods for integrating heterogeneous
		types of data. mixKernel aims at providing methods to combine
		kernel for unsupervised exploratory analysis. Different
		solutions are provided to compute a meta-kernel, in a consensus
		way or in a way that best preserves the original topology of
		the data. mixKernel also integrates kernel PCA to visualize
		similarities between samples in a non linear space and from the
		multiple source point of view
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx682. A method to select (as well
		as funtions to display) important variables is also provided
