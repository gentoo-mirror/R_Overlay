		Athlete Maturation and Biobanding // Identifying maturation
		stages across young athletes is paramount for talent
		identification. Furthermore, the concept of biobanding, or
		grouping of athletes based on their biological development,
		instead of their chronological age, has been widely researched.
		The goal of this package is to help professionals working in
		the field of strength  conditioning and talent ID obtain common
		maturation metrics and as well as to quickly visualize this
		information via several plotting options. For the methods
		behind the computed maturation metrics implemented in this
		package refer to Khamis, H. J.,  Roche, A. F. (1994)

		(2002) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11932580/ and Cumming,
		Sean P. et al., (2017) doi:10.1519/SSC.0000000000000281.
