		Fractions of Multivariate Polynomials with Rational Coefficients
		// Based on the 'qspray' package, this package introduces the
		new type 'ratioOfQsprays'. An object of type 'qspray'
		represents a multivariate polynomial with rational coefficients
		while an object of type 'ratioOfQsprays', defined by two
		'qspray' objects, represents a fraction of two multivariate
		polynomials with rational coefficients. Arithmetic operations
		for these objects are available, and they always return
		irreducible fractions. Other features include: differentiation,
		evaluation, conversion to a function, and fine control of the
		way to print a 'ratioOfQsprays' object. The 'C++' library
		'CGAL' is used to make the fractions irreducible.
