		Rational Approximations of Fractional Stochastic Partial
		Differential Equations // Functions that compute rational
		approximations of fractional elliptic stochastic partial
		differential equations. The package also contains functions for
		common statistical usage of these approximations. The main
		reference for the methods is Bolin and Kirchner (2019)
		arXiv:1711.04333, which can be generated by the citation
