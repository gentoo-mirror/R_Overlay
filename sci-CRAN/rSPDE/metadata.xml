		Rational Approximations of Fractional Stochastic Partial
		Differential Equations // Functions that compute rational
		approximations of fractional elliptic stochastic partial
		differential equations. The package also contains functions for
		common statistical usage of these approximations. The main
		references for rSPDE are Bolin, Simas and Xiong (2023)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2023.2231051 for the covariance-based
		method and Bolin and Kirchner (2020)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1665537 for the operator-based
		rational approximation. These can be generated by the citation
		function in R.
