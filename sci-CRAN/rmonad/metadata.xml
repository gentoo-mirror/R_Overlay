		A Monadic Pipeline System // A monadic solution to pipeline
		analysis. All operations -- and the errors, warnings and
		messages they emit -- are merged into a directed graph. Infix
		binary operators mediate when values are stored, how exceptions
		are handled, and where pipelines branch and merge. The
		resulting structure may be queried for debugging or report
		generation. 'rmonad' complements, rather than competes with,
		non-monadic pipeline packages like 'magrittr' or 'pipeR'.
