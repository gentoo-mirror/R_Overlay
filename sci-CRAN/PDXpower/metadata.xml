		Time to Event Outcome in Experimental Designs of Pre-Clinical
		Studies // Conduct simulation-based customized power
		calculation for clustered time to event data in a mixed
		crossed/nested design, where a number of cell lines and a
		number of mice within each cell line are considered to achieve
		a desired statistical power, motivated by Eckel-Passow and
		colleagues (2021) doi:10.1093/neuonc/noab137. This package
		provides two commonly used models for powering a design, linear
		mixed effects and Cox frailty model. Both models account for
		within-subject (cell line) correlation while holding different
		distributional assumptions about the outcome. Alternatively,
		the counterparts of fixed effects model are also available,
		which produces similar estimates of statistical power.
