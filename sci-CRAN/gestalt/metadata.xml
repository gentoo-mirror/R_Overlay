		Tools for Making and Combining Functions // Provides a suite of
		function-building tools centered around a (forward) composition
		operator, %%, which extends the semantics of the 'magrittr' %%
		operator and supports 'tidyverse' quasiquotation. It enables
		you to construct composite functions that can be inspected and
		transformed as list-like objects. In conjunction with %%, a
		compact function constructor, fn(), and a function that
		performs partial application, partial(), are also provided.
		Both support quasiquotation.
