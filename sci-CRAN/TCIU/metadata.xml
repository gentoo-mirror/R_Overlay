		Spacekime Analytics, Time Complexity and Inferential Uncertainty
		// Provide the core functionality to transform longitudinal
		data to complex-time (kime) data using analytic and numerical
		techniques, visualize the original time-series and
		reconstructed kime-surfaces, perform model based (e.g., tensor-
		linear regression) and model-free classification and clustering
		methods in the book Dinov, ID and Velev, MV. (2021) "Data
		Science: Time Complexity, Inferential Uncertainty, and
		Spacekime Analytics", De Gruyter STEM Series, ISBN
		978-3-11-069780-3. https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/576646.
		The package includes 18 core functions which can be separated
		into three groups. 1) draw longitudinal data, such as fMRI
		time-series, and forecast or transform the time-series data. 2)
		simulate real-valued time-series data, e.g., fMRI time-courses,
		detect the activated areas, report the corresponding p-values,
		and visualize the p-values in the 3D brain space. 3) Laplace
		transform and kimesurface reconstructions of the fMRI data.
