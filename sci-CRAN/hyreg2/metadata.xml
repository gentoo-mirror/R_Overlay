		Estimate Latent Classes on a Mixture of Continuous and
		Dichotomous Data // EQ-5D value set estimation can be done
		using the hybrid model likelihood as described by Oppe and van
		Hout (2010) doi:10.1002/hec.3560 and Ramos-Goi et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1097/MLR.0000000000000283 . The package is based on
		`flexmix()` and among others contains an M-step-driver as
		described by Leisch (2004) doi:10.18637/jss.v011.i08. Users can
		estimate latent classes and address preference heterogeneity.
		Both uncensored and censored data are supported. Furthermore,
		heteroscedasticity can be taken into account. It is possible to
		control for different covariates on the continuous and
		dichotomous parts of the data and start values can differ
		between the expected latent classes.
