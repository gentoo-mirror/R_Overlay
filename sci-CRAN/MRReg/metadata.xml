		MDL Multiresolution Linear Regression Framework // We provide the
		framework to analyze multiresolution partitions (e.g. country,
		provinces, subdistrict) where each individual data point
		belongs to only one partition in each layer (e.g. i belongs to
		subdistrict A, province P, and country Q).   We assume that a
		partition in a higher layer subsumes lower-layer partitions
		(e.g. a nation is at the 1st layer subsumes all provinces at
		the 2nd layer). Given N individuals that have a pair of real
		values (x,y) that generated from  independent variable X and
		dependent variable Y. Each individual i belongs to one
		partition per layer. Our goal is to find which partitions at
		which highest level that all individuals  in the these
		partitions share the same linear model Y=f(X) where f is a
		linear function. The framework deploys the Minimum Description
		Length principle (MDL) to infer solutions. The publication of
		this package is at Chainarong Amornbunchornvej, Navaporn
		Surasvadi, Anon Plangprasopchok, and Suttipong Thajchayapong
