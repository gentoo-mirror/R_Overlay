		Aggregation Trees // Nonparametric data-driven approach to
		discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-
		observables framework. Aggregation trees allow researchers to
		assess whether there is relevant heterogeneity in treatment
		effects. The approach generates a sequence of optimal
		groupings, one for each level of granularity. For each
		grouping, we obtain point estimation and inference about the
		Group Average Treatment Effects. Please reference the use as Di
