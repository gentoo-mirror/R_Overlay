		Small Area Estimation for Continuous Zero Inflated Data //
		Simplifies the process of fitting a zero-inflated estimator
		onto a dataset. This estimator is a combination of a linear
		mixed effects regression model and a logistic mixed effects
		regression model which is summarized by White and others (2024,
		arXiv:2402.03263). The variance is estimated through a
		parametric bootstrapping method which is given by Chandra and
		others (2012, doi:10.1080/03610918.2011.598991).
