		Style Time Series Plots Like the Wall Street Journal // Easily
		override the default visual choices in 'ggplot2' to make your
		time series plots look more like the Wall Street Journal.
		Specific theme design choices include omitting x-axis grid
		lines and displaying sparse light grey y-axis grid lines.
		Additionally, this allows to label the y-axis scales with your
		units only displayed on the top-most number, while also
		removing the bottom most number (unless specifically
		overridden). The goal is visual simplicity, because who has
		time to waste looking at a cluttered graph?
