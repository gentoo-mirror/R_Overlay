		Linear Mixed Model Solver // An efficient and flexible system to
		solve sparse mixed model equations, for models that are often
		used in statistical genetics. Important applications are the
		use of splines to model spatial or temporal trends. Another
		application area is mixed model QTL analysis for multiparental
		populations, allowing for heterogeneous residual variance and
		random design matrices with Identity-By-Descent (IBD)
		probabilities.
