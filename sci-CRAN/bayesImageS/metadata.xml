		Bayesian Methods for Image Segmentation using a Potts Model //
		Various algorithms for segmentation of 2D and 3D images, such
		as computed tomography and satellite remote sensing. This
		package implements Bayesian image analysis using the hidden
		Potts model with external field prior. Latent labels are
		sampled using chequerboard updating or Swendsen-Wang.
		Algorithms for the smoothing parameter include
		pseudolikelihood, path sampling, the exchange algorithm,
		approximate Bayesian computation (ABC-MCMC and ABC-SMC), and
		Bayesian indirect likelihood (BIL).
