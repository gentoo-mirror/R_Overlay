		Project Future Case Incidence // Provides functions and graphics
		for projecting daily incidence based on past incidence, and
		estimates of the serial interval and reproduction number.
		Projections are based on a branching process using a Poisson-
		distributed number of new cases per day, similar to the model
		used for estimating R0 in 'EpiEstim' or in 'earlyR', and
		described by Nouvellet et al. (2017)
