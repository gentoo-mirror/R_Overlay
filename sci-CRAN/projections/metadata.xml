		Project Future Case Incidence // Provides functions and graphics
		for projecting daily incidence based on past incidence, and
		estimates of the serial interval and reproduction number.
		Projections are based on a branching process using a Poisson-
		distributed number of new cases per day, similar to the model
		used for estimating R in 'EpiEstim' or in 'earlyR', and
		described by Nouvellet et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1016/j.epidem.2017.02.012. The package provides the S3
		class 'projections' which extends 'matrix', with accessors and
		additional helpers for handling, subsetting, merging, or adding
		these objects, as well as dedicated printing and plotting
		methods.
