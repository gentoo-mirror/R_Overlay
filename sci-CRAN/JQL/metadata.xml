		Jump Q-Learning for Individualized Interval-Valued Dose Rule //
		We provide tools to estimate the individualized interval-valued
		dose rule (I2DR) that maximizes the expected beneficial
		clinical outcome for each individual and returns an optimal
		interval-valued dose, by using the jump Q-learning method. The
		jump Q-learning method directly models the conditional mean of
		the response given the dose level and the baseline covariates
		via jump penalized least squares regression under the framework
		of Q learning. We develop a searching algorithm by dynamic
		programming in order to find the optimal I2DR with the time
		complexity O(n2) and spatial complexity O(n). The outcome of
		interest includes the best partition of the entire dosage of
		interest, the regression coefficients of each partition, and
		the value function under the estimated I2DR as well as the
		Wald-type confidence interval of value function constructed
		through the Bootstrap.
