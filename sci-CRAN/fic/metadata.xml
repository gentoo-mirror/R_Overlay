		Focused Information Criteria for Model Comparison // Compares how
		well different models estimate a quantity of interest (the
		"focus") so that different models may be preferred for
		different purposes.  Comparisons within any class of models
		fitted by maximum likelihood are supported, with shortcuts for
		commonly-used classes such as generalised linear models and
		parametric survival models.  The methods originate from
		Claeskens and Hjort (2003) doi:10.1198/016214503000000819 and
		Claeskens and Hjort (2008, ISBN:9780521852258).
