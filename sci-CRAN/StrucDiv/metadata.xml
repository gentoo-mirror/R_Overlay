		Spatial Structural Diversity Quantification in Raster Data //
		Spatial structural diversity refers to the spatial, i.e.
		horizontal arrangement of landscape elements and can reveal
		itself as landscape features, such as patches and linear
		features. The 'R' package 'StrucDiv' provides methods to
		quantify spatial structural diversity in continuous remote
		sensing data, or in other data in raster format. Structure is
		based on the spatial arrangement of value pairs. The 'R'
		package 'StrucDiv' includes methods to combine information from
		different spatial scales, which allows to quantify multi-scale
		spatial structural diversity.
