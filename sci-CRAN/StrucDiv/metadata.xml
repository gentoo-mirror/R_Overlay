		Spatial Structural Diversity Quantification in Raster Data //
		Spatial structural diversity refers to the spatial arrangement
		of landscape elements and can reveal itself as landscape
		features, such as patches and line features. The 'R' package
		'StrucDiv' provides methods to quantify spatial structural
		diversity in continuous remote sensing data, or in other data
		in gridded field format. The methods are based on second-order
		texture metrics, considering the spatial arrangement of pixel
		pairs.
