		Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression // Fit a logistic
		regression model using Firth's bias reduction method,
		equivalent to penalization of the log-likelihood by the
		Jeffreys prior. Confidence intervals for regression
		coefficients can be computed by penalized profile likelihood.
		Firth's method was proposed as ideal solution to the problem of
		separation in logistic regression, see Heinze and Schemper
		(2002) doi:10.1002/sim.1047. If needed, the bias reduction can
		be turned off such that ordinary maximum likelihood logistic
		regression is obtained. Two new modifications of Firth's
		method, FLIC and FLAC, lead to unbiased predictions and are now
		available in the package as well, see Puhr, Heinze, Nold, Lusa
		and Geroldinger (2017) doi:10.1002/sim.7273.
