		Birnbaum-Saunders Model Based on Skew-Normal Distribution // It
		provides the density, distribution function, quantile function,
		random number generator, reliability function, failure rate,
		likelihood function, moments and EM algorithm for Maximum
		Likelihood estimators, also empirical quantile and generated
		envelope for a given sample, all this for the three parameter
		Birnbaum-Saunders model based on Skew-Normal Distribution.
		Additionally, it provides the random number generator for the
		mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders model based on Skew-Normal
		distribution.
