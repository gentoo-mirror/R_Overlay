		Birnbaum-Saunders Model // It provides the density, distribution
		function, quantile function, random number generator,
		reliability function, failure rate, likelihood function,
		moments and EM algorithm for Maximum Likelihood estimators,
		also empirical quantile and generated envelope for a given
		sample, all this for the three parameter Birnbaum-Saunders
		model based on Skew-Normal Distribution. Also, it provides the
		random number generator for the mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders
		model based on Skew-Normal distribution. Additionally, we
		incorporate the EM algorithm based on the assumption that the
		error term follows a finite mixture of Sinh-normal
		distributions.
