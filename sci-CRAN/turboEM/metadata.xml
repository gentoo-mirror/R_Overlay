		A Suite of Convergence Acceleration Schemes for EM, MM and Other
		Fixed-Point Algorithms // Algorithms for accelerating the
		convergence of slow, monotone sequences from smooth,
		contraction mapping such as the EM and MM algorithms. It can be
		used to accelerate any smooth, linearly convergent acceleration
		scheme.  A tutorial style introduction to this package is
		available in a vignette on the CRAN download page or, when the
		package is loaded in an R session, with vignette("turboEM").
