		Provides Easy Downloading Capabilities for the UK Parliament API
		// Provides functions to download data from the
		http://www.data.parliament.uk/ APIs. Because of the structure
		of the API, there is a named function for each type of
		available data for ease of use, as well as some functions
		designed to retrieve specific pieces of commonly used data.
		Functions for each new API will be added as and when they
		become available.
