		Generalized Ridge Regression for Linear Models // Ridge
		regression due to Hoerl and Kennard
		(1970)DOI:10.1080/00401706.1970.10488634 and generalized ridge
		regression due to Yang and Emura
		(2017)DOI:10.1080/03610918.2016.1193195 with optimized tuning
		parameters. These ridge regression estimators (the HK estimator
		and the YE estimator) are computed by minimizing the cross-
		validated mean squared errors. Both the ridge and generalized
		ridge estimators are applicable for high-dimensional regressors
		(pn), where p is the number of regressors, and n is the sample
		size.
