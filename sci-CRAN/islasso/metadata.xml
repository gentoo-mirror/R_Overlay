		The Induced Smoothed Lasso // An implementation of the induced
		smoothing idea that focuses on hypothesis testing in lasso
		regularization models (IS-lasso). Linear, logistic, Poisson and
		gamma regressions with several link functions are already
		implemented. The algorithm uses the steps as described in the
		original paper. See: The Induced Smoothed lasso: A practical
		framework for hypothesis testing in high dimensional
		regression. Cilluffo, G., Sottile, G., La Grutta, S. and
		Muggeo, V. (2019) doi:10.1177/0962280219842890.
