		The Induced Smoothed Lasso // An implementation of the induced
		smoothing (IS) idea to lasso regularization models to allow
		estimation and inference on the model coefficients (currently
		hypothesis testing only). Linear, logistic, Poisson and gamma
		regressions with several link functions are implemented. The
		algorithm is described in the original paper; see
		doi:10.1177/0962280219842890 and discussed in a tutorial
		doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.16360.11521.
