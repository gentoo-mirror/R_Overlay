		The Induced Smoothed Lasso // An implementation of the induced
		smoothing (IS) idea to lasso regularization models to allow
		estimation and inference on the model coefficients (currently
		hypothesis testing only). Linear, logistic, Poisson and gamma
		regressions with several link functions are implemented. The
		algorithm is described in the original paper: Cilluffo, G.,
		Sottile, G., La Grutta, S. and Muggeo, V. (2019) The Induced
		Smoothed lasso: A practical framework for hypothesis testing in
		high dimensional regression. doi:10.1177/0962280219842890, and
		discussed in a tutorial: Sottile, G., Cilluffo, G., and Muggeo,
		V. (2019) The R package islasso: estimation and hypothesis
		testing in lasso regression. doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.16360.11521.
