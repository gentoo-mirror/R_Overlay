		Plotting Two-Dimensional Confidence Regions // Plots the two-
		dimensional confidence region for probability distribution
		(Weibull or inverse Gaussian) parameters corresponding to a
		user given dataset and level of significance. The crplot()
		algorithm plots more points in areas of greater curvature to
		ensure a smooth appearance throughout the confidence region
		boundary.  An alternative heuristic plots a specified number of
		points at roughly uniform intervals along its boundary.  Both
		heuristics build upon the radial profile log-likelihood ratio
		technique for plotting two-dimensional confidence regions given
		by Jaeger (2016) doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946.
