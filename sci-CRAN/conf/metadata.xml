		Visualization and Analysis of Statistical Measures of Confidence
		// Enables: (1) plotting two-dimensional confidence regions,
		and (2) calculating confidence intervals and the associated
		actual coverage for binomial proportions.  Both are given in
		greater detail next. (1) Plots the two-dimensional confidence
		region for probability distribution parameters (supported
		distribution suffixes: gamma, invgauss, llogis, lnorm, norm,
		unif, weibull) corresponding to a user given dataset and level
		of significance. The crplot() algorithm plots more points in
		areas of greater curvature to ensure a smooth appearance
		throughout the confidence region boundary.  An alternative
		heuristic plots a specified number of points at roughly uniform
		intervals along its boundary.  Both heuristics build upon the
		radial profile log-likelihood ratio technique for plotting two-
		dimensional confidence regions given by Jaeger (2016)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946. (2) Calculates confidence
		interval bounds for a binomial proportion with binomTest(),
		calculates the actual coverage with binomTestCoverage(), and
		plots the actual coverage with binomTestCoveragePlot().
		Calculates confidence interval bounds for the binomial
		proportion using an ensemble of constituent confidence
		intervals with binomTestEnsemble().
