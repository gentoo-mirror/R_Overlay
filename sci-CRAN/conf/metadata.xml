		Visualization and Analysis of Statistical Measures of Confidence
		// Enables: (1) plotting two-dimensional confidence regions,
		(2) coverage analysis of confidence region simulations, (3)
		calculating confidence intervals and the associated actual
		coverage for binomial proportions, (4) calculating the support
		values and the probability mass function of the Kaplan-Meier
		product-limit estimator, and (5) plotting the actual coverage
		function associated with a confidence interval for the survivor
		function from a randomly right-censored data set. Each is given
		in greater detail next. (1) Plots the two-dimensional
		confidence region for probability distribution parameters
		(supported distribution suffixes: cauchy, gamma, invgauss,
		logis, llogis, lnorm, norm, unif, weibull) corresponding to a
		user-given complete or right-censored dataset and level of
		significance.  The crplot() algorithm plots more points in
		areas of greater curvature to ensure a smooth appearance
		throughout the confidence region boundary.  An alternative
		heuristic plots a specified number of points at roughly uniform
		intervals along its boundary. Both heuristics build upon the
		radial profile log-likelihood ratio technique for plotting
		confidence regions given by Jaeger (2016)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946, and are detailed in a
		publication by Weld et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2018.1564696. (2) Performs confidence
		region coverage simulations for a random sample drawn from a
		user- specified parametric population distribution, or for a
		user-specified dataset and point of interest with coversim().
		(3) Calculates confidence interval bounds for a binomial
		proportion with binomTest(), calculates the actual coverage
		with binomTestCoverage(), and plots the actual coverage with
		binomTestCoveragePlot(). Calculates confidence interval bounds
		for the binomial proportion using an ensemble of constituent
		confidence intervals with binomTestEnsemble(). Calculates
		confidence interval bounds for the binomial proportion using a
		complete enumeration of all possible transitions from one
		actual coverage acceptance curve to another which minimizes the
		root mean square error for n = 15 and follows the transitions
		for well-known confidence intervals for n  15 using
		binomTestMSE(). (4) The km.support() function calculates the
		support values of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator for
		a given sample size n using an induction algorithm described in
		Qin et al. (2023) doi:10.1080/00031305.2022.2070279. The
		km.outcomes() function generates a matrix containing all
		possible outcomes (all possible sequences of failure times and
		right-censoring times) of the value of the Kaplan-Meier
		product-limit estimator for a particular sample size n. The
		km.pmf() function generates the probability mass function for
		the support values of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator
		for a particular sample size n, probability of observing a
		failure h at the time of interest expressed as the cumulative
		probability percentile associated with X = min(T, C), where T
		is the failure time and C is the censoring time under a random-
		censoring scheme. The km.surv() function generates multiple
		probability mass functions of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
		estimator for the same arguments as those given for km.pmf().
		(5) The km.coverage() function plots the actual coverage
		function associated with a confidence interval for the survivor
		function from a randomly right-censored data set for one or
		more of the following confidence intervals: Greenwood, log-
		minus-log, Peto, arcsine, and exponential Greenwood.  The
		actual coverage function is plotted for a small number of items
		on test, stated coverage, failure rate, and censoring rate. The
		km.coverage() function can print an optional table containing
		all possible failure/censoring orderings, along with their
		contribution to the actual coverage function.
