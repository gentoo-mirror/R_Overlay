		Visualization and Analysis of Statistical Measures of Confidence
		// Enables: (1) plotting two-dimensional confidence regions,
		(2) coverage analysis of confidence region simulations and (3)
		calculating confidence intervals and the associated actual
		coverage for binomial proportions.  Each is given in greater
		detail next. (1) Plots the two-dimensional confidence region
		for probability distribution parameters (supported distribution
		suffixes: cauchy, gamma, invgauss, logis, llogis, lnorm, norm,
		unif, weibull) corresponding to a user-given complete or right-
		censored dataset and level of significance.  The crplot()
		algorithm plots more points in areas of greater curvature to
		ensure a smooth appearance throughout the confidence region
		boundary.  An alternative heuristic plots a specified number of
		points at roughly uniform intervals along its boundary. Both
		heuristics build upon the radial profile log-likelihood ratio
		technique for plotting confidence regions given by Jaeger
		(2016) doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946. (2) Performs
		confidence region coverage simulations for a random sample
		drawn from a user- specified parametric population
		distribution, or for a user-specified dataset and point of
		interest with coversim(). (3) Calculates confidence interval
		bounds for a binomial proportion with binomTest(), calculates
		the actual coverage with binomTestCoverage(), and plots the
		actual coverage with binomTestCoveragePlot(). Calculates
		confidence interval bounds for the binomial proportion using an
		ensemble of constituent confidence intervals with
		binomTestEnsemble().
