		Volume Prediction of Trees Using Linear and Nonlinear Allometric
		Equations // Volume prediction is one of challenging task in
		forestry research. This package is a comprehensive toolset
		designed for the fitting and validation of various linear and
		nonlinear allometric equations (Linear, Log-Linear, Inverse,
		Quadratic, Cubic, Compound, Power and Exponential) used in the
		prediction of conifer tree volume. This package is particularly
		useful for forestry professionals, researchers, and resource
		managers engaged in assessing and estimating the volume of
		coniferous trees. This package has been developed using the
		algorithm of Sharma et al. (2017)
