		Placental Epigenetic Clock to Estimate Aging by DNA Methylation
		// Placental epigenetic clock to estimate aging based on
		gestational age using DNA methylation levels, so called
		placental epigenetic clock (PlEC). We developed a PlEC for the
		2024 Placental Clock DREAM Challenge
		(https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn59520082/wiki/628063). Our
		PlEC achieved the top performance based on an independent test
		set. PlEC can be used to identify accelerated/decelerated aging
		of placenta for understanding placental dysfunction-related
		conditions, e.g., great obstetrical syndromes including
		preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm labor, preterm
		premature rupture of the membranes, late spontaneous abortion,
		and placental abruption. Detailed methodologies and examples
		are documented in our vignette, available at https://herdiantri
		sufriyana.github.io/rplec/doc/placental_aging_analysis.html.
