		Probability Distributions as S3 Objects // Tools to create and
		manipulate probability distributions using S3.  Generics
		random(), pdf(), cdf() and quantile() provide replacements for
		base R's r/d/p/q style functions.  Functions and arguments have
		been named carefully to minimize confusion for students in
		intro stats courses. The documentation for each distribution
		contains detailed mathematical notes.
