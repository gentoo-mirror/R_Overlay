		Summary Measures for Clinical Trials with Survival Outcomes //
		Provides estimates of the several summary measures for clinical
		trials including the average hazard ratio, the weighted average
		hazard ratio, the restricted superiority probability ratio, the
		restricted mean survival difference and the ratio of restricted
		mean times lost, based on the short-term and long-term hazard
		ratio model (Yang, 2005 doi:10.1093/biomet/92.1.1) which
		accommodates various non-proportional hazards scenarios. The
		inference procedures and the asymptotic results for the summary
		measures are discussed in Yang (2017, pre-print).
