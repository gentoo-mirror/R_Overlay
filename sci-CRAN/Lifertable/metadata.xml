		Life and Fertility Tables Specially for Insects // Life and
		Fertility Tables are appropriate to study the dynamics of
		arthropods populations. This package provides utilities for
		constructing Life Tables and Fertility Tables, related
		demographic parameters, and some simple graphs of interest. It
		also offers functions to transform the obtained data into a
		known format for better manipulation. This document is based on
		the article by Maia, Luiz, and Campanhola "Statistical
		Inference on Associated Fertility Life Table Parameters Using
		Jackknife Technique Computational Aspects" (April 2000, Journal
		of Economic Entomology, Volume 93, Issue 2)
		doi:10.1603/0022-0493-93.2.511.
