		'DT' Extension for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
		Applications in 'shiny' // The core of this package is a
		function eDT() which enhances DT::datatable() such that it can
		be used to interactively modify data in 'shiny'. By the use of
		generic 'dplyr' methods it supports many types of data storage,
		with relational databases ('dbplyr') being the main use case.
