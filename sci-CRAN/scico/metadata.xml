		Colour Palettes Based on the Scientific Colour-Maps // Colour
		choice in information visualisation is important in order to
		avoid being mislead by inherent bias in the used colour
		palette. The 'scico' package provides access to the
		perceptually uniform and colour-blindness friendly palettes
		developed by Fabio Crameri and released under the "Scientific
		Colour-Maps" moniker. The package contains 17 different
		palettes and includes both diverging and sequential types.
