		Scoring the EQ-5D Descriptive System // EQ-5D is a standard
		instrument (https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/) that
		measures the quality of life often used in clinical and
		economic evaluations of health care technologies. Both adult
		versions of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L) contain a descriptive
		system and visual analog scale. The descriptive system measures
		the patient's health in 5 dimensions: the 5L versions has 5
		levels and 3L version has 3 levels. The descriptive system
		scores are usually converted to index values using country
		specific values sets (that incorporates the country
		preferences). This package allows the calculation of both
		descriptive system scores to the index value scores. The value
		sets for EQ-5D-3L are from the references mentioned in the
		website
		https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-3l-about/valuation/
		The value sets for EQ-5D-3L for a total of 31 countries are
		used for the valuation (see the user guide for a complete list
		of references). The value sets for EQ-5D-5L are obtained from
		references mentioned in the
		https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about/valuation-
		standard-value-sets/ and other sources. The value sets for
		EQ-5D-5L for a total of 17 countries are used for the valuation
		(see the user guide for a complete list of references). The
		package can also be used to map 5L scores to 3L index values
		for 10 countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands,
		Spain, Thailand, UK, USA, and Zimbabwe. The value set and
		method for mapping are obtained from Van Hout et al (2012) doi:
		10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008.
