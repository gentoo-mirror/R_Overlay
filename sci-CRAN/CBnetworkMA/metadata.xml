		Contrast-Based Bayesian Network Meta Analysis // A function that
		facilitates fitting three types of models for contrast-based
		Bayesian Network Meta Analysis.  The first model is that which
		is described in Lu and Ades (2006)
		doi:10.1198/016214505000001302.  The other two models are based
		on a Bayesian nonparametric methods that permit ties when
		comparing treatment or for a treatment effect to be exactly
		equal to zero. In addition to the model fits, the package
		provides a summary of the interplay  between treatment effects
		based on the procedure described in Barrientos, Page, and Lin
		(2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2207.06561.
