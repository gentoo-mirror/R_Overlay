		Application of Optimal Transport to Functional Data Analysis //
		These functions were developed to support statistical analysis
		on functional covariance operators. The package contains
		functions to: - compute 2-Wasserstein distances between
		Gaussian Processes as in Masarotto, Panaretos  Zemel (2019)
		doi:10.1007/s13171-018-0130-1; - compute the Wasserstein
		barycenter (Frechet mean) as in Masarotto, Panaretos  Zemel
		(2019) doi:10.1007/s13171-018-0130-1; - perform analysis of
		variance testing procedures for functional covariances and
		tangent space principal component analysis of covariance
		operators as in Masarotto, Panaretos  Zemel (2022)
		arXiv:2212.04797. - perform a soft-clustering based on the
		Wasserstein distance where functional data are classified based
		on their covariance structure as in Masarotto  Masarotto (2023)
		doi:10.1111/sjos.12692.
