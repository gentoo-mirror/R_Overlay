		Forest Attributes in U.S. States // A small subset of plots
		throughout the U.S. are sampled and assessed "on-the-ground" as
		forested or non-forested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
		Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program,
		but the FIA also has access to remotely sensed data for all
		land in the country. The 'forested' package contains data
		frames intended for use in predictive modeling applications
		where the more easily-accessible remotely sensed data can be
		used to predict whether a plot is forested or non-forested.
		Currently, the package provides data for Washington and
		Georgia.
