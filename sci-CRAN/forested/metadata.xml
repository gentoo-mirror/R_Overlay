		Forest Attributes in Washington State // A small subset of plots
		in Washington State are sampled and assessed "on-the-ground" as
		forested or non-forested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
		Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program,
		but the FIA also has access to remotely sensed data for all
		land in the state. The 'forested' package contains a data frame
		by the same name intended for use in predictive modeling
		applications where the more easily-accessible remotely sensed
		data can be used to predict whether a plot is forested or non-
		forested.
