		Finite Mixture Model Fitting of Lifespan Datasets // Fits the
		lifespan datasets of biological systems such as yeast, fruit
		flies, and other similar biological units with well-known
		finite mixture models introduced by Farewell V. (1982)
		doi:10.2307/2529885 and Al-Hussaini et al. (2000)
		doi:10.1080/00949650008812033. Estimates parameter space
		fitting of a lifespan dataset with finite mixtures of
		parametric distributions. Computes the following tasks; 1)
		Estimates parameter space of the finite mixture model by
		implementing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. 2)
		Finds a sequence of four goodness-of-fit measures consist of
		Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information
		Criterion (BIC), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), and log-likelihood
		(log-likelihood) statistics. 3)The initial values is determined
		by k-means clustering.
