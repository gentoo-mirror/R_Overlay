		Bayesian Flexible Parametric Survival Modelling and Extrapolation
		// Survival analysis using a flexible Bayesian model for
		individual-level right-censored data, optionally combined with
		aggregate data on counts of survivors in different periods of
		time. An M-spline is used to describe the hazard function, with
		a prior on the coefficients that controls over-fitting.
		Proportional hazards or flexible non-proportional hazards
		models can be used to relate survival to predictors. Additive
		hazards (relative survival) models, waning treatment effects,
		and mixture cure models are also supported. Priors can be
		customised and calibrated to substantive beliefs. Posterior
		distributions are estimated using 'Stan', and outputs are
		arranged in a tidy format. See Jackson (2023)
