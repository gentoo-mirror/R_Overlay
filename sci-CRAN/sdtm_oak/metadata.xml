		SDTM Data Transformation Engine // An Electronic Data Capture
		system (EDC) and Data Standard agnostic solution that enables
		the pharmaceutical programming community to develop Clinical
		Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data
		Tabulation Model (SDTM) datasets in R. The reusable algorithms
		concept in 'sdtm.oak' provides a framework for modular
		programming and can potentially automate the conversion of raw
		clinical data to SDTM through standardized SDTM specifications.
		SDTM is one of the required standards for data submission to
		the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and
		Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan.
		SDTM standards are implemented following the SDTM
		Implementation Guide as defined by CDISC
		https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig.
