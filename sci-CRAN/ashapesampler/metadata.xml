		Generating Alpha Shapes // Understanding morphological variation
		is an important task in many applications. Recent studies in
		computational biology have focused on developing computational
		tools for the task of sub-image selection which aims at
		identifying structural features that best describe the
		variation between classes of shapes. A major part in assessing
		the utility of these approaches is to demonstrate their
		performance on both simulated and real datasets. However, when
		creating a model for shape statistics, real data can be
		difficult to access and the sample sizes for these data are
		often small due to them being expensive to collect. Meanwhile,
		the landscape of current shape simulation methods has been
		mostly limited to approaches that use black-box inference---
		making it difficult to systematically assess the power and
		calibration of sub-image models. In this R package, we
		introduce the alpha-shape sampler: a probabilistic framework
		for simulating realistic 2D and 3D shapes based on probability
		distributions which can be learned from real data or explicitly
		stated by the user. The 'ashapesampler' package supports two
		mechanisms for sampling shapes in two and three dimensions. The
		first, empirically sampling based on an existing data set, was
		highlighted in the original main text of the paper. The second,
		probabilistic sampling from a known distribution, is the
		computational implementation of the theory derived in that
		paper. Work based on Winn-Nunez et al. (2024)
