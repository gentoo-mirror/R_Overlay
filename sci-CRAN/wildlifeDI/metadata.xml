		Calculate Indices of Dynamic Interaction for Wildlife Tracking
		Data // Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal
		associations in the movements of two (or more) animals. This
		package provides tools for calculating a suite of indices used
		for quantifying dynamic interaction with wildlife telemetry
		data. For more information on each of the methods employed see
		the references within. The package (as of version = 0.3) also
		has new tools for automating contact analysis in large tracking
		datasets. The package (as of version 1.0) uses the 'move2'
		class of objects for working with tracking dataset.
