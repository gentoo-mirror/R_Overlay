		Calculate Indices of Dynamic Interaction for Wildlife Tracking
		Data // Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal
		associations in the movements of two (or more) animals. This
		package provides tools for calculating a suite of indices used
		for quantifying dynamic interaction with wildlife telemetry
		data. For more information on each of the methods employed see
		the references within. The package (as of version 0.3) also has
		new tools for automating contact analysis in large tracking
		datasets. The package draws heavily on the classes and methods
		developed in the 'adehabitat' packages.
