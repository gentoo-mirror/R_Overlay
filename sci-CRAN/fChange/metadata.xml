		Change Point Analysis in Functional Data // Change point
		estimation and detection methods for functional data are
		implemented using dimension reduction via functional principal
		component analysis and a fully-functional (norm-based) method.
		Detecting and dating structural breaks for both dependent and
		independent functional samples is illustrated along with some
		basic functional data generating processes.
