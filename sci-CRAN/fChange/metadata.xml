		Functional Change Point Detection and Analysis // Analyze
		functional data and its change points. Includes functionality
		to store and process data, summarize and validate assumptions,
		characterize and perform inference of change points, and
		provide visualizations. Data is stored as discretely collected
		observations without requiring the selection of basis
		functions. For more details see chapter 8 of Horvath and Rice
		(2024) doi:10.1007/978-3-031-51609-2. Additional papers are
		forthcoming. Focused works are also included in the
		documentation of corresponding functions.
