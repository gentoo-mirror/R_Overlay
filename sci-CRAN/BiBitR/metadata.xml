		R Wrapper for Java Implementation of BiBit // A simple R wrapper
		for the Java BiBit algorithm from "A biclustering algorithm for
		extracting bit-patterns from binary datasets" from Domingo et
		al. (2011) DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr464. An simple
		adaption for the BiBit algorithm which allows noise in the
		biclusters is also introduced as well as a function to guide
		the algorithm towards given (sub)patterns. Further, a workflow
		to derive noisy biclusters from discoverd larger column
		patterns is included as well.
