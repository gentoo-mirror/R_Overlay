		Interactive Dashboard for 'HIV' Data Visualization // An
		interactive 'Shiny' dashboard for visualizing and exploring key
		metrics related to HIV/AIDS, including prevalence, incidence,
		mortality, and treatment coverage. The dashboard is designed to
		work with a dataset containing specific columns with
		standardized names. These columns must be present in the input
		data for the app to function properly: year: Numeric year of
		the data (e.g. 2010, 2021); sex: Gender classification (e.g.
		Male, Female); age_group: Age bracket (e.g. 1524, 2534);
		hiv_prevalence: Estimated HIV prevalence percentage;
		hiv_incidence: Number of new HIV cases per year; aids_deaths:
		Total AIDS-related deaths; plhiv: Estimated number of people
		living with HIV; art_coverage: Percentage receiving
		antiretroviral therapy (ART); testing_coverage: HIV testing
		services coverage; causes: Description of likely HIV
		transmission cause (e.g. unprotected sex, drug use). The
		dataset structure must strictly follow this column naming
		convention for the dashboard to render correctly.
