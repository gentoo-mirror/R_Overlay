		Tools for Behavior Change Researchers and Professionals //
		Contains specialised analyses and visualisation tools for
		behavior change science. These facilitate conducting
		determinant studies (for example, using confidence interval-
		based estimation of relevance, CIBER, or CIBERlite plots, see
		Crutzen, Noijen  Peters (2017) doi:10.3389/fpubh.2017.00165),
		systematically developing, reporting, and analysing
		interventions (for example, using Acyclic Behavior Change
		Diagrams), and reporting about intervention effectiveness (for
		example, using the Numbers Needed for Change, see Gruijters
		Peters (2017) doi:10.31234/osf.io/2bau7), and computing the
		required sample size (using the Meaningful Change Definition,
		see Gruijters  Peters (2019) doi:10.31234/osf.io/jc295). This
		package is especially useful for researchers in the field of
		behavior change or health psychology and to behavior change
		professionals such as intervention developers and prevention
		workers.
