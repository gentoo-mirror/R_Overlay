		Tools for Behavior Change Researchers and Professionals //
		Contains specialised analyses and visualisation tools for
		behavior change science. These facilitate conducting
		determinant studies (for example, using confidence interval-
		based estimation of relevance, CIBER, or CIBERlite plots),
		systematically developing, reporting, and analysing
		interventions (for example, using acyclic behavior change
		diagrams or ABCDs), and reporting about intervention
		effectiveness (for example, using the Numbers Needed for
		Change). This package is especially useful for researchers in
		the field of behavior change or health psychology and to
		behavior change professionals such as intervention developers
		and prevention workers.
