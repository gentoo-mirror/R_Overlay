		Shape Constrained Additive Models // Generalized additive models
		under shape constraints on the component functions of the
		linear predictor. Models can include multiple shape-constrained
		(univariate and bivariate) and unconstrained terms. Routines of
		the package 'mgcv' are used to set up the model matrix, print,
		and plot the results. Multiple smoothing parameter estimation
		by the Generalized Cross Validation or similar. See Pya and
		Wood (2015) doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9448-7 for an overview. A
		broad selection of shape-constrained smoothers, linear
		functionals of smooths with shape constraints, and Gaussian
		models with AR1 residuals.
