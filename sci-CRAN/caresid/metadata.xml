		Correspondence Analysis Plot and Associations Visualisation //
		Performs a Correspondence Analysis (CA) on a contingency table
		and creates a scatterplot of the row and column points on the
		selected dimensions. Optionally, the function can add segments
		to the plot to visualize significant associations between row
		and column categories on the basis of positive (unadjusted)
		standardized residuals larger than a given threshold.
