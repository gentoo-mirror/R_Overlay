		Multilevel/Mixed Model Helper Functions // A collection of
		miscellaneous helper function for running multilevel/mixed
		models in 'lme4'. This package aims to provide functions to
		compute common tasks when estimating multilevel models such as
		computing the intraclass correlation and design effect,
		centering variables, estimating the proportion of variance
		explained at each level, pseudo-R squared, random intercept and
		slope reliabilities, tests for homogeneity of variance at
		level-1, and cluster robust and bootstrap standard errors. The
		tests and statistics reported in the package are from
		Raudenbush  Bryk (2002, ISBN:9780761919049), Hox et al. (2018,
		ISBN:9781138121362), and Snijders  Bosker (2012,
		ISBN:9781849202015).
