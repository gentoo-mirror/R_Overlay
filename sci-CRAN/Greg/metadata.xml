		Regression Helper Functions // Methods for manipulating
		regression models and for describing these in a style adapted
		for medical journals. Contains functions for generating an HTML
		table with crude and adjusted estimates, plotting hazard ratio,
		plotting model estimates and confidence intervals using forest
		plots, extending this to comparing multiple models in a single
		forest plots. In addition to the descriptives methods, there
		are addons for the robust covariance matrix provided by the
		sandwich package, a function for adding non-linearities to a
		model, and a wrapper around the Epi package's Lexis functions
		for time-spliting a dataset when modeling non-proportional
		hazards in Cox regressions.
