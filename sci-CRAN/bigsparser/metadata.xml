		Sparse Matrix Format with Data on Disk // Provides a sparse
		matrix format with data stored on disk, to be used in both R
		and C++. This is intended for more efficient use of sparse data
		in C++ and also when parallelizing, since data on disk does not
		need copying. Only a limited number of features will be
		implemented. For now, conversion can be performed from a
		'dgCMatrix' or a 'dsCMatrix' from R package 'Matrix'. A new
		compact format is also now available.
