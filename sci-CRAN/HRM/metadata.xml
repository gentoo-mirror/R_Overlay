		High-Dimensional Repeated Measures // Methods for testing main
		and interaction effects in possibly high-dimensional parametric
		or nonparametric repeated measures in factorial designs. The
		observations of the subjects are assumed to be multivariate
		normal if using the parametric test. The nonparametric version
		tests with regard to nonparametric relative effects (based on
		pseudo-ranks). It is possible to use up to 2 whole- and 3
		subplot factors.
