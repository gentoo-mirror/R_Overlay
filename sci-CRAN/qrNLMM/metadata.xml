		Quantile Regression for Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Models //
		Quantile regression (QR) for Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Models via
		the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD). It uses the
		Stochastic Approximation of the EM (SAEM) algorithm for
		deriving exact maximum likelihood estimates and full inference
		results for the fixed-effects and variance components. It also
		provides prediction and graphical summaries for assessing the
		algorithm convergence and fitting results.
