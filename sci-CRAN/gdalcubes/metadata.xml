		Earth Observation Data Cubes from Satellite Image Collections //
		Processing collections of Earth observation images as on-demand
		multispectral, multitemporal raster data cubes. Users define
		cubes by spatiotemporal extent, resolution, and spatial
		reference system and let 'gdalcubes' automatically apply
		cropping, reprojection, and resampling using the 'Geospatial
		Data Abstraction Library' ('GDAL'). Implemented functions on
		data cubes include reduction over space and time, applying
		arithmetic expressions on pixel band values, moving window
		aggregates over time, filtering by space, time, bands, and
		predicates on pixel values, exporting data cubes as 'netCDF' or
		'GeoTIFF' files, plotting, and extraction from spatial and or
		spatiotemporal features. All computational parts are
		implemented in C++, linking to the 'GDAL', 'netCDF', 'CURL',
		and 'SQLite' libraries. See Appel and Pebesma (2019)
		doi:10.3390/data4030092 for further details.
