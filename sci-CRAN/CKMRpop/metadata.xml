		Forward-in-Time Simulation and Tallying of Pairwise Relationships
		// Provides an R wrapper around the program 'spip' (https://onl
		inelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2005.00884.x),
		a C program for the simulation of pedigrees within age-
		structured populations with user-specified life histories.
		Also includes a variety of functions to parse 'spip' output to
		compile information about related pairs amongst simulated,
		sampled individuals, to assess the feasibility and potential
		accuracy of close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR). Full documentation
		and vignettes are mirrored at
		https://eriqande.github.io/CKMRpop/index.html and can be read
		online there.
