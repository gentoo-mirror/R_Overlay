		Calculation of Covariance Between Markers for Half-Sib Families
		// The theoretical covariance between pairs of markers is
		calculated from either paternal haplotypes and maternal linkage
		disequilibrium (LD) or vise versa. A genetic map is required.
		Grouping of markers is based on the correlation matrix and a
		representative marker is suggested for each group. The
		implementation relies on paternal half-sib families and
		biallelic markers. If maternal half-sib families are used, the
		roles of sire/dam are swapped. Multiple families can be
		considered. Wittenburg, Bonk, Doschoris, Reyer (2019) "Design
