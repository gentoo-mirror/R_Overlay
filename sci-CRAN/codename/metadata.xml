		Generation of Code Names for Organizations, People, Projects, and
		Whatever Else // This creates code names that a user can
		consider for their organizations, their projects, themselves,
		people in their organizations or projects, or whatever else.
		The user can also supply a numeric seed (and even a character
		seed) for maximum reproducibility. Use is simple and the code
		names produced come in various types too, contingent on what
		the user may be desiring as a code name or nickname.
