		Global Sensitivity Analysis in Physiologically Based Kinetic
		Modeling // Applying the global sensitivity analysis workflow
		to investigate the parameter uncertainty and sensitivity in
		physiologically based kinetic (PK) models, especially the
		physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic model with
		multivariate outputs. The package also provides some functions
		to check the convergence and sensitivity of model parameters.
		The workflow was first mentioned in Hsieh et al., (2018)
		doi:10.3389/fphar.2018.00588, then further refined (Hsieh et
		al., 2020 doi:10.1016/j.softx.2020.100609).
