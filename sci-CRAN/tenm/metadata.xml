		Temporal Ecological Niche Models // Implements methods and
		functions to calibrate time-specific niche models (multi-
		temporal calibration), letting users execute a strict
		calibration and selection process of niche models based on
		ellipsoids, as well as functions to project the potential
		distribution in the present and in global change  scenarios.The
		'tenm' package has functions to recover information that may be
		lost or overlooked while applying a data curation protocol.
		This curation involves preserving occurrences that may appear
		spatially redundant (occurring in the same pixel) but originate
		from different time periods. A novel aspect of this package is
		that it might reconstruct the fundamental niche more accurately
		than mono-calibrated approaches. The theoretical background of
		the package can be found in Peterson et al.
