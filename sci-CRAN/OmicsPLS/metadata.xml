		Perform Two-Way Orthogonal Partial Least Squares // Performs the
		O2PLS data integration method for two datasets yielding joint
		and data-specific parts for each dataset. The algorithm
		automatically switches to a memory-efficient approach to fit
		O2PLS to high dimensional data. It provides a rigorous and a
		faster alternative cross-validation method to select the number
		of components, as well as functions to report proportions of
		explained variation and to construct plots of the results. See
		Trygg and Wold (2003) doi:10.1002/cem.775 and el Bouhaddani et
		al (2016) doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0854-z.
