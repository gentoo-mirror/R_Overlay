		Data Integration with Two-Way Orthogonal Partial Least Squares //
		Performs the O2PLS data integration method for two datasets
		yielding joint and data-specific parts for each dataset. The
		algorithm automatically switches to a memory-efficient approach
		to fit O2PLS to high dimensional data. It provides a rigorous
		and a faster alternative cross-validation method to select the
		number of components, as well as functions to report
		proportions of explained variation and to construct plots of
		the results. See the software article by el Bouhaddani et al
		(2018) doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2371-3, and Trygg and Wold (2003)
		doi:10.1002/cem.775.
