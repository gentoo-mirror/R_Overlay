		A Very Efficient Implementation of Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps
		(SOMs) with Starburst Visualizations // Kohonen's self-
		organizing maps with a number of distinguishing features: (1) A
		very efficient, single threaded, stochastic training algorithm
		based on ideas from tensor algebra.  Up to 60x faster than
		traditional single-threaded training algorithms. No special
		accelerator hardware required. (2) Automatic centroid detection
		and visualization using starbursts. (3) Two models of the data:
		(a) a self-organizing map model, (b) a centroid based
		clustering model. (4) A number of easily accessible quality
		metrics for the self-organizing map and the centroid based
		cluster model.
