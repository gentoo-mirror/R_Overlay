		Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Multinomial Proportions
		According to the Method by Sison and Glaz // An implementation
		of a method for building simultaneous confidence intervals for
		the probabilities of a multinomial distribution given a set of
		observations, proposed by Sison and Glaz in their paper: Sison,
		C.P and J. Glaz. Simultaneous confidence intervals and sample
		size determination for multinomial proportions. Journal of the
		American Statistical Association, 90:366-369 (1995). The method
		is an R translation of the SAS code implemented by May and
		Johnson in their paper: May, W.L. and W.D. Johnson.
		Constructing two-sided simultaneous confidence intervals for
		multinomial proportions for small counts in a large number of
		cells. Journal of Statistical Software 5(6) (2000). Paper and
		code available at DOI:10.18637/jss.v005.i06.
