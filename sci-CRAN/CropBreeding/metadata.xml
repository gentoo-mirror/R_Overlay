		Stability Analysis in Crop Breeding // Provides tools for crop
		breeding analysis including Genetic Coefficient of Variation
		(GCV), Phenotypic Coefficient of Variation (PCV), heritability,
		genetic advance calculations, stability analysis using the
		Eberhart-Russell model, two-way ANOVA for genotype-environment
		interactions, and Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative
		Interaction (AMMI) analysis. These tools are developed for crop
		breeding research and stability evaluation under various
		environmental conditions. The methods are based on established
		statistical and biometrical principles. Refer to Eberhart and
		Russell (1966) doi:10.2135/cropsci1966.0011183X000600010011x
		for stability parameters, Fisher (1935) "The Design of
		Experiments" ISBN:9780198522294, Falconer (1996) "Introduction
		to Quantitative Genetics" ISBN:9780582243026, and Singh and
		Chaudhary (1985) "Biometrical Methods in Quantitative Genetic
		Analysis" ISBN:9788122433764 for foundational methodologies.
