		False Discovery Exceedance Controlling Multiple Testing
		Procedures // Multiple testing procedures for heterogeneous and
		discrete tests as described in Dhler and Roquain (2020)
		doi:10.1214/20-EJS1771. The main algorithms of the paper are
		available as continuous, discrete and weighted versions. They
		take as input the results of a test procedure from package
		'DiscreteTests', or a set of observed p-values and their
		discrete support under their nulls. A shortcut function to
		obtain such p-values and supports is also provided, along with
		wrappers allowing to apply discrete procedures directly to
		data.
