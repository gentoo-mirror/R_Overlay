		Tools for Modelling of Animal Flight Performance // Allows
		estimation and modelling of flight costs in animal (vertebrate)
		flight, implementing the aerodynamic power model described in
		Klein Heerenbrink et al. (2015) doi:10.1098/rspa.2014.0952.
		Taking inspiration from the program 'Flight', developed by
		Colin Pennycuick (Pennycuick (2008) "Modelling the flying
		bird". Amsterdam: Elsevier. ISBN 0-19-857721-4), flight
		performance is estimated based on basic morphological
		measurements such as body mass, wingspan and wing area. 'afpt'
		can be used to make predictions on how animals should adjust
		their flight behaviour and wingbeat kinematics to varying
		flight conditions.
