		Select Sparse Geoadditive Models for Spatial Prediction // A
		model building procedure to build parsimonious geoadditive
		model from a large number of covariates. Continuous, binary and
		ordered categorical responses are supported. The model building
		is based on component wise gradient boosting with linear
		effects, smoothing splines and a smooth spatial surface to
		model spatial autocorrelation. The resulting covariate set
		after gradient boosting is further reduced through backward
		elimination and aggregation of factor levels. The package
		provides a model based bootstrap method to simulate prediction
		intervals for point predictions. A test data set of a soil
		mapping case study in Berne (Switzerland) is provided.
