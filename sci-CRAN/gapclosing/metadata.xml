		Estimate Gaps Under an Intervention // Provides functions to
		estimate the disparities across categories (e.g. Black and
		white) that persists if a treatment variable (e.g. college) is
		equalized. Makes estimates by treatment modeling, outcome
		modeling, and doubly-robust augmented inverse probability
		weighting estimation, with standard errors calculated by a
		nonparametric bootstrap. Cross-fitting is supported. Survey
		weights are supported for point estimation but not for standard
		error estimation; those applying this package with complex
		survey samples should consult the data distributor to select an
		appropriate approach for standard error construction, which may
		involve calling the functions repeatedly for many sets of
		replicate weights provided by the data distributor. The methods
		in this package are described in Lundberg (2021)
