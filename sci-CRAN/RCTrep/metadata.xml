		Validation of Estimates of Treatment Effects in Observational
		Data // Validates estimates of (conditional) average treatment
		effects obtained using observational data by a) making it easy
		to obtain and visualize estimates derived using a large variety
		of methods (G-computation, inverse propensity score weighting,
		etc.), and b) ensuring that estimates are easily compared to a
		gold standard (i.e., estimates derived from randomized
		controlled trials). 'RCTrep' offers a generic protocol for
		treatment effect validation based on four simple steps, namely,
		set-selection, estimation, diagnosis, and validation. 'RCTrep'
		provides a simple dashboard to review the obtained results. The
		validation approach is introduced by Shen, L., Geleijnse, G.
		and Kaptein, M. (2023) doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-2559287/v2.
