		Empirical Bayes Estimation Strategies // Empirical Bayes methods
		for learning prior distributions from data. An unknown prior
		distribution (g) has yielded (unobservable) parameters, each of
		which produces a data point from a parametric exponential
		family (f). The goal is to estimate the unknown prior
		("g-modeling") by deconvolution and Empirical Bayes methods.
		Details and examples are in the paper by Narasimhan and Efron
		(2020, doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i11).
