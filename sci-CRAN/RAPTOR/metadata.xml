		Row and Position Tracheid Organizer // Performs wood cell
		anatomical data analyses on spatially explicit xylem
		(tracheids) datasets derived from thin sections of woody
		tissue. The package includes functions for visualisation,
		detection and alignment of continuous tracheid radial file
		(defined as rows) and individual tracheid position within an
		annual ring of coniferous species. This package is designed to
		be used with elaborate cell output, e.g. as provided with ROXAS
		(von Arx  Carrer, 2014 doi:10.1016/j.dendro.2013.12.001). The
		package has been validated for Picea abies, Larix Siberica,
		Pinus cembra and Pinus sylvestris.
