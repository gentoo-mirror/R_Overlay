		High-Dimensional Variable Selection with Presence-Only Data //
		Efficient algorithm for solving PU (Positive and Unlabeled)
		problem in low or high dimensional setting with lasso or group
		lasso penalty. The algorithm uses Maximization-Minorization and
		(block) coordinate descent. Sparse calculation and parallel
		computing are supported for the computational speed-up. See
		Hyebin Song, Garvesh Raskutti (2018) arXiv:1711.08129.
