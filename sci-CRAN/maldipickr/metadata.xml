		Dereplicate and Cherry-Pick Mass Spectrometry Spectra //
		Convenient wrapper functions for the analysis of matrix-
		assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
		spectra data in order to select only representative spectra
		(also called cherry-pick). The package covers the preprocessing
		and dereplication steps (based on Strejcek, Smrhova, Junkova
		and Uhlik (2018) doi:10.3389/fmicb.2018.01294) needed to
		cluster MALDI-TOF spectra before the final cherry-picking step.
		It enables the easy exclusion of spectra and/or clusters to
		accommodate complex cherry-picking strategies. Alternatively,
		cherry-picking using taxonomic identification MALDI-TOF data is
		made easy with functions to import inconsistently formatted
		reports.
