		Reinsurance Treaties Application // Application of reinsurance
		treaties to claims portfolios. The package creates a class
		Claims whose objective is to store claims and premiums, on
		which different treaties can be applied. A statistical analysis
		can then be applied to measure the impact of reinsurance,
		producing a table or graphical output. This package can be used
		for estimating the impact of reinsurance on several portfolios
		or for pricing treaties through statistical analysis.
		Documentation for the implemented methods can be found in
		"Reinsurance: Actuarial and Statistical Aspects" by Hansjerg
		Albrecher, Jan Beirlant, Jozef L. Teugels (2017, ISBN:
		978-0-470-77268-3) and "REINSURANCE: A Basic Guide to
		Facultative and Treaty Reinsurance" by Munich Re (2010) https:/
