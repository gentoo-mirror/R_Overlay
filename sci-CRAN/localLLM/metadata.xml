		Running Local LLMs with 'llama.cpp' Backend // The 'localLLM'
		package provides R bindings to the 'llama.cpp' library for
		running large language models. The package uses a lightweight
		architecture where the C++ backend library is downloaded at
		runtime rather than bundled with the package. Package features
		include text generation, reproducible generation, and parallel
		inference.
