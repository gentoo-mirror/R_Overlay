		Weighted Inbred Strain Association Mapping // In the course of a
		genome-wide association study, the situation often arises that
		some phenotypes are known with greater precision than others.
		It could be that some individuals are known to harbor more
		micro-environmental variance than others. In the case of inbred
		strains of model organisms, it could be the case that more
		organisms were observed from some strains than others, so the
		strains with more organisms have better-estimated means.
		Package 'wISAM' handles this situation by allowing for
		weighting of each observation according to residual variance.
		Specifically, the 'weight' parameter to the function
		conduct_scan() takes the precision of each observation (one
		over the variance).
