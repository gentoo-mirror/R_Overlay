		Self-Organising Maps Coupled with Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
		// Implements self-organising maps combined with hierarchical
		cluster analysis (SOM-HCA) for clustering and visualization of
		high-dimensional data. The package includes functions to
		estimate the optimal map size based on various quality measures
		and to generate a model using the selected dimensions. It also
		performs hierarchical clustering on the map nodes to group
		similar units. Documentation about the SOM-HCA method is
		provided in Pastorelli et al. (2024) doi:10.1002/xrs.3388.
