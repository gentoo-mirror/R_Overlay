		Score Taxon-Level IgA Binding in IgA-Seq Experiments // Functions
		to calculate indices used to score immunoglobulin A (IgA)
		binding of bacteria in IgA sequencing (IgA-Seq) experiments.
		This includes the original Kau and Palm indices and more recent
		methods as described in Jackson et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1101/2020.08.19.257501. Additionally the package
