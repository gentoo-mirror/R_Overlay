		Compare and Verify File Contents // Extendable 'R6' file
		comparison classes, including a 'shiny' app for combining the
		comparison functionality into a file comparison application.
		The package idea originates from pharma companies' drug
		development processes, where statisticians and statistical
		programmers need to review and compare different versions of
		the same outputs and datasets. The package implementation
		itself is not tied to any specific industry and can be used in
		any context for easy file comparisons between different file
		version sets.
