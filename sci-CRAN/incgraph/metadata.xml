		Incremental Graphlet Counting for Network Optimisation // An
		efficient and incremental approach for calculating the
		differences in orbit counts when performing single edge
		modifications in a network. Calculating the differences in
		orbit counts is much more efficient than recalculating all
		orbit counts from scratch for each time point.
