		Power and Sample Size Calculation Tools // Statistical power and
		minimum required sample size calculations for  (1) testing a
		proportion (one-sample) against a constant,  (2) testing a mean
		(one-sample) against a constant,  (3) testing difference
		between two proportions (independent samples),  (4) testing
		difference between two means (independent and paired samples),
		(5) testing a correlation (one-sample) against a constant,  (6)
		testing difference between two correlations (independent
		samples),  (7) testing an R-squared against zero in linear
		regression, (8) testing an R-squared difference against zero in
		hierarchical regression,  (9) testing an eta-squared or
		f-squared (for main and interaction effects) against zero in
		analysis of variance (could be one-way, two-way, and three-
		way),  (10) testing an eta-squared or f-squared (for main and
		interaction effects) against zero in analysis of covariance
		(could be one-way, two-way, and three-way),  (11) testing an
		eta-squared or f-squared (for between, within, and interaction
		effects) against zero in one-way repeated measures analysis of
		variance (with non-sphericity correction and repeated measures
		correlation). Alternative hypothesis can be formulated as "not
		equal", "less", "greater", "non-inferior", "superior", or
		"equivalent" in (1), (2), (3), and (4); as "not equal", "less",
		or "greater" in (5) and (6); but always as "greater" in (7),
		(8), (9), (10), and (11). Reference: Bulus  Polat (2022)
