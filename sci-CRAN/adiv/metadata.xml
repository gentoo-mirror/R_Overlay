		Analysis of Diversity // Functions, data sets and examples for
		the calculation of various indices of biodiversity including
		species, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Part of the
		indices are expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of
		species. The package also provides ways to partition
		biodiversity across spatial or temporal scales (alpha, beta,
		gamma diversities). In addition to the quantification of
		biodiversity, ordination approaches are available which rely on
		diversity indices and allow the detailed identification of
		species, functional or phylogenetic differences between
		communities.
