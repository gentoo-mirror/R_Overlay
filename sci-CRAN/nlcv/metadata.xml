		Nested Loop Cross Validation // Nested loop cross validation for
		classification purposes for misclassification error rate
		estimation. The package supports several methodologies for
		feature selection: random forest, Student t-test, limma, and
		provides an interface to the following classification methods
		in the 'MLInterfaces' package: linear, quadratic discriminant
		analyses, random forest, bagging, prediction analysis for
		microarray, generalized linear model, support vector machine
		(svm and ksvm). Visualizations to assess the quality of the
		classifier are included: plot of the ranks of the features,
		scores plot for a specific classification algorithm and number
		of features, misclassification rate for the different number of
		features and classification algorithms tested and ROC plot. For
		further details about the methodology, please check: Markus
		Ruschhaupt, Wolfgang Huber, Annemarie Poustka, and Ulrich
		Mansmann (2004) doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1078.
