		Verification for Continually Updating Time Series Data //
		Verification of continually updating time series data where we
		expect new values, but want to ensure previous data remains
		unchanged. Data previously recorded could change for a number
		of reasons, such as discovery of an error in model code, a
		change in methodology or instrument recalibration. Monitoring
		data sources for these changes is not always possible. Other
		unnoticed changes could include a jump in time or measurement
		frequency, due to instrument failure or software updates.
		Functionality is provided that can be used to check and flag
		changes to previous data to prevent changes going unnoticed, as
		well as unexpected jumps in time.
