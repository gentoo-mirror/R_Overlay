		Perform a Partition of Variance of Reaction Norms // Partitions
		the phenotypic variance of a plastic trait, studied through its
		reaction norm. The variance partition distinguishes between the
		variance arising from the average shape of the reaction norms
		(V_Plas) and the (additive) genetic variance . The latter is
		itself separated into an environment-blind component (V_G/V_A)
		and the component arising from plasticity (V_GxE/V_AxE). The
		package also provides a way to further partition V_Plas into
		aspects (slope/curvature) of the shape of the average reaction
		norm (pi-decomposition) and partition V_Add (gamma-
		decomposition) and V_AxE (iota-decomposition) into the impact
		of genetic variation in the reaction norm parameters.
