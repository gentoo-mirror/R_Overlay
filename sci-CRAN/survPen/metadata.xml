		Multidimensional Penalized Splines for Survival and Net Survival
		Models // Fits hazard and excess hazard models with
		multidimensional penalized splines allowing for time-dependent
		effects, non-linear effects and interactions between several
		continuous covariates. In survival and net survival analysis,
		in addition to modelling the effect of time (via the baseline
		hazard), one has often to deal with several continuous
		covariates and model their functional forms, their time-
		dependent effects, and their interactions. Model specification
		becomes therefore a complex problem and penalized regression
		splines represent an appealing solution to that problem as
		splines offer the required flexibility while penalization
		limits overfitting issues. Current implementations of penalized
		survival models can be slow or unstable and sometimes lack some
		key features like taking into account expected mortality to
		provide net survival and excess hazard estimates. In contrast,
		survPen provides an automated, fast, and stable implementation
		(thanks to explicit calculation of the derivatives of the
		likelihood) and offers a unified framework for multidimensional
		penalized hazard and excess hazard models. survPen may be of
		interest to those who 1) analyse any kind of time-to-event
		data: mortality, disease relapse, machinery breakdown,
		unemployment, etc 2) wish to describe the associated hazard and
		to understand which predictors impact its dynamics. See
		Fauvernier et al. (2019a) doi:10.21105/joss.01434 for an
		overview of the package and Fauvernier et al. (2019b)
		doi:10.1111/rssc.12368 for the method.
