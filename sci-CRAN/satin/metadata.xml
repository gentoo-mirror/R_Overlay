		Visualisation and Analysis of Ocean Data Derived from Satellites
		// With 'satin' functions, visualisation, data extraction and
		further analysis like producing climatologies from several
		images, and anomalies of satellite derived ocean data can be
		easily done.  Reading functions can import a user defined
		geographical extent of data stored in netCDF files.  Currently
		supported ocean data sources include NASA's Oceancolor web page
		https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/, sensors VIIRS-SNPP; MODIS-
		Terra; MODIS-Aqua; and SeaWiFS.  Available variables from this
		source includes chlorophyll concentration, sea surface
		temperature (SST), and several others.  Data sources specific
		for SST that can be imported too includes Pathfinder AVHRR
		https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/avhrr-pathfinder-sst and
		GHRSST https://www.ghrsst.org/.  In addition, ocean
		productivity data produced by Oregon State University
		http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/ can
		also be handled previous conversion from HDF4 to HDF5 format.
		Many other ocean variables can be processed by importing netCDF
		data files from two European Union's Copernicus Marine Service
		databases https://marine.copernicus.eu/, namely Global Ocean
		Physical Reanalysis and Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Hindcast.
