		Spatial Subsampling of Biodiversity Occurrence Data // Divide
		taxonomic occurrence data into geographic regions of fair
		comparison, with three customisable methods to standardise area
		and extent. Calculate common biodiversity and range-size
		metrics on subsampled data. Background theory and practical
		considerations for the methods are described in Antell and
		others (2024) doi:10.1017/pab.2023.36.
