		Model Classifier for Binary Classification // A collection of
		tools that support data splitting, predictive modeling, and
		model evaluation. A typical function is to split a dataset into
		a training dataset and a test dataset. Then compare the data
		distribution of the two datasets. Another feature is to support
		the development of predictive models and to compare the
		performance of several predictive models, helping to select the
		best model.
