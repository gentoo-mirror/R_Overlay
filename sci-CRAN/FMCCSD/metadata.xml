		Efficient Estimation of Clustered Current Status Data // Current
		status data abounds in the field of epidemiology and public
		health, where the only observable data for a subject is the
		random inspection time and the event status at inspection.
		Motivated by such a current status data from a periodontal
		study where data are inherently clustered, we propose a unified
		methodology to analyze such complex data.
