		Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens // David
		Onstad provided us with this insect disease database, sometimes
		referred to as the 'Ecological Database of the Worlds Insect
		Pathogens' or EDWIP. Files have been converted from 'SQL' to
		csv, and ported into 'R' for easy exploration and analysis.
		Thanks to the Macroecology of Infectious Disease Research
		Coordination Network (RCN) for funding and support. Data are
		also served online in a static format at
		https://edwip.ecology.uga.edu/.
