		High Dimensional Bayesian Mediation Analysis // Perform mediation
		analysis in the presence of high-dimensional mediators based on
		the potential outcome framework. Bayesian Mediation Analysis
		(BAMA), developed by Song et al (2019) doi:10.1111/biom.13189
		and Song et al (2020) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2009.11409, relies on
		two Bayesian sparse linear mixed models to simultaneously
		analyze a relatively large number of mediators for a continuous
		exposure and outcome assuming a small number of mediators are
		truly active. This sparsity assumption also allows the
		extension of univariate mediator analysis by casting the
		identification of active mediators as a variable selection
		problem and applying Bayesian methods with continuous shrinkage
		priors on the effects.
