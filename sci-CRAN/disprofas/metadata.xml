		Non-Parametric Dissolution Profile Analysis // Similarity of
		dissolution profiles is assessed using the similarity factor f2
		according to the EMA guideline (European Medicines Agency 2010)
		"On the investigation of bioequivalence". Dissolution profiles
		are regarded as similar if the f2 value is between 50 and 100.
		For the applicability of the similarity factor f2, the
		variability between profiles needs to be within certain limits.
		Often, this constraint is violated. One possibility in this
		situation is to resample the measured profiles in order to
		obtain a bootstrap estimate of f2 (Shah et al. (1998)
		doi:10.1023/A:1011976615750). Other alternatives are the model-
		independent non-parametric multivariate confidence region (MCR)
		procedure (Tsong et al. (1996) doi:10.1177/009286159603000427)
		or the T2-test for equivalence procedure (Hoffelder (2016)
		https://www.ecv.de/suse_item.php?suseId=Z|pi|8430). Functions
		for estimation of f1, f2, bootstrap f2, MCR / T2-test for
		equivalence procedure are implemented.
