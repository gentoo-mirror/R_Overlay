		Neighborhood Deprivation Indices // Computes various geospatial
		indices of socioeconomic deprivation and disparity in the
		United States. Some indices are considered "spatial" because
		they consider the values of neighboring (i.e., adjacent) census
		geographies in their computation, while other indices are
		"aspatial" because they only consider the value within each
		census geography. Two types of aspatial neighborhood
		deprivation indices (NDI) are available: including: (1) based
		on Messer et al. (2006) doi:10.1007/s11524-006-9094-x and (2)
		based on Andrews et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1080/17445647.2020.1750066 and Slotman et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.dib.2022.108002 who use variables chosen by Roux
		and Mair (2010) doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05333.x. Both are
		a decomposition of multiple demographic characteristics from
		the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 5-year
		estimates (ACS-5; 2006-2010 onward). Using data from the ACS-5
		(2005-2009 onward), the package can also compute indices of
		racial or ethnic residential segregation, including but limited
		to those discussed in Massey  Denton (1988)
		doi:10.1093/sf/67.2.281, and additional indices of
		socioeconomic disparity.
