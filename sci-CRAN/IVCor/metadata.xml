		A Robust Integrated Variance Correlation // A integrated variance
		correlation is proposed to measure the dependence between a
		categorical or continuous random variable and a continuous
		random variable or vector. This package is designed to estimate
		the new correlation coefficient with parametric and
		nonparametric approaches. Test of independence for different
		problems can also be implemented via the new correlation
		coefficient with this package.
