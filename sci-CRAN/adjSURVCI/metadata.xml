		Parameter and Adjusted Probability Estimation for Right-Censored
		Data // Functions in this package fit a stratified Cox
		proportional hazards and a proportional subdistribution hazards
		model by extending Zhang et al., (2007) doi:
		10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.07.010 and Zhang et al., (2011) doi:
		10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.07.005 respectively to clustered right-
		censored data. The functions also provide the estimates of the
		cumulative baseline hazard along with their standard errors.
		Furthermore, the adjusted survival and cumulative incidence
		probabilities are also provided along with their standard
		errors. Finally, the estimate of cumulative incidence and
		survival probabilities given a vector of covariates along with
		their standard errors are also provided.
