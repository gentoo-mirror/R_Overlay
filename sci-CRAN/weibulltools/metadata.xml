		Statistical Methods for Life Data Analysis // Provides
		statistical methods and visualizations that are often used in
		reliability engineering. Comprises a compact and easily
		accessible set of methods and visualization tools that make the
		examination and adjustment as well as the analysis and
		interpretation of field data (and bench tests) as simple as
		possible. Non-parametric estimators like Median Ranks, Kaplan-
		Meier (Abernethy, 2006, ISBN:978-0-9653062-3-2), Johnson
		(Johnson, 1964, ISBN:978-0444403223), and Nelson-Aalen for
		failure probability estimation within samples that contain
		failures as well as censored data are included. The package
		supports methods like Maximum Likelihood and Rank Regression,
		(Genschel and Meeker, 2010, DOI:10.1080/08982112.2010.503447)
		for the estimation of multiple parametric lifetime
		distributions, as well as the computation of confidence
		intervals of quantiles and probabilities using the delta method
		related to Fisher's confidence intervals (Meeker and Escobar,
		1998, ISBN:9780471673279) and the beta-binomial confidence
		bounds. If desired, mixture model analysis can be done with
		segmented regression and the EM algorithm. Besides the well-
		known Weibull analysis, the package also contains Monte Carlo
		methods for the correction and completion of imprecisely
		recorded or unknown lifetime characteristics. (Verband der
		Automobilindustrie e.V. (VDA), 2016, ISSN:0943-9412). Plots are
		created statically ('ggplot2') or interactively ('plotly') and
		can be customized with functions of the respective
		visualization package. The graphical technique of probability
		plotting as well as the addition of regression lines and
		confidence bounds to existing plots are supported.
