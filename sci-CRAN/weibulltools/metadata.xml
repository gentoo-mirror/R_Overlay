		Statistical Methods for Life Data Analysis // Contains methods
		for examining bench test or field data using the well-known
		Weibull Analysis. It includes Monte Carlo simulation for
		estimating the life span of products that have not failed,
		taking account of registering and reporting delays as stated in
		(Verband der Automobilindustrie e.V. (VDA), 2016,
		ISSN:0943-9412). If the products looked upon are vehicles, the
		covered mileage can be estimated as well. It also provides non-
		parametric estimators like Median Ranks, Kaplan-Meier
		(Abernethy, 2006, ISBN:978-0-9653062-3-2), Johnson (Johnson,
		1964, ISBN:978-0444403223), and Nelson-Aalen for failure
		probability estimation within samples that contain failures as
		well as censored data. Methods for estimating the parameters of
		lifetime distributions, like Maximum Likelihood and Median-Rank
		Regression, (Genschel and Meeker, 2010,
		DOI:10.1080/08982112.2010.503447) as well as the computation of
		confidence intervals of quantiles and probabilities using the
		delta method related to Fisher's confidence intervals (Meeker
		and Escobar, 1998, ISBN:9780471673279) and the beta-binomial
		confidence bounds are also included. If desired, the data can
		automatically be divided into subgroups using segmented
		regression. And if the number of subgroups in a Weibull Mixture
		Model is known, data can be analyzed using the EM-Algorithm.
		Besides the calculation, methods for interactive visualization
		of the edited data using *plotly* are provided as well. These
		visualizations include the layout of a probability plot for a
		specified distribution, the graphical technique of probability
		plotting and the possibility of adding regression lines and
		confidence bounds to existing plots.
