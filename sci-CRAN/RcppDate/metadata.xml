		'date' C++ Header Library for Date and Time Functionality //
		'date' is a C++ header library offering extensive date and time
		functionality for the C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards written
		by Howard Hinnant and released under the MIT license. A
		slightly modified version has been accepted (along with 'tz.h')
		as part of C++20. This package regroups all header files from
		the upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that other R
		packages can use them in their C++ code. At present, few of the
		types have explicit 'Rcpp' wrapper though these may be added as
		needed.
