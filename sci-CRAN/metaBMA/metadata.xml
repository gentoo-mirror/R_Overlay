		Bayesian Model Averaging for Random and Fixed Effects Meta-
		Analysis // Computes the posterior model probabilities for
		standard meta-analysis models (null model vs. alternative model
		assuming either fixed- or random-effects, respectively). These
		posterior probabilities are used to estimate the overall mean
		effect size as the weighted average of the mean effect size
		estimates of the random- and fixed-effect model as proposed by
		Gronau, Van Erp, Heck, Cesario, Jonas,  Wagenmakers (2017,
		doi:10.1080/23743603.2017.1326760). The user can define a wide
		range of non-informative or informative priors for the mean
		effect size and the heterogeneity coefficient. Moreover, using
		pre-compiled Stan models, meta-analysis with continuous and
		discrete moderators with Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow (JZS) priors can
		be fitted and tested. This allows to compute Bayes factors and
		perform Bayesian model averaging across random- and fixed-
		effects meta-analysis with and without moderators. For a primer
		on Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis, see Gronau, Heck,
		Berkhout, Haaf,  Wagenmakers (2021,
		doi:10.1177/25152459211031256).
