		Bayesian Model Averaging for Random and Fixed Effects Meta-
		Analysis // Computes the posterior model probabilities for four
		meta-analysis models (null model vs. alternative model assuming
		either fixed- or random-effects, respectively). These posterior
		probabilities are used to estimate the overall mean effect size
		as the weighted average of the mean effect size estimates of
		the random- and fixed-effect model as proposed by Gronau, Van
		Erp, Heck, Cesario, Jonas,  Wagenmakers (2017,
		doi:10.1080/23743603.2017.1326760). The user can define a wide
		range of noninformative or informative priors for the mean
		effect size and the heterogeneity coefficient. Funding for this
		research was provided by the Berkeley Initiative for
		Transparency in the Social Sciences, a program of the Center
		for Effective Global Action (CEGA), with support from the Laura
		and John Arnold Foundation.
