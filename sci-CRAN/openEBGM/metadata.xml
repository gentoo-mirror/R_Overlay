		EBGM Scores for Mining Large Contingency Tables // An
		implementation of DuMouchel's (1999)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.1999.10474456 Bayesian data mining method
		for the market basket problem. Calculates Empirical Bayes
		Geometric Mean (EBGM) and quantile scores from the posterior
		distribution using the Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (GPS) model to
		find unusually large cell counts in large, sparse contingency
		tables. Can be used to find unusually high reporting rates of
		adverse events associated with products. In general, can be
		used to mine any database where the co-occurrence of two
		variables or items is of interest. Also calculates relative and
		proportional reporting ratios. Builds on the work of the
		'PhViD' package, from which much of the code is derived. Some
		of the added features include stratification to adjust for
		confounding variables and data squashing to improve
		computational efficiency.
