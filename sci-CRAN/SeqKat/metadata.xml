		Detection of Kataegis // Kataegis is a localized hypermutation
		occurring when a region is enriched in somatic SNVs. Kataegis
		can result from multiple cytosine deaminations catalyzed by the
		AID/APOBEC family of proteins. This package contains functions
		to detect kataegis from SNVs in BED format. SeqKat reports two
		scores per kataegic event, a hypermutation score and an APOBEC
		mediated kataegic score. Upon publication of the paper
		describing the methods used in this package, a reference will
		be added here.
