		Detection of Kataegis // Kataegis is a localized hypermutation
		occurring when a region is enriched in somatic SNVs. Kataegis
		can result from multiple cytosine deaminations catalyzed by the
		AID/APOBEC family of proteins. This package contains functions
		to detect kataegis from SNVs in BED format. This package
		reports two scores per kataegic event, a hypermutation score
		and an APOBEC mediated kataegic score. Yousif, F. et al.; The
		Origins and Consequences of Localized and Global Somatic
