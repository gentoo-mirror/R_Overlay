		'Rcpp' Integration of Additional Probability Distributions // The
		'Rcpp' package provides a C++ library to make it easier to use
		C++ with R. R and 'Rcpp' provide functions for a variety of
		statistical distributions. Several R packages make functions
		available to R for additional statistical distributions.
		However, to access these functions from C++ code, a costly call
		to the R functions must be made. 'RcppDist' provides a header-
		only C++ library with functions for additional statistical
		distributions that can be called from C++ when writing code
		using 'Rcpp' or 'RcppArmadillo'. Functions are available that
		return a 'NumericVector' as well as doubles, and for
		multivariate or matrix distributions, 'Armadillo' vectors and
		matrices. 'RcppDist' provides functions for the following
		distributions: the four parameter beta distribution; the
		location- scale t distribution; the truncated normal
		distribution; the truncated t distribution; a truncated
		location-scale t distribution; the triangle distribution; the
		multivariate normal distribution*; the multivariate t
		distribution*; the Wishart distribution*; and the inverse
		Wishart distribution*. Distributions marked with an asterisk
		rely on 'RcppArmadillo'.
