		Biogeographic Regionalization and Spatial Conservation //
		Computational infrastructure for biogeography, community
		ecology, and biodiversity conservation (Daru et al. 2020)
		doi:10.1101/2020.02.12.945691. It is based on the conceptual
		work in Daru et al.(2017) doi:10.1016/j.tree.2017.08.013 on
		patterns and processes of biogeographical regionalization.
		Additionally, the package contains fast and efficient functions
		to compute more standard conservation measures such as
		phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic endemism, evolutionary
		distinctiveness and global endangerment, as well as
		compositional turnover (e.g., beta diversity).
