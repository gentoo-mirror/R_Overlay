		Biogeographic Regionalization and Macroecology // Computational
		infrastructure for biogeography, community ecology, and
		biodiversity conservation (Daru et al. 2020)
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13478. It is based on the methods
		described in Daru et al. (2020) doi:10.1038/s41467-020-15921-6.
		The original conceptual work is described in Daru et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1016/j.tree.2017.08.013 on patterns and processes of
		biogeographical regionalization. Additionally, the package
		contains fast and efficient functions to compute more standard
		conservation measures such as phylogenetic diversity,
		phylogenetic endemism, evolutionary distinctiveness and global
		endangerment, as well as compositional turnover (e.g., beta
		diversity).
