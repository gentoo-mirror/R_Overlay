		Panel Treatment Effects Tools // Generic code for estimating
		treatment effects with panel data.  The idea is to break into
		separate steps organizing the data, looping over groups and
		time periods, computing group-time average treatment effects,
		and aggregating group-time average treatment effects.  Often,
		one is able to implement a new identification/estimation
		procedure by simply replacing the step on estimating group-time
		average treatment effects.  See several different examples of
		this approach in the package documentation.
