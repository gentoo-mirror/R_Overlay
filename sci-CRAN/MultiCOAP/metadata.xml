		High-Dimensional Covariate-Augmented Overdispersed Multi-Study
		Poisson Factor Model // We introduce factor models designed to
		jointly analyze high-dimensional count data from multiple
		studies by extracting study-shared and specified factors. Our
		factor models account for heterogeneous noises and
		overdispersion among counts with augmented covariates. We
		propose an efficient and speedy variational estimation
		procedure for estimating model parameters, along with a novel
		criterion for selecting the optimal number of factors and the
		rank of regression coefficient matrix. More details can be
		referred to Liu et al. (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2402.15071.
