		Translate ICD-9 into Injury Severity Score // Calculate the
		injury severity score (ISS) based on the dictionary in 'ICDPIC'
		from https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457028.html. The
		original code was written in 'STATA 11'. The original 'STATA'
		code was written by David Clark, Turner Osler and David Hahn. I
		implement the same logic for easier access. Ref: David E. Clark
