		Trait Specific Gene Selection using SVM and GA // Obtaining
		relevant set of trait specific genes from gene expression data
		is important for clinical diagnosis of disease and discovery of
		disease mechanisms in plants and animals. This process involves
		identification of relevant genes and removal of redundant genes
		as much as possible from a whole gene set. This package returns
		the trait specific gene set from the high dimensional RNA-seq
		count data by applying combination of two conventional machine
		learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and genetic
		algorithm (GA). GA is used to control and optimize the subset
		of genes sent to the SVM for classification and evaluation.
		Genetic algorithm uses repeated learning steps and cross
		validation over number of possible solution and selects the
		best. The algorithm selects the set of genes based on a fitness
		function that is obtained via support vector machines. Using
		SVM as the classifier performance and the genetic algorithm for
		feature selection, a set of trait specific gene set is
		obtained.
