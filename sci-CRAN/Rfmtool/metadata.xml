		Fuzzy Measure Tools // Various tools for handling fuzzy measures,
		calculating Shapley value and interaction index,  Choquet and
		Sugeno integrals, as well as fitting fuzzy measures to
		empirical data are provided. Construction of fuzzy measures
		from empirical data is done by solving a linear programming
		problem by using 'lpsolve' package, whose source in C adapted
		to the R environment is included. The description of the basic
		theory of fuzzy measures is in the manual in the Doc folder in
		this package. Please refer to the following: [1]
