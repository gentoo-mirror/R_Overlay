		Asynchronous Code Constructs: Generators, Yield, Async, Await //
		Write sequential-looking code that pauses and resumes. gen()
		creates a generator, an iterator that returns a value and
		pauses each time it reaches a yield() call. async() creates a
		promise, which runs until it reaches a call to await(), then
		resumes when information is available. These work similarly to
		generator and async constructs from 'Python' or 'JavaScript'.
		Objects produced are compatible with the 'iterators' and
		'promises' packages.
