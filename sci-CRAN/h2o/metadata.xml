		R Interface for the 'H2O' Scalable Machine Learning Platform // R
		interface for 'H2O', the scalable open source machine learning
		platform that offers parallelized implementations of many
		supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as
		Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Gradient Boosting Machines
		(including XGBoost), Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks (Deep
		Learning), Stacked Ensembles, Naive Bayes, Generalized Additive
		Models (GAM), ANOVA GLM, Cox Proportional Hazards, K-Means,
		PCA, Maximum R GLM (maxrglm), Word2Vec, as well as a fully
		automatic machine learning algorithm (H2O AutoML).
