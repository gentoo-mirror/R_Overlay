		R Interface for 'H2O' // R interface for 'H2O', the scalable open
		source machine learning platform that offers parallelized
		implementations of many supervised and unsupervised machine
		learning algorithms such as generalized linear models, gradient
		boosting machines (including xgboost), random forests, deep
		neural networks (deep learning), stacked ensembles, naive
		bayes, cox proportional hazards, k-means, PCA, word2vec, as
		well as a fully automatic machine learning algorithm (AutoML).
