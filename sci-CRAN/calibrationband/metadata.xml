		Calibration Bands // Package to assess the calibration of
		probabilistic classifiers using confidence bands for monotonic
		functions. Besides testing the classical goodness-of-fit null
		hypothesis of perfect calibration, the confidence bands
		calculated within that package facilitate inverted goodness-of-
		fit tests whose rejection allows for a sought-after conclusion
		of a sufficiently well-calibrated model. The package creates
		flexible graphical tools to perform these tests.  For
		construction details see also Dimitriadis, Dmbgen, Henzi, Puke,
		Ziegel (2022) arXiv:2203.04065.
