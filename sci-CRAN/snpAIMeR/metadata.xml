		Assess the Diagnostic Power of Genomic Marker Combinations //
		Population genetics package for designing diagnostic panels.
		Candidate markers, marker combinations, and different panel
		sizes are assessed for how well they can predict the source
		population of known samples. Requires a genotype file of
		candidate markers in STRUCTURE format. Methods for population
		cross-validation are described in Jombart (2008)
