		Nonparametric Modeling and Monitoring of Spatio-Temporal Data //
		Spatio-temporal data have become increasingly popular in many
		research fields. Such data often have complex structures that
		are difficult to describe and estimate. This package provides
		reliable tools for modeling complicated spatio-temporal data.
		It also includes tools of online process monitoring to detect
		possible change-points in a spatio-temporal process over time.
		More specifically, the package implements the spatio-temporal
		mean estimation procedure described in Yang and Qiu (2018)
		doi:10.1002/sim.7622, the spatio-temporal covariance estimation
		procedure discussed in Yang and Qiu (2019)
		doi:10.1002/sim.8315, the three-step method for the joint
		estimation of spatio-temporal mean and covariance functions
		suggested by Yang and Qiu (2022)
		doi:10.1007/s10463-021-00787-2, the spatio-temporal disease
		surveillance method discussed in Qiu and Yang (2021)
		doi:10.1002/sim.9150 that can accommodate the covariate effect,
		the spatial-LASSO-based process monitoring method proposed by
		Qiu and Yang (2023) doi:10.1080/00224065.2022.2081104, and the
		online spatio-temporal disease surveillance method described in
		Yang and Qiu (2020) doi:10.1080/24725854.2019.1696496.
