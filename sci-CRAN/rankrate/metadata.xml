		Statistical Tools for Preference Learning with Rankings and
		Ratings // An implementation of the statistical methodology
		proposed by Pearce and Erosheva, "A Unified Statistical
		Learning Model for Rankings and Scores with Application to
		Grant Panel Review" (2022), which at time of release has been
		accepted in the Journal of Machine Learning Research. The
		package provides tools for estimating parameters of a Mallows-
		Binomial model, the first joint statistical preference learning
		model for rankings and ratings. The package includes functions
		for simulating rankings and ratings from the model, calculating
		the density of Mallows-Binomial data, estimating parameters
		using various exact and approximate algorithms, and for
		obtaining approximate confidence intervals based on the
		nonparametric bootstrap.
