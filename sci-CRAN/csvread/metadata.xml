		Fast Specialized CSV File Loader // Functions for loading large
		(10M+ lines) CSV and other delimited files, similar to
		read.csv, but typically faster and using less memory than the
		standard R loader. While not entirely general, it covers many
		common use cases when the types of columns in the CSV file are
		known in advance. In addition, the package provides a class
		'int64', which represents 64-bit integers exactly when reading
		from a file. The latter is useful when working with 64-bit
		integer identifiers exported from databases. The CSV file
		loader supports common column types including 'integer',
		'double', 'string', and 'int64', leaving further type
		transformations  to the user.
