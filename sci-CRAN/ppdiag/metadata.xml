		Diagnosis and Visualizations Tools for Temporal Point Processes
		// A suite of diagnostic tools for univariate point processes.
		This includes tools for simulating and fitting both common and
		more complex temporal point processes. We also include
		functions to visualise these point processes and collect
		existing diagnostic tools of Brown et al. (2002)
		doi:10.1162/08997660252741149 and Wu et al. (2020)
		arxiv:2001.09359, which can be used to assess the fit of a
		chosen point process model.
