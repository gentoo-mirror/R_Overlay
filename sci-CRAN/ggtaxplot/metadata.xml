		Create Plots to Visualize Taxonomy // Provides a comprehensive
		suite of functions for processing and visualizing taxonomic
		data. It includes functionality to clean and transform
		taxonomic data, categorize it into hierarchical ranks (such as
		Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and Genus), and calculate the
		relative abundance of each category. The package also generates
		a color palette for visual representation of the taxonomic
		data, allowing users to easily identify and differentiate
		between various taxonomic groups. Additionally, it features a
		river plot visualization to effectively display the
		distribution of individuals across different taxonomic ranks,
		facilitating insights into taxonomic visualization.
