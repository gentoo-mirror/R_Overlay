		Automated Uncertainty Analysis // Methods and tools for model
		selection and multi-model inference (Burnham and Anderson
		(2002) doi:10.1007/b97636, among others). 'SUR' (for parameter
		estimation), 'logit'/'probit' (for binary classification), and
		'VARMA' (for time-series forecasting) are implemented.
		Evaluations are both in-sample and out-of-sample. It is
		designed to be efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory
		consumption.
