		Outputs Temporal Profile of Molecules Undergoing Stochastic
		Simulations // The data that is generated from consecutive
		'GillespieSSA' runs for a generic biochemical network is
		formatted as "rows". The first column of each row constitutes
		the computed timestep. Subsequent columns are used for the
		participating molecules of a generic biochemical network. In
		this way 'TemporalGSSA', may be considered a wrapper for the
		R-package 'GillespieSSA'. The number of observations must be at
		least 30. This will generate data that is statistically
		significant. The user must also enter an integer from 1-4.
		These specify the statistical modality utilized to compute a
		representative timestep (mean, median, random, all). These
		arguments are mandatory and will be checked. Whilst, the
		numeric indicator "0" indicates suitability, "1" prompts the
		user to revise and re-enter their data. An optional logical
		argument controls the output to the console with the default
		being "TRUE" (curtailed) whilst "FALSE" (verbose). The temporal
		profile of a molecule is necessary to comprehend its' behaviour
		within the cell. This is accomplished by selecting a
		representative timestep for a set of observations or
		consecutive runs (n = 30). A linear model of the numbers of
		each molecule is created with the associated timestep from
		these observations. The coefficients of this model (slope,
		constant) are then incorporated into a second linear regression
		model. Here, the independent variable is the representative
		timestep chosen previously. The generated data is the imputed
		molecule number for an in silico experiment with (n =30)
		observations. These steps can be replicated with multiple set
		of observations or runs. The generated "technical replicates"
		can be averaged and will constitute the time-dependent data
		point of each molecule for a particular simulation time. For
		varying simulation times these data will generate time-
		dependent trajectories for each molecule of the biochemical
		network under study. The algorithm has been deployed
		effectively in previous publications Kundu, S (2021, Heliyon)
		doi:10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07466 and (2016, Journal of
		Theoretical Biology) doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.07.002.
