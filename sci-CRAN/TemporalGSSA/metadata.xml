		Outputs Temporal Profile of Molecules from Stochastic Simulation
		Algorithm Generated Datasets // The data that is generated from
		independent and consecutive 'GillespieSSA' runs for a generic
		biochemical network is formatted as rows and constitutes an
		observation. The first column of each row is the computed
		timestep for each run. Subsequent columns are used for the
		number of molecules of each participating molecular species or
		"metabolite" of a generic biochemical network. In this way
		'TemporalGSSA', is a wrapper for the R-package 'GillespieSSA'.
		The number of observations must be at least 30. This will
		generate data that is statistically significant.
		'TemporalGSSA', transforms this raw data into a simulation
		time-dependent and metabolite-specific trial. Each such trial
		is defined as a set of linear models (n = 30) between a
		timestep and number of molecules for a metabolite. Each linear
		model is characterized by coefficients such as the slope,
		arbitrary constant, etc. The user must enter an integer from
		1-4. These specify the statistical modality utilized to compute
		a representative timestep (mean, median, random, all). These
		arguments are mandatory and will be checked. Whilst, the
		numeric indicator "0" indicates suitability, "1" prompts the
		user to revise and re-enter their data. An optional logical
		argument controls the output to the console with the default
		being "TRUE" (curtailed) whilst "FALSE" (verbose). The
		coefficients of each linear model are averaged (mean slope,
		mean constant) and are incorporated into a metabolite-specific
		linear regression model as the dependent variable. The
		independent variable is the representative timestep chosen
		previously. The generated data is the imputed molecule number
		for an in silico experiment with (n =30) observations. These
		steps can be replicated with multiple set of observations. The
		generated "technical replicates" can be statistically evaluated
		(mean, standard deviation) and will constitute simulation time-
		dependent molecules for each metabolite. For SSA-generated
		datasets with varying simulation times 'TemporalGSSA' will
		generate a simulation time-dependent trajectory for each
		metabolite of the biochemical network under study. The relevant
		publication with the mathematical derivation of the algorithm
		is (2022, Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology)
		doi:10.1142/S0219720022500184. The algorithm has been deployed
		in the following publications (2021, Heliyon)
		doi:10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07466 and (2016, Journal of
		Theoretical Biology) doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.07.002.
