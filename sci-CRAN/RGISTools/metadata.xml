		Handling Multiplatform Satellite Images // Downloading,
		customizing, and processing time series of satellite images for
		a region of interest. 'RGISTools' functions allow a unified
		access to multispectral images from Landsat, MODIS and Sentinel
		repositories. 'RGISTools' also offers capabilities for
		customizing satellite images, such as tile mosaicking and image
		cropping. Finally, 'RGISTools' covers the processing, including
		cloud masking, deriving new variables, and gap-
		filling/smoothing time series of images (Militino et al., 2018
		doi:10.3390/rs10030398 and Militino et al., 2019
		doi:10.1109/TGRS.2019.2904193).
