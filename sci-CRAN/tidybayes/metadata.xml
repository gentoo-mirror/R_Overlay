		Tidy Data and 'Geoms' for Bayesian Models // Compose data for and
		extract, manipulate, and visualize posterior draws from
		Bayesian models ('JAGS', 'Stan', 'rstanarm', 'brms',
		'MCMCglmm', 'coda', ...) in a tidy data format. Functions are
		provided to help extract tidy data frames of draws from
		Bayesian models and that generate point summaries and intervals
		in a tidy format. In addition, 'ggplot2' 'geoms' and 'stats'
		are provided for common visualization primitives like points
		with multiple uncertainty intervals, eye plots (intervals plus
		densities), and fit curves with multiple, arbitrary uncertainty
		bands.
