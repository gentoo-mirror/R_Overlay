		Automatic Processing of TLS Point Cloud Data for Forestry
		Purposes // Process automation of Terrestrial Laser Scanner
		(TLS) point cloud data derived from single scans. 'FORTLS'
		enables (i) detection of trees and estimation of diameter at
		breast height (dbh), (ii) estimation of some stand variables
		(e.g. density, basal area, mean and dominant height), (iii)
		computation of metrics related to important forest attributes
		estimated in Forest Inventories (FIs) at stand level and (iv)
		optimization of plot design for combining TLS data and field
		measured data. Documentation about 'FORTLS' is described in
		Molina-Valero et al. (2020, doi:10.3390/IECF2020-08003).
