		Automatic Processing of Terrestrial-Based Technologies Point
		Cloud Data for Forestry Purposes // Process automation of point
		cloud data derived from terrestrial-based technologies such as
		Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) or Mobile Laser Scanner.
		'FORTLS' enables (i) detection of trees and estimation of tree-
		level attributes (e.g. diameters and heights), (ii) estimation
		of stand-level variables (e.g. density, basal area, mean and
		dominant height), (iii) computation of metrics related to
		important forest attributes estimated in Forest Inventories at
		stand-level, and (iv) optimization of plot design for combining
		TLS data and field measured data. Documentation about 'FORTLS'
		is described in Molina-Valero et al. (2022,
		doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105337).
