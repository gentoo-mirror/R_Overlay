		Tools for Ordinary Differential Equations Model Fitting //
		Methods and functions for fitting ordinary differential
		equations (ODE) model in 'R'. Sensitivity equations are used to
		compute the gradients of ODE trajectories with respect to
		underlying parameters, which in turn allows for more stable
		fitting. Other fitting methods, such as MCMC (Markov chain
		Monte Carlo), are also available.
