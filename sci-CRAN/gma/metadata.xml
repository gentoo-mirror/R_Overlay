		Granger Mediation Analysis // Performs Granger mediation analysis
		(GMA) for time series. This package includes a single level GMA
		model and a two-level GMA model, for time series with
		hierarchically nested structure. The single level GMA model for
		the time series of a single participant performs the causal
		mediation analysis which integrates the structural equation
		modeling and the Granger causality frameworks. A vector
		autoregressive model of order p is employed to account for the
		spatiotemporal dependencies in the data. Meanwhile, the model
		introduces the unmeasured confounding effect through a nonzero
		correlation parameter. Under the two-level model, by leveraging
		the variabilities across participants, the parameters are
		identifiable and consistently estimated based on a full
		conditional likelihood or a two-stage method. See Zhao, Y.,
		Luo, X. (2017), Granger Mediation Analysis of Multiple Time
		Series with an Application to fMRI, arXiv:1709.05328 for
		details.
