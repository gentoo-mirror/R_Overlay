		Identifying Stocks in Genetic Data // Provides a mixture model
		for clustering individuals (or sampling groups) into stocks
		based on their genetic profile. Here, sampling groups are
		individuals that are sure to come from the same stock (e.g.
		breeding adults or larvae). The mixture (log-)likelihood is
		maximised using the EM-algorithm after find good starting
		values via a K-means clustering of the genetic data. Details
		can be found in Foster, Feutry, Grewe, Berry, Hui, Davies (in
		press) Reliably Discriminating Stock Structure with Genetic
		Markers: Mixture Models with Robust and Fast Computation.
