		Presence-Absence Model Evaluation // Provides a set of functions
		useful when evaluating the results of presence-absence models.
		Package includes functions for calculating threshold dependent
		measures such as confusion matrices, pcc, sensitivity,
		specificity, and Kappa, and produces plots of each measure as
		the threshold is varied. It will calculate optimal threshold
		choice according to a choice of optimization criteria. It also
		includes functions to plot the threshold independent ROC curves
		along with the associated AUC (area under the curve).
