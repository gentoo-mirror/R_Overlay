		Meta-Analysis via a Unified Framework of Confidence Distribution
		// An implementation of an all-in-one function for a wide range
		of meta-analysis problems. It contains three functions. The
		gmeta() function unifies all standard meta-analysis methods and
		also several newly developed ones under a framework of
		combining confidence distributions (CDs). Specifically, the
		package can perform classical p-value combination methods (such
		as methods of Fisher, Stouffer, Tippett, etc.), fit meta-
		analysis fixed-effect and random-effects models, and
		synthesizes 2x2 tables. Furthermore, it can perform robust
		meta-analysis, which provides protection against model-
		misspecifications, and limits the impact of any unknown
		outlying studies. In addition, the package implements two exact
		meta-analysis methods from synthesizing 2x2 tables with rare
		events (e.g., zero total event). The np.gmeta() function
		summarizes information obtained from multiple studies and makes
		inference for study-level parameters with no distributional
		assumption. Specifically, it can construct confidence intervals
		for unknown, fixed study-level parameters via confidence
		distribution. Furthermore, it can perform  estimation via
		asymptotic confidence distribution whether tie or near tie
		condition exist or not. The plot.gmeta() function to visualize
		individual and combined CDs through extended forest plots is
		also available. Compared to version 2.2-6, version 2.3-0
		contains a new function np.gmeta().
