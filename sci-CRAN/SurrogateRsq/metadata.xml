		Goodness-of-Fit Analysis for Categorical Data using the Surrogate
		R-Squared // To assess and compare the models' goodness of fit,
		R-squared is one of the most popular measures. For categorical
		data analysis, however, no universally adopted R-squared
		measure can resemble the ordinary least square (OLS) R-squared
		for linear models with continuous data. This package implement
		the surrogate R-squared measure for categorical data analysis,
		which is proposed in the study of Dungang Liu, Xiaorui Zhu,
		Brandon Greenwell, and Zewei Lin (2022) doi:10.1111/bmsp.12289.
		It can generate a point or interval measure of the surrogate
		R-squared. It can also provide a ranking measure of the
		percentage contribution of each variable to the overall
		surrogate R-squared. This ranking assessment allows one to
		check the importance of each variable in terms of their
		explained variance. This package can be jointly used with other
		existing R packages for variable selection and model
		diagnostics in the model-building process.
