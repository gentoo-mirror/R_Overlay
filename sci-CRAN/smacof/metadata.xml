		Multidimensional Scaling // Implements the following approaches
		for multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on stress minimization
		using majorization (smacof): ratio/interval/ordinal/spline MDS
		on symmetric dissimilarity matrices, MDS with external
		constraints on the configuration, individual differences
		scaling (idioscal, indscal), MDS with spherical restrictions,
		and ratio/interval/ordinal/spline unfolding (circular
		restrictions, row-conditional). Various tools and extensions
		like jackknife MDS, bootstrap MDS, permutation tests, MDS
		biplots, gravity models, inverse MDS, unidimensional scaling,
		drift vectors (asymmetric MDS), classical scaling, and
		Procrustes are implemented as well.
