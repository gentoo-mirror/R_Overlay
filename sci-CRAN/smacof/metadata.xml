		Multidimensional Scaling // Provides the following approaches for
		multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on stress minimization
		using majorization (smacof): basic MDS on symmetric
		dissimilarity matrices, MDS with external constraints on the
		configuration, individual differences scaling (idioscal,
		indscal, and friends), MDS with spherical restrictions, and
		unfolding. The MDS type can be ratio, interval, ordinal, and
		monotone splines. Various tools and extensions like jackknife
		MDS, bootstrap MDS, permutation tests, MDS biplots, gravity
		models, inverse MDS, unidimensional scaling, drift vectors
		(asymmetric MDS), classical scaling, and Procrustes are
		implemented as well.
