		Package Directives and Collaboration Networks in CRAN // Core
		visualizations and summaries for the CRAN package database. The
		package provides comprehensive methods for cleaning up and
		organizing the information in the CRAN package database, for
		building package directives networks (depends, imports,
		suggests, enhances, linking to) and collaboration networks,
		producing package dependence trees, and for computing useful
		summaries and producing interactive visualizations from the
		resulting networks and summaries. The resulting networks can be
		coerced to 'igraph' https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph
		objects for further analyses and modelling.
