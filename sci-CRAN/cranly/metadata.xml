		Package Directives and Collaboration Networks in CRAN // Provides
		core visualisations and summaries for the CRAN package
		database. The package provides comprehensive methods for
		cleaning up and organising the information in the CRAN package
		database, for building package directives networks (depends,
		imports, suggests, enhances, linking to) and collaboration
		networks, producing package dependence trees, and for computing
		useful summaries and producing interactive visualisations from
		the resulting networks. The package also provides functions to
		coerce the networks to 'igraph'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph objects for further
		analyses and modelling.
