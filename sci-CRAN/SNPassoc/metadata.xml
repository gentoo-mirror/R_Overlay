		SNPs-based Whole Genome Association Studies // This package
		carries out most common analysis when performing whole genome
		association studies. These analyses include descriptive
		statistics and exploratory analysis of missing values,
		calculation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, analysis of
		association based on generalized linear models (either for
		quantitative or binary traits), and analysis of multiple SNPs
		(haplotype and epistasis analysis). Permutation test and
		related tests (sum statistic and truncated product) are also
		implemented. Max-statistic and genetic risk-allele score exact
		distributions are also possible to be estimated.
