		SNPs-Based Whole Genome Association Studies // Functions to
		perform most of the common analysis in genome association
		studies are implemented. These analyses include descriptive
		statistics and exploratory analysis of missing values,
		calculation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, analysis of
		association based on generalized linear models (either for
		quantitative or binary traits), and analysis of multiple SNPs
		(haplotype and epistasis analysis). Permutation test and
		related tests (sum statistic and truncated product) are also
		implemented. Max-statistic and genetic risk-allele score exact
		distributions are also possible to be estimated. The methods
		are described in Gonzalez JR et al. (2007) doi:
		10.1093/bioinformatics/btm025.
