		Robust Linear Mixed Effects Models // Implements the Robust
		Scoring Equations estimator to fit linear mixed effects models
		robustly. Robustness is achieved by modification of the scoring
		equations combined with the Design Adaptive Scale approach.
		Includes some references to the archived packages
		'robustvarComp' and 'heavy'. Both packages are only needed to
		reproduce a simulation study and are not required for the
		running of the regular package functions. You can install both
		packages by downloading the latest version from the CRAN
		archive.
