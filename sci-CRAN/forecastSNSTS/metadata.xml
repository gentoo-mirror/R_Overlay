		Forecasting for Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series //
		Methods to compute linear h-step ahead prediction coefficients
		based on localised and iterated Yule-Walker estimates and
		empirical mean squared and absolute prediction errors for the
		resulting predictors. Also, functions to compute
		autocovariances for AR(p) processes, to simulate tvARMA(p,q)
		time series, and to verify an assumption from Kley et al.
