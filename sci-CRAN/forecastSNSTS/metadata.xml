		Forecasting for Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series //
		Methods to compute linear h-step ahead prediction coefficients
		based on localised and iterated Yule-Walker estimates and
		empirical mean squared prediction errors for the resulting
		predictors. Also, functions to compute autocovariances for
		AR(p) processes, to simulate tvARMA(p,q) time series, and to
		verify an assumption from Kley et al. (2017), Preprint
		arXiv:1611.04460 http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04460.
