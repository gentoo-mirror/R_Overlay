		Non-Local Alternative Priors in Psychology // Conducts Bayesian
		Hypothesis tests of a point null hypothesis against a two-sided
		alternative using Non-local Alternative Prior (NAP) for one-
		and two-sample z- and t-tests (Pramanik and Johnson, 2022).
		Under the alternative, the NAP is assumed on the standardized
		effects size in one-sample tests and on their differences in
		two-sample tests. The package considers two types of NAP
		densities: (1) the normal moment prior, and (2) the composite
		alternative. In fixed design tests, the functions calculate the
		Bayes factors and the expected weight of evidence for varied
		effect size and sample size. The package also provides a
		sequential testing framework using the Sequential Bayes Factor
		(SBF) design. The functions calculate the operating
		characteristics (OC) and the average sample number (ASN), and
		also conducts sequential tests for a sequentially observed
		data.
