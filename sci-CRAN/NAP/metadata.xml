		Non-Local Alternative Priors in Psychology // Conducts Bayesian
		Hypothesis tests of a point null hypothesis against a two-sided
		alternative using Non-local Alternative Prior (NAP) for one-
		and two-sample z- and t-tests (Johnson, V. and Rossell, R.
		(2010) doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00730.x). Under the
		alternative, the NAP is assumed on the standardized effects
		size in one-sample tests and on their differences in two-sample
		tests. The package considers two types of NAP densities: (1)
		the normal moment prior, and (2) the composite alternative. In
		fixed design tests, the functions calculate the Bayes factors
		and the expected weight of evidence for varied effect size and
		sample size. The package also provides a sequential testing
		framework using the Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design. The
		functions calculate the operating characteristics (OC) and the
		average sample number (ASN), and also conducts sequential tests
		for a sequentially observed data.
