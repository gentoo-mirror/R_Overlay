		Calculating Proportionality Between Vectors of Compositional Data
		// The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often
		begins with correlation-based analyses. However, this approach
		lacks statistical validity when applied to relative data. This
		includes, for example, biological count data generated by high-
		throughput RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation
		(ChIP), ChIP-sequencing, Methyl-Capture sequencing, and other
		techniques. This package implements two metrics, phi [Lovell et
		al (2015) DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075] and rho [Erb and
		Notredame (2016) DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8], to provide a
		valid alternatives to correlation for relative data. Unlike
		correlation, these metrics give the same result for both
		relative and absolute data. Pairs that are strongly
		proportional in relative space are also strongly correlated in
		absolute space. Proportionality avoids the pitfall of spurious
		correlation.
