		Calculating Proportionality Between Vectors of Compositional Data
		// The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often
		begins with correlation-based analyses. However, correlation
		lacks validity when applied to relative data, including count
		data generated by next-generation sequencing. This package
		implements several metrics for proportionality, including phi
		[Lovell et al (2015) DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075] and rho
		[Erb and Notredame (2016) DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8]. This
		package also implements several metrics for differential
		proportionality. Unlike correlation, these measures give the
		same result for both relative and absolute data.
