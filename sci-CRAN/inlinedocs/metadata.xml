		Convert Inline Comments to Documentation // Generates Rd files
		from R source code with comments. The main features of the
		default syntax are that (1) docs are defined in comments near
		the relevant code, (2) function argument names are not repeated
		in comments, and (3) examples are defined in R code, not
		comments. It is also easy to define a new syntax.
