		Accelerated Failure Time Model with Generalized Estimating
		Equations // A collection of methods for both the rank-based
		estimates and least square estimates to the Accelerated Failure
		Time (AFT) model. For rank-based estimation, it provides
		approaches that include the computationally efficient Gehan's
		weight and the general's weight such as the logrank weight.
		Details of the rank-based estimation can be found in Chiou et
		al. (2014) doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9388-2 and Chiou et al.
		(2015) doi:10.1002/sim.6415. For the least-square estimation,
		the estimating equation is solved with Generalized Estimating
		Equations (GEE). Moreover, in multivariate cases, the
		dependence working correlation structure can be specified in
		GEE's setting. Details on the least-squares estimation can be
		found in Chiou et al. (2014) doi:10.1007/s10985-014-9292-x.
