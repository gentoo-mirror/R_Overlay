		Copula Graphical Models for Heterogeneous Mixed Data // A multi-
		core R package that allows for the statistical modeling of
		multi-group multivariate mixed data using Gaussian graphical
		models. Combining the Gaussian copula framework with the fused
		graphical lasso penalty, the 'heteromixgm' package can handle a
		wide variety of datasets found in various sciences. The package
		also includes an option to perform model selection using the
		AIC, BIC and EBIC information criteria, a function that plots
		partial correlation graphs based on the selected precision
		matrices, as well as simulate mixed heterogeneous data for
		exploratory or simulation purposes and one multi-group
		multivariate mixed agricultural dataset pertaining to maize
		yields. The package implements the methodological developments
		found in Hermes et al. (2024)
