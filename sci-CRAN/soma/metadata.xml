		General-Purpose Optimisation With the Self-Organising Migrating
		Algorithm // This package provides an R implementation of the
		Self-Organising Migrating Algorithm, a general-purpose,
		stochastic optimisation algorithm. The approach is similar to
		that of genetic algorithms, although it is based on the idea of
		a series of ``migrations'' by a fixed set of individuals,
		rather than the development of successive generations. It can
		be applied to any cost-minimisation problem with a bounded
		parameter space, and is robust to local minima.
