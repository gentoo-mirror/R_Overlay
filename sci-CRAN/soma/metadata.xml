		General-Purpose Optimisation with the Self-Organising Migrating
		Algorithm // An R implementation of the Self-Organising
		Migrating Algorithm, a general-purpose, stochastic optimisation
		algorithm. The approach is similar to that of genetic
		algorithms, although it is based on the idea of a series of
		``migrations'' by a fixed set of individuals, rather than the
		development of successive generations. It can be applied to any
		cost-minimisation problem with a bounded parameter space, and
		is robust to local minima.
