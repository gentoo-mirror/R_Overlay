		Polycross Designs ("PolycrossDesigns") // A polycross is the
		pollination by natural hybridization of a group of genotypes,
		generally selected, grown in isolation from other compatible
		genotypes in such a way to promote random open pollination. A
		particular practical application of the polycross method occurs
		in the production of a synthetic variety resulting from cross-
		pollinated plants. Laying out these experiments in appropriate
		designs, known as polycross designs, would not only save
		experimental resources but also gather more information from
		the experiment. Different experimental situations may arise in
		polycross nurseries which may be requiring different polycross
		designs (Varghese et. al. (2015)
		doi:10.1080/02664763.2015.1043860. " Experimental designs for
		open pollination in polycross trials"). This package contains a
		function named PD() which generates nine types of polycross
		designs suitable for various experimental situations.
