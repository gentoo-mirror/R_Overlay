		Enables Blind Review of Database // Randomly reassigns the group
		identifications to one of the variables of the database, say
		Treatment, and randomly reassigns the observation numbers of
		the dataset. Reorders the observations according to these new
		numbers. Centers each group of Treatment at the grand mean in
		order to further mask the treatment. An unmasking function is
		provided so that the user can identify the potential outliers
		in terms of their original values when blinding is no longer
		needed. It is suggested that a forward search procedure be
		performed on the masked data. Details of some forward search
		functions may be found in
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forsearch.
