		Blind Review Using Forward Search Procedures // Randomly assigns
		identification to one of the variables of the dataset, say
		Treatment, and assigns random numbers to all the observations
		of the dataset. Reorders the observations according to the
		random numbers, and then runs the appropriate forward search
		function on the blinded dataset. A file is created from which
		the user can identify any outliers using the graphics function
		in this package. Centers each fixed coefficient at the grand
		mean prior to graphing in order to further mask the treatment.
		An unmasking function is provided so that the user can identify
		the potential outliers in terms of their original values when
		blinding is no longer needed. Details of the forward search
		functions may be found in
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forsearch.
