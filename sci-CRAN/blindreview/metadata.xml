		Blind Review Using Forward Search Procedures // Randomly assigns
		identification to one of the variables of the dataset, say
		Treatment, and assigns random numbers to all the observations
		of the dataset. Reorders the database according to the random
		numbers, and then runs the appropriate forward search function
		on the blinded dataset. A file is created from which the user
		can identify any outliers using the graphics function in this
		package. An unmasking function is provided so that the user can
		identify the potential outliers in terms of their original
		values when blinding is no longer needed. Details of the
		forward search functions may be found in
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forsearch.
