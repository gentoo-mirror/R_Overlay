		Trajectory Miner: a Sequence Analysis Toolkit // Set of sequence
		analysis tools for manipulating, describing and rendering
		categorical sequences, and more generally mining sequence data
		in the field of social sciences. Although this sequence
		analysis package is primarily intended for state or event
		sequences that describe time use or life courses such as family
		formation histories or professional careers, its features also
		apply to many other kinds of categorical sequence data. It
		accepts many different sequence representations as input and
		provides tools for converting sequences from one format to
		another. It offers several functions for describing and
		rendering sequences, for computing distances between sequences
		with different metrics (among which optimal matching), original
		dissimilarity-based analysis tools, and functions for
		extracting the most frequent event subsequences and identifying
		the most discriminating ones among them. A user's guide can be
		found on the TraMineR web page.
