		Trajectory Miner: a Toolbox for Exploring and Rendering Sequences
		// Toolbox for the manipulation, description and rendering of
		categorical sequences, and more generally the mining of
		sequence data in the field of social sciences. Although this
		sequence analysis toolbox is primarily intended for analyzing
		state or event sequences that describe life courses such as
		family formation histories or professional careers, its
		features also apply to many other kinds of categorical sequence
		data. It accepts many different sequence representations as
		input and provides tools for converting sequences from one
		format to another. It offers several functions for describing
		and rendering sequences, for computing distances between
		sequences with different metrics (among which optimal
		matching), original dissimilarity-based analysis tools, and
		functions for extracting the most frequent subsequences and
		identifying the most discriminating ones among them. A user's
		guide can be found on the TraMineR web page.
