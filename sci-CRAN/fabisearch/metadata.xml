		Change Point Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series Networks
		// Implementation of the Factorized Binary Search (FaBiSearch)
		methodology for the estimation of the number and location of
		multiple change points in the network (or clustering) structure
		of multivariate high-dimensional time series. The method is
		motivated by the detection of change points in functional
		connectivity networks for functional magnetic resonance imaging
		(fMRI) data. FaBiSearch uses non-negative matrix factorization
		(NMF), an unsupervised dimension reduction technique, and a new
		binary search algorithm to identify multiple change points.  It
		also requires minimal assumptions. The  main routines of the
		package are detect.cps(), for multiple change point detection,
		est.net(), for estimating a network between stationary
		multivariate time series, net.3dplot(), for plotting the
		estimated functional connectivity networks, and opt.rank(), for
		finding the optimal rank in NMF for a given data set. The
		functions have been extensively tested on simulated
		multivariate high-dimensional time series data and fMRI data.
		For details on the FaBiSearch methodology, please see Ondrus et
		al. (2021).
