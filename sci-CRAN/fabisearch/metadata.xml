		Change Point Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series Networks
		// Implementation of the Factorized Binary Search (FaBiSearch)
		methodology for the estimation of the number and the location
		of multiple change points in the network (or clustering)
		structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series. The
		method is motivated by the detection of change points in
		functional connectivity networks for functional magnetic
		resonance imaging (fMRI) data. FaBiSearch uses non-negative
		matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimension reduction
		technique, and a new binary search algorithm to identify
		multiple change points.  It requires minimal assumptions.
		Lastly, we provide interactive, 3-dimensional, brain-specific
		network visualization capability in a flexible, stand-alone
		function. This function can be conveniently used with any node
		coordinate atlas, and nodes can be color coded according to
		community membership, if applicable. The output is an elegantly
		displayed network laid over a cortical surface, which can
		berotated in the 3-dimensional space. The main routines of the
		package are detect.cps(), for multiple change point detection,
		est.net(), for estimating a network between stationary
		multivariate time series, net.3dplot(), for plotting the
		estimated functional connectivity networks, and opt.rank(), for
		finding the optimal rank in NMF for a given data set. The
		functions have been extensively tested on simulated
		multivariate high-dimensional time series data and fMRI data.
		For details on the FaBiSearch methodology, please see Ondrus et
		al. (2021) arXiv:2103.06347. For a more detailed explanation
		and applied examples of the fabisearch package, please see
		Ondrus and Cribben (2021), preprint.
