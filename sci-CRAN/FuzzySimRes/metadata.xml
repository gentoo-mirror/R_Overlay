		Simulation and Resampling Methods for Epistemic Fuzzy Data //
		Random simulations of fuzzy numbers are still a challenging
		problem. The aim of this package is to provide the respective
		procedures to simulate fuzzy random variables, especially in
		the case of the piecewise linear fuzzy numbers (PLFNs, see
		Coroianua et al. (2013) doi:10.1016/j.fss.2013.02.005 for the
		further details). Additionally, the special resampling
		algorithms known as the epistemic bootstrap are provided (see
		Grzegorzewski and Romaniuk (2022) doi:10.34768/amcs-2022-0021,
		Grzegorzewski and Romaniuk (2022)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39, Romaniuk et al. (2024)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2024-016) together with the functions to apply
		statistical tests and estimate various characteristics based on
		the epistemic bootstrap. The package also includes real-life
		datasets of epistemic fuzzy triangular and trapezoidal numbers.
		The fuzzy numbers used in this package are consistent with the
		'FuzzyNumbers' package.
