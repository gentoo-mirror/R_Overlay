		Rectangle Packing // Rectangle packing is a packing problem where
		rectangles are placed into a larger rectangular region (without
		overlapping) in order to maximise the use space.  Rectangles
		are packed using the skyline heuristic as discussed in Lijun et
		al (2011) 'A Skyline-Based Heuristic for the 2D Rectangular
		Strip Packing Problem' doi:10.1007/978-3-642-21827-9_29.  A
		function is also included for determining a good small-sized
		box for containing a given set of rectangles.
