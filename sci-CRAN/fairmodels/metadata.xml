		Flexible Tool for Bias Detection, Visualization, and Mitigation
		// Measure fairness metrics in one place for many models. Check
		how big is model's bias towards different races, sex,
		nationalities etc. Use measures such as Statistical Parity,
		Equal odds to detect the discrimination against unprivileged
		groups. Visualize the bias using heatmap, radar plot, biplot,
		bar chart (and more!). There are various pre-processing and
		post-processing bias mitigation algorithms implemented. Find
		more details in (Winiewski, Biecek (2021)) arXiv:2104.00507.
