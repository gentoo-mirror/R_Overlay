		Methods and Measures for Brain, Cognitive, and Psychometric
		Network Analysis // Implements network analysis and graph
		theory measures used in neuroscience, cognitive science, and
		psychology. Methods include various filtering methods and
		approaches such as threshold, dependency (Kenett, Tumminello,
		Madi, Gur-Gershgoren, Mantegna,  Ben-Jacob, 2010
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015032), Information Filtering
		Networks (Barfuss, Massara, Di Matteo,  Aste, 2016
		doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.94.062306), and Efficiency-Cost
		Optimization (Fallani, Latora,  Chavez, 2017
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005305). Brain methods include the
		recently developed Connectome Predictive Modeling (see
		references in package). Also implements several network
		measures including local network characteristics (e.g.,
		centrality), community-level network characteristics (e.g.,
		community centrality), global network characteristics (e.g.,
		clustering coefficient), and various other measures associated
		with the reliability and reproducibility of network analysis.
