		Reproducible Data Science Environments with 'Nix' // Simplifies
		the creation of reproducible data science environments using
		the 'Nix' package manager, as described in Dolstra (2006) ISBN
		90-393-4130-3. The included `rix()` function generates a
		complete description of the environment as a `default.nix`
		file, which can then be built using 'Nix'. This results in
		project specific software environments with pinned versions of
		R, packages, linked system dependencies, and other tools.
		Additional helpers make it easy to run R code in 'Nix' software
		environments for testing and production.
