		Reproducible Data Science Environments with 'Nix' // Simplifies
		the creation of reproducible development environments using the
		'Nix' package manager. The included `rix()` function generates
		a complete description of the development environment as a
		`default.nix` file, which can then be built using 'Nix'. This
		results in project specific software environments with pinned
		versions of R, packages, linked system dependencies, and other
		tools. Additional helpers make it easy to run R code in 'Nix'
		software environments for testing and production.
