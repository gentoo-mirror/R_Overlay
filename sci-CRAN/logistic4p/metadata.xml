		Logistic Regression with Misclassification in Dependent Variables
		// Error in a binary dependent variable, also known as
		misclassification, has not drawn much attention in psychology.
		Ignoring misclassification in logistic regression can result in
		misleading parameter estimates and statistical inference. This
		package conducts logistic regression analysis with
		misspecification in outcome variables.
