		Non-Ordered Vectors // Functionality for manipulating values of
		associative maps.  Ordinary R vectors are unsuitable for
		working with values of associative maps because elements of an
		R vector may be accessed by reference to their location in the
		vector, but associative maps are stored in arbitrary order.
		However, when associating keys with values one needs both parts
		to be in 1-1 correspondence, so one cannot dispense with the
		order entirely.  The 'disordR' package includes a single S4
		class, disord.  This class allows one to perform only those
		operations appropriate for manipulating values of associative
		maps and prevents any other operation (such as accessing an
		element at a particular location).  A useful heuristic is that
		one is only allowed to access or modify a disord object using a
		python list comprehension.  The idea is to prevent ill-defined
		operations on values (or keys) of associative maps, whose order
		is undefined or at best implementation-specific, while allowing
		and facilitating sensible operations.  To cite the package in
		publications please use Hankin (2022)
