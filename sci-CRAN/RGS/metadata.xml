		Recursive Gradient Scanning Algorithm // Provides a recursive
		gradient scanning algorithm for discretizing continuous
		variables in Logistic and Cox regression models. This algorithm
		is especially effective in identifying optimal cut-points for
		variables with U-shaped relationships to 'lnOR' (the natural
		logarithm of the odds ratio) or 'lnHR' (the natural logarithm
		of the hazard ratio), thereby enhancing model fit,
		interpretability, and predictive power. By iteratively scanning
		and calculating gradient changes, the method accurately
		pinpoints critical cut-points within nonlinear relationships,
		transforming continuous variables into categorical ones. This
		approach improves risk classification and regression analysis
		performance, increasing interpretability and practical
		relevance in clinical and risk management settings.
