		A Rules Engine Based on 'Drools' // An interface for using the
		popular Java based Drools, which is a Business Rule Management
		System (See https://www.drools.org for more information). This
		package provides data scientists an intuitive interface to
		execute business rules on datasets for the purpose of analysis
		or designing intelligent systems, while leveraging the Drools
		rule engine. Rules written in DRL format accepted natively by
		Drools can also be executed through an R interface. Credits to
		Mu Sigma for their continued support throughout the development
		of the package.
