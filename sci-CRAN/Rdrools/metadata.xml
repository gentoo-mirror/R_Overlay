		A Rules Engine Based on 'Drools' // An interface for using the
		popular Java based Drools, which is a Business Rule Management
		System (See https://www.drools.org for more information). This
		package provides data scientists an intuitive interface to
		execute business rules on datasets for the purpose of analysis
		or designing intelligent systems, while leveraging the Drools
		rule engine. Rules can be defined in a simple format in a CSV,
		imported into the R Session as a data frame, and passed
		directly to the rule-checking functions. Rules written in DRL
		format, accepted natively by Drools, can also be executed
		through an R interface. Credits to Mu Sigma for their continued
		support throughout the development of the package.
