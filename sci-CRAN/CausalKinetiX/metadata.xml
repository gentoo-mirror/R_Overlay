		Learning Stable Structures in Kinetic Systems // Implementation
		of 'CausalKinetiX', a framework for learning stable structures
		in kinetic systems. Apart from the main functions
		CausalKinetiX() and CausalKinetiX.modelranking() it includes
		functions to generate data from three simulations models, which
		can be used to benchmark structure learning methods for linear
		ordinary differential equation models. A detailed description
		of the underlying methods as well as details on the examples
		are given in Pfister, Bauer and Peters (2018) arXiv:1810.11776.
