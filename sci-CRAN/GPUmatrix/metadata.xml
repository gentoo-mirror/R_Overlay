		Basic Linear Algebra with GPU // GPUs are great resources for
		data analysis, especially in statistics and linear algebra.
		Unfortunately, very few packages connect R to the GPU, and none
		of them are transparent enough to run the computations on the
		GPU without substantial changes to the code. The maintenance of
		these packages is cumbersome: several of the earlier attempts
		have been removed from their respective repositories. It would
		be desirable to have a properly maintained R package that takes
		advantage of the GPU with minimal changes to the existing code.
		We have developed the GPUmatrix package (available on CRAN).
		GPUmatrix mimics the behavior of the Matrix package and extends
		R to use the GPU for computations. It includes single(FP32) and
		double(FP64) precision data types, and provides support for
		sparse matrices. It is easy to learn, and requires very few
		code changes to perform the operations on the GPU. GPUmatrix
		relies on either the Torch or Tensorflow R packages to perform
		the GPU operations. We have demonstrated its usefulness for
		several statistical applications and machine learning
		applications: non-negative matrix factorization, logistic
		regression and general linear models. We have also included a
		comparison of GPU and CPU performance on different matrix
		operations.
