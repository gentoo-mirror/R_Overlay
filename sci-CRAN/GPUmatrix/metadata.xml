		Basic Linear Algebra with GPU // Motivation: GPU power is a great
		resource for computational biology specifically in statistics
		and linear algebra. Unfortunately, very few packages connect R
		with the GPU and none of them are transparent enough to perform
		the computations on the GPU without substantial changes to the
		code. Most of them lack proper maintenance: several of the
		previous attempts were removed from the corresponding
		repositories. It would be desirable to have an R package,
		properly maintained, that exploits the use of the GPU with
		minimal changes in the existing code. Results: We have
		developed the 'GPUMatrix' package. 'GPUMatrix' mimics the
		behavior of the Matrix package and extends R to use the GPU for
		computations. It is easy to learn and very few changes in the
		code are required to work on the GPU. 'GPUMatrix' relies on
		either 'Tensorflow' or 'Torch' R packages to perform the GPU
		operations. Its vignette shows some toy examples on non-
		negative factorization and other factorization used in
		'bioinformatics'.
