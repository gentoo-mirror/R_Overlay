		Estimating Finite State Machine Models from Data // Our method
		automatically generates models of dynamic decision- making that
		both have strong predictive power and are interpretable in
		human terms. We use an efficient model representation and a
		genetic algorithm-based estimation process to generate simple
		deterministic approximations that explain most of the structure
		of complex stochastic processes. We have applied the software
		to empirical data, and demonstrated it's ability to recover
		known data- generating processes by simulating data with agent-
		based models and correctly deriving the underlying decision
		models for multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity.
