		Pathway Enrichment Analysis Based on Bayesian Network // Maleknia
		et al. (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.01.13.905448. A novel pathway
		enrichment analysis package based on Bayesian network to
		investigate the topology features of the pathways. firstly, 187
		kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) human non-
		metabolic pathways which their cycles were eliminated by
		biological approach, enter in analysis as Bayesian network
		structures. The constructed Bayesian network were optimized by
		the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (lasso) and the
		parameters were learned based on gene expression data. Finally,
		the impacted pathways were enriched by Fishers Exact Test on
		significant parameters.
