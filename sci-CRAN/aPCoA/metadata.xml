		Covariate Adjusted PCoA Plot // In fields such as ecology,
		microbiology, and genomics, non-Euclidean distances are widely
		applied to describe pairwise dissimilarity between samples.
		Given these pairwise distances, principal coordinates analysis
		(PCoA) is commonly used to construct a visualization of the
		data. However, confounding covariates can make patterns related
		to the scientific question of interest difficult to observe. We
		provide 'aPCoA' as an easy-to-use tool to improve data
		visualization in this context, enabling enhanced presentation
		of the effects of interest. Details are described in Yushu Shi,
		Liangliang Zhang, Kim-Anh Do, Christine Peterson and Robert
		Jenq (2020) arXiv:2003.09544.
