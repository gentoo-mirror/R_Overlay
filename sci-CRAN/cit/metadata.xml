		Causal Inference Test // A likelihood-based hypothesis testing
		approach is implemented for assessing causal mediation.
		Described in Millstein, Chen, and Breton (2016),
		DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw135, it could be used to test for
		mediation of a known causal association between a DNA variant,
		the 'instrumental variable', and a clinical outcome or
		phenotype by gene expression or DNA methylation, the potential
		mediator. Another example would be testing mediation of the
		effect of a drug on a clinical outcome by the molecular target.
		The hypothesis test generates a p-value or permutation-based
		FDR value with confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty in
		the causal inference. The outcome can be represented by either
		a continuous or binary variable, the potential mediator is
		continuous, and the instrumental variable can be continuous or
		binary and is not limited to a single variable but may be a
		design matrix representing multiple variables.
