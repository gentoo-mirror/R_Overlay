		Construct Polygons Summarising the Location and Variability of
		Point Sets // Various applications in invasive species biology,
		conservation biology, epidemiology and elsewhere involve
		sampling of sets of 2D points from a posterior distribution.
		The number of such point sets may be large, say 1000 or 10000.
		This package facilitates visualisation of such output by
		constructing seven nested polygons representing the location
		and variability of the point sets. This can be used, for
		example, to visualise the range boundary of a species, and
		uncertainty in the location of that boundary.
