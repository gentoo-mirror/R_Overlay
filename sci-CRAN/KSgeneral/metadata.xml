		Computing P-Values of the One-Sample K-S Test and the Two-Sample
		K-S and Kuiper Tests for (Dis)Continuous Null Distribution //
		Contains functions to compute p-values for the one-sample and
		two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests and the two-sample
		Kuiper test for any fixed critical level and arbitrary
		(possibly very large) sample sizes. For the one-sample KS test,
		this package implements a novel, accurate and efficient method
		named Exact-KS-FFT, which allows the pre-specified cumulative
		distribution function under the null hypothesis to be
		continuous, purely discrete or mixed. In the two-sample case,
		it is assumed that both samples come from an unspecified
		(unknown) continuous, purely discrete or mixed distribution,
		i.e. ties (repeated observations) are allowed, and exact
		p-values of the KS and the Kuiper tests are computed. Note, the
		two-sample Kuiper test is often used when data samples are on
		the line or on the circle (circular data). To cite this package
		in publication: (for the use of the one-sample KS test)
