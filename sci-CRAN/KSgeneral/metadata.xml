		Computing P-Values of the K-S Test for (Dis)Continuous Null
		Distribution // Computes a p-value of the one-sample two-sided
		(or one-sided, as a special case) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
		statistic, for any fixed critical level, and an arbitrary,
		possibly large sample size for a pre-specified purely discrete,
		mixed or continuous cumulative distribution function (cdf)
		under the null hypothesis. If a data sample is supplied,
		'KSgeneral' computes the p-value corresponding to the value of
		the KS test statistic computed based on the user provided data
		sample. The package 'KSgeneral' implements a novel, accurate
		and efficient method named Exact-KS-FFT, expressing the p-value
		as a double-boundary non-crossing probability for a homogeneous
		Poisson process, which is then efficiently computed using Fast
		Fourier Transform (FFT). The package can also be used to
		compute and plot the complementary cdf of the KS statistic
		which is known to depend on the hypothesized distribution when
		the latter is discontinuous (i.e. purely discrete or mixed).
