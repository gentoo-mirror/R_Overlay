		Analyzing Students' Performance Dataset in Physics Education
		Research (SPHERE) using Machine Learning (ML) // A simple
		package facilitating ML based analysis for physics education
		research (PER) purposes. The implemented machine learning
		technique is random forest optimized by item response theory
		(IRT) for feature selection and genetic algorithm (GA) for
		hyperparameter tuning. The data analyzed here has been made
		available in the CRAN repository through the 'spheredata'
		package. The SPHERE stands for Students' Performance in Physics
		Education Research (PER). The students are the eleventh graders
		learning physics at the high school curriculum. We follow the
		stream of multidimensional students' assessment as probed by
		some research based assessments in PER. The goal is to predict
		the students' performance at the end of the learning process.
		Three learning domains are measured including conceptual
		understanding, scientific ability, and scientific attitude.
		Furthermore, demographic backgrounds and potential variables
		predicting students' performance on physics are also
		demonstrated.
