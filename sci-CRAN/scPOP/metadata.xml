		Metrics for Benchmarking scRNA-Seq Batch Correction // Evaluate
		batch effect correction algorithms for scRNA-seq using multiple
		established methods, including the Adjusted Rand Index,
		Normalized Mutual Information, Local Inverse Simpson Index, and
		Silhouette Width. Methods for aggregating and weighing multiple
		metrics together are also included. For further explanation of
		methods, see Swamy et al. (2021)doi:10.1101/2021.03.26.437190 .
