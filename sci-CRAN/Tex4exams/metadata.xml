		Generating 'Sweave' Code for 'R/exams' Questions in Mathematics
		// When using the R package  'exams'  to write mathematics
		questions in 'Sweave' files, the output of a lot of R functions
		need to be adjusted for display in mathematical formulas.
		Specifically, the functions were accumulated when writing
		questions for the  topics of the mathematics courses College
		Algebra, Precalculus, Calculus, Differential Equations,
		Introduction to Probability, and Linear Algebra.  The output of
		the developed functions can be used in 'Sweave' files.
