		High Dimensional Bayesian Survival Mediation Analysis // Perform
		mediation analysis for time to event high-dimensional data.
		Mediation Analysis proposed by Miocevic et al.(2017)
		doi:10.1080/10705511.2017.1342541 as a statistical tool in the
		Bayesian framework. Time to event data analysis methods like
		Cox proportional hazard model, accelerated failure time model
		to work with high dimensional data with Bayesian approaches are
		provided. Missing data imputation techniques tool to work with
		high dimensional data coupled for mediation analysis by
		presented by the active mediator variables.
