		Social Ranking Solutions for Power Relations on Coalitions // The
		notion of power index has been widely used in literature to
		evaluate the influence of individual players (e.g., voters,
		political parties, nations, stockholders, etc.) involved in a
		collective decision situation like an electoral system, a
		parliament, a council, a management board, etc., where players
		may form coalitions. Traditionally this ranking is determined
		through numerical evaluation. More often than not however only
		ordinal data between coalitions is known. The package
		'socialranking' offers a set of solutions to rank players based
		on a transitive ranking between coalitions, including through
		CP-Majority, ordinal Banzhaf or lexicographic excellence
		solution summarized by Tahar Allouche, Bruno Escoffier, Stefano
		Moretti and Meltem ztrk (2020, doi:10.24963/ijcai.2020/3).
