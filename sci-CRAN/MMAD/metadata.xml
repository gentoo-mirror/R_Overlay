		MM Algorithm Based on the Assembly-Decomposition Technology //
		The Minorize-Maximization(MM) algorithm based on Assembly-
		Decomposition(AD) technology can be used for model estimation
		of parametric models, semi-parametric models and non-parametric
		models. We selected parametric models including left truncated
		normal distribution, type I multivariate zero-inflated
		generalized poisson distribution and multivariate compound
		zero-inflated generalized poisson distribution; semiparametric
		models include Cox model and gamma frailty model; nonparametric
		model is estimated for type II interval-censored data. These
		general methods are proposed based on the following papers,
