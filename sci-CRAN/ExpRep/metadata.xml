		Experiment Repetitions // Allows to calculate the probabilities
		of occurrences of an event in a great number of repetitions of
		Bernoulli experiment, through the application of the local and
		the integral theorem of De Moivre Laplace, and the theorem of
		Poisson. Gives the possibility to show the results graphically
		and analytically, and to compare the results obtained by the
		application of the above  theorems with those calculated by the
		direct application of the Binomial formula. Is basically useful
		for educational purposes.
