		Synthetic Experience Tracking Insurance Claims // Creation of an
		individual claims simulator which generates various features of
		non-life insurance claims. An initial set of test parameters,
		designed to mirror the experience of an Auto Liability
		portfolio, were set up and applied by default to generate a
		realistic test data set of individual claims (see vignette).
		The simulated data set then allows practitioners to back-test
		the validity of various reserving models and to prove and/or
		disprove certain actuarial assumptions made in claims
		modelling. The distributional assumptions used to generate this
		data set can be easily modified by users to match their
		experiences. Reference: Avanzi B, Taylor G, Wang M, Wong B
