		Bi-Objective k-Nearest Neighbors Imputation for Multilevel Data
		// The bi-objective k-nearest neighbors method (biokNN) is an
		imputation method designed to estimate missing values on data
		with a multilevel structure. The original algorithm is an
		extension of the k-nearest neighbors method proposed by
		Bertsimas et al. (2017)
		(https://jmlr.org/papers/v18/17-073.html) using a bi-objective
		approach.  A brief description of the method can be found in
		Cubillos (2021)
		(https://pure.au.dk/portal/files/214627979/biokNN.pdf). The
		'biokNN' package provides an R implementation of the method for
		datasets with continuous variables (e.g. employee productivity,
		student grades) and a categorical class variable (e.g.
		department, school). Given an incomplete dataset with such
		structure, this package produces complete datasets using both
		single and multiple imputation, including visualization tools
		to better understand the pattern of the missing values.
