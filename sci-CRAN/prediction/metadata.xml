		Tidy, Type-Safe 'prediction()' Methods // A one-function package
		containing prediction(), a type-safe alternative to predict()
		that always returns a data frame. The summary() method provides
		a data frame with average predictions, possibly over
		counterfactual versions of the data ( la the margins command in
		'Stata'). Marginal effect estimation is provided by the related
		package, 'margins' https://cran.r-project.org/package=margins.
		The package currently supports common model types (e.g., lm,
		glm) from the 'stats' package, as well as numerous other model
		classes from other add-on packages. See the README file or main
		package documentation page for a complete listing.
