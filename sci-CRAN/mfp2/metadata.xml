		Multivariable Fractional Polynomial Models with Extensions //
		Multivariable fractional polynomial algorithm simultaneously
		selects variables and functional forms in both generalized
		linear models and Cox proportional hazard models. Key
		references are Royston and Altman (1994) doi:10.2307/2986270
		and Royston and Sauerbrei (2008, ISBN:978-0-470-02842-1). In
		addition, it can model a sigmoid relationship between variable
		x and an outcome variable y using the approximate cumulative
		distribution transformation proposed by Royston (2014)
		doi:10.1177/1536867X1401400206. This feature distinguishes it
		from a standard fractional polynomial function, which lacks the
		ability to achieve such modeling.
