		Bayes Factor Functions // Bayes factors represent the ratio of
		probabilities assigned to data by competing scientific
		hypotheses. However, one drawback of Bayes factors is their
		dependence on prior specifications that define null and
		alternative hypotheses. Additionally, there are challenges in
		their computation. To address these issues, we define Bayes
		factor functions (BFFs) directly from common test statistics.
		BFFs express Bayes factors as a function of the prior densities
		used to define the alternative hypotheses. These prior
		densities are centered on standardized effects, which serve as
		indices for the BFF. Therefore, BFFs offer a summary of
		evidence in favor of alternative hypotheses that correspond to
		a range of scientifically interesting effect sizes. Such
		summaries remove the need for arbitrary thresholds to determine
		"statistical significance." BFFs are available in closed form
		and can be easily computed from z, t, chi-squared, and F
		statistics. They depend on hyperparameters "r" and "tau^2",
		which determine the shape and scale of the prior distributions
		defining the alternative hypotheses. For replicated designs,
		the "r" parameter in each function can be adjusted to be
		greater than 1. Plots of BFFs versus effect size provide
		informative summaries of hypothesis tests that can be easily
		aggregated across studies.
