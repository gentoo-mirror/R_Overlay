		Bayes Factor Functions // Bayes factors represent the ratio of
		probabilities assigned to data by competing scientific
		hypotheses. Drawbacks of Bayes factors are their dependence on
		prior specifications that define null and alternative
		hypotheses and difficulties encountered in their computation.
		To address these problems we define Bayes factor functions
		(BFF) directly from common test statistics. BFFs depend on a
		single non-centrality parameter that can be expressed as a
		function of standardized effect sizes, and plots of BFFs versus
		effect size provide informative summaries of hypothesis tests
		that can be easily aggregated across studies. Such summaries
		eliminate the need for arbitrary bright-line thresholds to
		determine statistical significance. BFFs are available in
		closed form and can be computed easily from z, t, chi^2, and F
		statistics.
