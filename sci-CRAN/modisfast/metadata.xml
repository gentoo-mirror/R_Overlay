		Fast and Efficient Access to MODIS Earth Observation Data //
		Programmatic interface to several NASA Earth Observation
		'OPeNDAP' servers (Open-source Project for a Network Data
		Access Protocol) (https://www.opendap.org/). Allows for easy
		downloads of MODIS subsets, as well as other Earth Observation
		datacubes, in a time-saving and efficient way : by sampling it
		at the very downloading phase (spatially, temporally and
		dimensionally).
