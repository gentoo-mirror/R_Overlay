		Optimal Distance-Based Clustering for Multidimensional Data with
		Sequential Constraint // A dynamic programming algorithm for
		optimal clustering multidimensional data with sequential
		constraint. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of
		within-cluster distances. The sequential constraint allows only
		subsequent items of the input data to form a cluster. The
		sequential constraint is typically required in clustering data
		streams or items with time stamps such as video frames, GPS
		signals of a vehicle, movement data of a person, e-pen data,
		etc. The algorithm represents an extension of Ckmeans.1d.dp to
		multiple dimensional spaces. Similarly to the one-dimensional
		case, the algorithm guarantees optimality and repeatability of
		clustering. Method clustering.sc.dp can find the optimal
		clustering if the number of clusters is known. Otherwise,
		methods findwithinss.sc.dp and backtracking.sc.dp can be used.
