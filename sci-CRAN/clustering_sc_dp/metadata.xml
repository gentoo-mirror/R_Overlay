		Optimal Distance-Based Clustering for Multidimensional Data with
		Sequential Constraint // A dynamic programming algorithm for
		optimal clustering multidimensional data with sequential
		constraint. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of
		within-cluster distances. The sequential constraint allows only
		subsequent items of the input data to form a cluster. The
		sequential constraint is typically required in clustering data
		streams or items with time stamps such as video frames, GPS
		signals of a vehicle, movement data of a person, e-pen data,
		etc. The algorithm represents an extension of 'Ckmeans.1d.dp'
		to multiple dimensional spaces. Similarly to the one-
		dimensional case, the algorithm guarantees optimality and
		repeatability of clustering. Method clustering.sc.dp() can find
		the optimal clustering if the number of clusters is known.
		Otherwise, methods findwithinss.sc.dp() and
		backtracking.sc.dp() can be used. See Szkaliczki, T. (2016)
		"clustering.sc.dp: Optimal Clustering with Sequential
		Constraint by Using Dynamic Programming" doi:
		10.32614/RJ-2016-022 for more information.
