		Sample Size Computation for Fixed N with Optimal Reward //
		Computes the optimal sample size for various 2-group designs
		(e.g., when comparing the means of two groups assuming equal
		variances, unequal variances, or comparing proportions) when
		the aim is to maximize the rewards over the full decision
		procedure of a) running a trial (with the computed sample
		size), and b) subsequently administering the winning treatment
		to the remaining N-n units in the population. Sample sizes and
		expected rewards for standard t- and z- tests are also
		provided.
