		Logistic Bayesian Lasso for Rare (or Common) Haplotype
		Association // This function takes a dataset of haplotypes and
		environmental covariates with one binary phenotype in which
		rows for individuals of uncertain phase have been augmented by
		"pseudo-individuals" who carry the possible multilocus
		genotypes consistent with the single-locus phenotypes. Bayesian
		lasso is used to find the posterior distributions of logistic
		regression coefficients, which are then used to calculate Bayes
		Factor and credible set to test for association with
		haplotypes, environmental covariates and interactions. The
		model can handle complex sampling data, in particular,
		frequency matched cases and controls with controls obtained
		using stratified sampling. This version can also be applied to
		a dataset with no environmental covariate and two correlated
		binary phenotypes.
