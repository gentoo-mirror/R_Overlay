		Tools for Interacting with 'PostgreSQL' / 'PostGIS' Databases //
		Functions to convert geometry and 'hstore' data types from
		'PostgreSQL' into standard R objects, as well as to simplify
		the import of R data frames (including spatial data frames)
		into 'PostgreSQL'. Note: This package is deprecated. For new
		projects, we recommend using the 'sf' package to interface with
		geodatabases.
