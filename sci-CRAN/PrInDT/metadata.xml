		Prediction and Interpretation in Decision Trees for
		Classification and Regression // Optimization of conditional
		inference trees from the package 'party' for classification and
		regression. For optimization, the model space is searched for
		the best tree on the full sample by means of repeated
		subsampling. Restrictions are allowed so that only trees are
		accepted which do not include pre-specified uninterpretable
		split results (cf. Weihs  Buschfeld, 2021a). The function
		PrInDT() represents the basic resampling loop for 2-class
		classification (cf. Weihs  Buschfeld, 2021a). The function
		RePrInDT() (repeated PrInDT()) allows for repeated applications
		of PrInDT() for different percentages of the observations of
		the large and the small classes (cf. Weihs  Buschfeld, 2021c).
		The function NesPrInDT() (nested PrInDT()) allows for an extra
		layer of subsampling for a specific factor variable (cf. Weihs
		Buschfeld, 2021b). The functions PrInDTMulev() and
		PrInDTMulab() deal with multilevel and multilabel
		classification. In addition to these PrInDT() variants for
		classification, the function PrInDTreg() has been developed for
		regression problems. Finally, the function PostPrInDT() allows
		for a posterior analysis of the distribution of a specified
		variable in the terminal nodes of a given tree. References are:
