		The LIC for Distributed Cosine Regression Analysis // This
		comprehensive framework for periodic time series modeling is
		designated as "CLIC" (The LIC for Distributed Cosine Regression
		Analysis) analysis. It is predicated on the assumption that the
		underlying data exhibits complex periodic structures beyond
		simple harmonic components. The philosophy of the method is
