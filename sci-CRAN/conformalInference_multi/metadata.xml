		Conformal Inference Tools for Regression with Multivariate
		Response // It computes full conformal, split conformal and
		multi-split conformal prediction regions when the response
		variable is multivariate (i.e. dimension is greater than one).
		Moreover, the package also contains plot functions to visualize
		the output of the full and split conformal functions. To
		guarantee consistency, the package structure mimics the
		univariate package 'conformalInference' by Ryan Tibshirani. See
		Lei, Gsell, Rinaldo, Tibshirani,  Wasserman (2018)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1307116 for full and split conformal
		prediction in regression, and Barber, Cands, Ramdas,
		Tibshirani (2023) doi:10.1214/23-AOS2276 for extensions beyond
		exchangeability.
