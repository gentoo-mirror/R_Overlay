		Dose Transition Pathways for Continual Reassessment Method //
		Provides the dose transition pathways (DTP) to project in
		advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for
		subsequent patients (stay, escalate, deescalate or stop early)
		using all the accumulated toxicity information; See Yap et al
		(2017) doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-0582. DTP can be used as a
		design and an operational tool and can be displayed as a table
		or flow diagram. The 'dtpcrm' package also provides the
		modified continual reassessment method (CRM) and time-to-event
		CRM (TITE-CRM) with added practical considerations to allow
		stopping early when there is sufficient evidence that the
		lowest dose is too toxic and/or there is a sufficient number of
		patients dosed at the maximum tolerated dose.
