		K-Means with Simultaneous Outlier Detection // An implementation
		of the 'k-means--' algorithm proposed by Chawla and Gionis,
		2013 in their paper, "k-means-- : A unified approach to
		clustering and outlier detection. SIAM International Conference
		on Data Mining (SDM13)", doi:10.1137/1.9781611972832.21 and
		using 'ordering' described by Howe, 2013 in the thesis,
		Clustering and anomaly detection in tropical cyclones". Useful
		for creating (potentially) tighter clusters than standard
		k-means and simultaneously finding outliers inexpensively in
		multidimensional space.
