		Overflow Data for Quantitative Peace Science Research // These
		are data and functions to support quantitative peace science
		research. The data are important state-year information on
		democracy and wealth, which require periodic updates and
		regular maintenance. The functions permit some exploratory and
		diagnostic assessment of the kinds of data in demand by the
		community, but do not impose many dependencies on the user.
