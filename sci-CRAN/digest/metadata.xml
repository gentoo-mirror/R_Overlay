		Create Compact Hash Digests of R Objects // Implementation of a
		function 'digest()' for the creation of hash digests of
		arbitrary R objects (using the 'md5', 'sha-1', 'sha-256',
		'crc32', 'xxhash', 'murmurhash', 'spookyhash', 'blake3' and
		'crc32c' algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language
		objects, as well as functions such as'hmac()' to create hash-
		based message authentication code. Please note that this
		package is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic purposes
		for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such
		as 'OpenSSL' should be used.
