		Weighted k-Means Clustering // Entropy weighted k-means (ewkm) by
		Liping Jing, Michael K. Ng and Joshua Zhexue Huang (2007)
		doi:10.1109/TKDE.2007.1048 is a weighted subspace clustering
		algorithm that is well suited to very high dimensional data.
		Weights are calculated as the importance of a variable with
		regard to cluster membership.  The two-level variable weighting
		clustering algorithm tw-k-means (twkm) by Xiaojun Chen, Xiaofei
		Xu, Joshua Zhexue Huang and Yunming Ye (2013)
		doi:10.1109/TKDE.2011.262 introduces two types of weights, the
		weights on individual variables and the weights on variable
		groups, and they are calculated during the clustering process.
		The feature group weighted k-means (fgkm) by Xiaojun Chen,
		Yunminng Ye, Xiaofei Xu and Joshua Zhexue Huang (2012)
		doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2011.06.004 extends this concept by
		grouping features and weighting the group in addition to
		weighting individual features.
