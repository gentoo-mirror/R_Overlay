		More Flexible Form of Boolean Verbose // R functions are not
		supposed to print text without giving the user the option to
		turn the printing off or on using a Boolean 'verbose' in a
		construct like 'if(verbose) print(...)'. But this black/white
		approach is rather rigid, and an approach with shades of gray
		might be more appropriate in many circumstances.
