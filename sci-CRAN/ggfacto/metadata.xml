		Graphs for Correspondence Analysis // Readable, complete and
		pretty graphs for correspondence analysis made with
		'FactoMineR'. They can be rendered as interactive 'HTML' plots,
		showing useful informations at mouse hover. The interest is not
		mainly visual but statistical: it helps the reader to keep in
		mind the data contained in the cross-table or Burt table while
		reading the correspondence analysis, thus preventing over-
		interpretation. Most graphs are made with 'ggplot2', which
		means that you can use the + syntax to manually add as many
		graphical pieces you want, or change theme elements. 3D graphs
		are made with 'plotly'.
