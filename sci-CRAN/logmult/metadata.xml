		Log-Multiplicative Models, Including Association Models //
		Functions to fit log-multiplicative models using 'gnm', with
		support for convenient printing, plots, and jackknife/bootstrap
		standard errors. For complex survey data, models can be fitted
		from design objects from the 'survey' package. Currently
		supported models include UNIDIFF (Erikson  Goldthorpe), a.k.a.
		log-multiplicative layer effect model (Xie), and several
		association models: Goodman's row-column association models of
		the RC(M) and RC(M)-L families with one or several dimensions;
		two skew-symmetric association models proposed by Yamaguchi and
		by van der Heijden  Mooijaart. Functions allow computing the
		intrinsic association coefficient (and therefore the Altham
		index), including via the Bayes shrinkage estimator proposed by
		Zhou; and the RAS/IPF/Deming-Stephan algorithm.
