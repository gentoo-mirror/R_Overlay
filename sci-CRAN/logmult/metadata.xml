		Log-Multiplicative Models, Including Association Models //
		Functions to fit log-multiplicative models using gnm, with
		support for convenient printing, plots, and jackknife/bootstrap
		standard errors. For complex survey data, models can be fitted
		from design objects from the 'survey' package. Currently
		supported models include UNIDIFF (Erikson  Goldthorpe), a.k.a.
		log-multiplicative layer effect model (Xie), and several
		association models: Goodman's row-column association models of
		the RC(M) and RC(M)-L families with one or several dimensions;
		two skew-symmetric association models proposed by Yamaguchi and
		by van der Heijden  Mooijaart.
