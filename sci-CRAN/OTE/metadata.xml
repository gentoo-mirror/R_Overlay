		Optimal Trees Ensembles for Regression, Classification and Class
		Membership Probability Estimation // Functions for creating
		ensembles of optimal trees for regression, classification
		(Khan, Z., Gul, A., Perperoglou, A., Miftahuddin, M., Mahmoud,
		O., Adler, W.,  Lausen, B. (2019). (2019)
		doi:10.1007/s11634-019-00364-9) and class membership
		probability estimation (Khan, Z, Gul, A, Mahmoud, O,
		Miftahuddin, M, Perperoglou, A, Adler, W  Lausen, B (2016)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-25226-1_34) are given. A few trees are
		selected from an initial set of trees grown by random forest
		for the ensemble on the basis of their individual and
		collective performance. Three different methods of tree
		selection for the case of classification are given. The
		prediction functions return estimates of the test responses and
		their class membership probabilities. Unexplained variations,
		error rates, confusion matrix, Brier scores, etc. are also
		returned for the test data.
