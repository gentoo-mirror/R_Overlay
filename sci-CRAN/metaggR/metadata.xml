		Calculate the Knowledge-Weighted Estimate // According to a
		phenomenon known as "the wisdom of the crowds," combining point
		estimates from multiple judges often provides a more accurate
		aggregate estimate than using a point estimate from a single
		judge. However, if the judges use shared information in their
		estimates, the simple average will over-emphasize this common
		component at the expense of the judges private information. Asa
		Palley  Ville Satop (2021) "Boosting the Wisdom of Crowds
		Within a Single Judgment Problem: Selective Averaging Based on
		Peer Predictions"
		https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504286
		proposes a procedure for calculating a weighted average of the
		judges individual estimates such that resulting aggregate
		estimate appropriately combines the judges' collective
		information within a single estimation problem. The authors use
		both simulation and data from six experimental studies to
		illustrate that the weighting procedure outperforms existing
		averaging-like methods, such as the equally weighted average,
		trimmed average, and median. This aggregate estimate -- know as
		"the knowledge-weighted estimate" -- inputs a) judges'
		estimates of a continuous outcome (E) and b) predictions of
		others' average estimate of this outcome (P). In this
		R-package, the function knowledge_weighted_estimate(E,P)
		implements the knowledge-weighted estimate. Its use is
		illustrated with a simple stylized example and on real-world
		experimental data.
