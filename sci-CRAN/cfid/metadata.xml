		Identification of Counterfactual Queries in Causal Models //
		Facilitates the identification of counterfactual queries in
		structural causal models via the ID* and IDC* algorithms by
		Shpitser, I. and Pearl, J. (2008)
		https://jmlr.org/papers/v9/shpitser08a.html. Provides a simple
		interface for defining causal graphs and counterfactual
		conjunctions. Construction of parallel worlds graphs and
		counterfactual graphs is done automatically based on the
		counterfactual query and the causal graph.
