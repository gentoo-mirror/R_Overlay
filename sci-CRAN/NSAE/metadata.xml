		Nonstationary Small Area Estimation // Executes nonstationary
		Fay-Herriot model and nonstationary generalized linear mixed
		model for small area estimation.The empirical best linear
		unbiased predictor (EBLUP) under stationary and nonstationary
		Fay-Herriot models and empirical best predictor (EBP) under
		nonstationary generalized linear mixed model along with the
		mean squared error estimation are included. EBLUP for
		prediction of non-sample area is also included under both
		stationary and nonstationary Fay-Herriot models. This extension
		to the Fay-Herriot model that accounts for the presence  of
		spatial nonstationarity was developed by Hukum Chandra, Nicola
		Salvati and Ray Chambers (2015) doi:10.1093/jssam/smu026 and
		nonstationary generalized linear mixed model was developed by
		Hukum  Chandra, Nicola Salvati and Ray Chambers (2017)
		doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.004. This package is dedicated to
		the memory of Dr. Hukum Chandra who passed away while the
		package creation was in progress.
