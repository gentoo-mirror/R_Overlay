		Robust Regression and Estimation Through Maximum Mean Discrepancy
		Minimization // The functions in this package compute robust
		estimators by minimizing a kernel-based distance known as MMD
		(Maximum Mean Discrepancy) between the sample and a statistical
		model. Recent works proved that these estimators enjoy a
		universal consistency property, and are extremely robust to
		outliers. Various optimization algorithms are implemented:
		stochastic gradient is available for most models, but the
		package also allows gradient descent in a few models for which
		an exact formula is available for the gradient. In terms of
		distribution fit, a large number of continuous and discrete
		distributions are available: Gaussian, exponential, uniform,
		gamma, Poisson, geometric, etc. In terms of regression, the
		models available are: linear, logistic, gamma, beta and
		Poisson. Alquier, P. and Gerber, M. (2024)
