		Spatial Transcriptomics Distance Calculation and Visualization //
		Analysis of spatial relationships between cell types in spatial
		transcriptomics data. Spatial proximity is a critical factor in
		cell-cell communication. The package calculates nearest
		neighbor distances between specified cell types and provides
		visualization tools to explore spatial patterns. Applications
		include studying cell-cell interactions, immune
		microenvironment characterization, and spatial organization of
		tissues.
