		Statistical Methods for Auditing // Provides statistical methods
		for auditing as implemented in JASP for Audit (Derks et al.,
		2021 doi:10.21105/joss.02733). First, the package makes it easy
		for an auditor to plan a statistical sample, select the sample
		from the population, and evaluate the misstatement in the
		sample compliant with international auditing standards. Second,
		the package provides statistical methods for auditing data,
		including tests of digit distributions and repeated values.
		Finally, the package includes methods for auditing algorithms
		on the aspect of fairness and bias. Next to classical
		statistical methodology, the package implements Bayesian
		equivalents of these methods whose statistical underpinnings
		are described in Derks et al. (2021) doi:10.1111/ijau.12240,
		Derks et al. (2021) doi:10.31234/osf.io/kzqp5, and Derks et al.
		(2022) doi:10.31234/osf.io/8nf3e.
