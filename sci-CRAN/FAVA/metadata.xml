		Quantify Compositional Variability Across Relative Abundance
		Vectors // Implements the statistic FAVA, an Fst-based
		Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative
		Abundances, as well as a suite of helper functions which enable
		the visualization and statistical analysis of relative
		abundance data. The 'FAVA' R package accompanies the paper,
		Quantifying compositional variability in microbial communities
		with FAVA by Morrison, Xue, and Rosenberg (2025)
