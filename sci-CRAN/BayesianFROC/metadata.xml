		FROC Analysis by Bayesian Approaches // Provides new methods for
		the so-called Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic
		(FROC) analysis. The ultimate aim of FROC analysis is to
		compare observer performances, which means comparing
		characteristics, such as area under the curve (AUC) or figure
		of merit (FOM). In this package, we only use the notion of AUC
		for modality comparison, where by "modality",  we mean imaging
		methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
		Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), ..., etc.
		So there is a problem that which imaging method is better to
		detect lesions from shadows in radiographs. To solve modality
		comparison issues, this package provides new methods using
		hierarchical Bayesian models proposed by the author of this
		package. Using this package, one can obtain at least one
		conclusion that which imaging methods are better for finding
		lesions in radiographs with the case of your data. Fitting FROC
		statistical models is sometimes not so good, it can easily
		confirm by drawing FROC curves and comparing these curves and
		the points constructed by False Positive fractions (FPFs) and
		True Positive Fractions (TPFs), we can validate the goodness of
		fit intuitively. Such validation is also implemented by the Chi
		square goodness of fit statistics in the Bayesian context which
		means that the parameter is not deterministic, thus by
		integrating it with the posterior predictive measure, we get a
		desired value. To compare modalities (imaging methods: MRI, CT,
		PET, ... , etc),  we evaluate AUCs for each modality. FROC is
		developed by Dev Chakraborty, his FROC model in his 1989 paper
		relies on the maximal likelihood methodology. The author
		modified and provided the alternative Bayesian FROC model.
		Strictly speaking, his model does not coincide with models in
		this package. In FROC context, we means by multiple reader and
		multiple case (MRMC) the case of the number of reader or
		modality is two or more. The MRMC data is available for
		functions of this package. I hope that medical researchers use
		not only the frequentist method but also alternative Bayesian
		methods. In medical research, many problems are considered
		under only frequentist methods, such as the notion of p-values.
		But p-value is sometimes misunderstood. Bayesian methods
		provide very simple, direct, intuitive answer for research
		questions. Combining frequentist methods with Bayesian methods,
		we can obtain more reliable answer for research questions.
