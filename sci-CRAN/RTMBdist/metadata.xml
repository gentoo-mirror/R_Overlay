		Distributions Compatible with Automatic Differentiation by 'RTMB'
		// Extends the functionality of the 'RTMB'
		https://kaskr.r-universe.dev/RTMB package by providing a
		collection of non-standard probability distributions compatible
		with automatic differentiation (AD). While 'RTMB' enables
		flexible and efficient modelling, including random effects, its
		built-in support is limited to standard distributions. The
		package adds additional AD-compatible distributions, broadening
		the range of models that can be implemented and estimated using
		'RTMB'. Automatic differentiation and Laplace approximation are
		described in Kristensen et al. (2016)
