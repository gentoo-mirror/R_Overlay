		Implementing Methods for Spatial Fuzzy Unsupervised
		Classification // Provides functions to apply spatial fuzzy
		unsupervised classification, visualize and interpret results.
		This method is well suited when the user wants to analyze data
		with a fuzzy clustering algorithm and to account for the
		spatial dimension of the dataset. Indexes for estimating the
		spatial consistency and classification quality are proposed in
		addition. The methods were originally proposed in the field of
		brain imagerie (seed Cai and al. 2007
		doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2006.07.011 and Zaho and al. 2013
		doi:10.1016/j.dsp.2012.09.016) and recently applied in
		geography (see Gelb and Apparicio doi:10.4000/cybergeo.36414).
