		Martingale Dependence Tools and Testing for Mixture Cure Models
		// Computes martingale difference correlation (MDC), martingale
		difference divergence, and their partial extensions to assess
		conditional mean dependence. The methods are based on Shao and
		Zhang (2014) doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.887012. Additionally,
		introduces a novel hypothesis test for evaluating covariate
		effects on the cure rate in mixture cure models, using MDC-
		based statistics. The methodology is described in Monroy-
		Castillo et al. (2025, manuscript submitted).
