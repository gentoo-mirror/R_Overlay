		Interpolation and Extrapolation for Species Diversity // Provides
		simple functions to compute and plot two types (sample-size-
		and coverage-based) rarefaction and extrapolation curves for
		species diversity (Hill numbers) based on individual-based
		abundance data or sampling-unit- based incidence data; see Chao
		and others (2014, Ecological Monographs) for pertinent theory
		and methodologies, and Hsieh, Ma and Chao (2016, Methods in
		Ecology and Evolution) for an introduction of the R package.
