		Maximizing Polyclonal Selection Gains Using Integer Programming
		// Implements an Integer Programming-based method for
		optimising genetic gain in polyclonal selection, where the goal
		is to select a group of genotypes that jointly meet multi-trait
		selection criteria. The method uses predictors of genotypic
		effects obtained from the fitting of mixed models. Its
		application is demonstrated with grapevine data, but is
		applicable to other species and breeding contexts. For more
		details see Surgy et al. (2025) doi:10.1007/s00122-025-04885-0.
