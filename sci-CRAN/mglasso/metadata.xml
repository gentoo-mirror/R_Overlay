		Multiscale Graphical Lasso // Inference of Multiscale graphical
		models with neighborhood selection approach.  The method is
		based on solving a convex optimization problem combining a
		Lasso and fused-group Lasso penalties.  This allows to infer
		simultaneously a conditional independence graph and a
		clustering partition. The optimization is based on the
		Continuation with Nesterov smoothing in a Shrinkage-
		Thresholding Algorithm solver (Hadj-Selem et al. 2018)
		doi:10.1109/TMI.2018.2829802 implemented in python.
