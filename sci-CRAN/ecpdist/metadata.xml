		Extended Chen-Poisson Lifetime Distribution // Computes the
		Extended Chen-Poisson (ecp) distribution, survival, density,
		hazard, cumulative hazard and quantile functions. It also
		allows to generate a pseudo-random sample from this
		distribution. The corresponding graphics are available.
		Functions to obtain measures of skewness and kurtosis, k-th raw
		moments, conditional k-th moments and mean residual life
		function were added. For details about ecp distribution, see
		Sousa-Ferreira, I., Abreu, A.M.  Rocha, C. (2023).
