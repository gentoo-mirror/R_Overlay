		Model-Based Clustering via Matrix-Variate Mixture Models //
		Implements finite mixtures of matrix-variate contaminated
		normal distributions via expectation conditional-maximization
		algorithm for model-based clustering, as described in Tomarchio
		et al.(2020) arXiv:2005.03861. One key advantage of this model
		is the ability to automatically detect potential outlying
		matrices by computing their a posteriori probability of being
		typical or atypical points. Finite mixtures of matrix-variate t
		and matrix-variate normal distributions are also implemented by
		using expectation-maximization algorithms.
