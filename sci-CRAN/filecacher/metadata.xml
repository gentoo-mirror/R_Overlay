		File Cacher // The main functions in this package are
		with_cache() and cached_read(). The former is a simple way to
		cache an R object into a file on disk, using 'cachem'. The
		latter is a wrapper around any standard read function, but
		caches both the output and the file list info. If the input
		file list info hasn't changed, the cache is used; otherwise,
		the original files are re-read. This can save time if the
		original operation requires reading from many files, and/or
		involves lots of processing.
