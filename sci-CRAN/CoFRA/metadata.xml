		Complete Functional Regulation Analysis // Calculates complete
		functional regulation analysis and visualize the results in a
		single heatmap. The provided example data is for biological
		data but the methodology can be used for large data sets to
		compare quantitative entities that can be grouped. For example,
		a store might divide entities into cloth, food, car products
		etc and want to see how sales changes in the groups after some
		event. The theoretical background for the calculations are
		provided in New insights into functional regulation in MS-based
		drug profiling, Ana Sofia Carvalho, Henrik Molina  Rune
