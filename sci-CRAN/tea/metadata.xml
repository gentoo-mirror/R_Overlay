		Threshold Estimation Approaches // Different approaches for
		selecting the threshold in generalized Pareto distributions.
		Most of them are based on minimizing the AMSE-criterion or at
		least by reducing the bias of the assumed GPD-model. Others are
		heuristically motivated by searching for stable sample paths,
		i.e. a nearly constant region of the tail index estimator with
		respect to k, which is the number of data in the tail. The
		third class is motivated by graphical inspection. In addition,
		a sequential testing procedure for GPD-GoF-tests is also
		implemented here.
