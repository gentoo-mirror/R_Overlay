		LIME-Based Explanations with Interpretable Inputs Based on
		Ceteris Paribus Profiles // Local explanations of machine
		learning models describe, how features contributed to a single
		prediction. This package implements an explanation method based
		on LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, see
		Tulio Ribeiro, Singh, Guestrin (2016)
		doi:10.1145/2939672.2939778) in which interpretable inputs are
		created based on local rather than global behaviour of each
		original feature.
