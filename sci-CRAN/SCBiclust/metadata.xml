		Identifies Mean, Variance, and Hierarchically Clustered
		Biclusters // Identifies a bicluster, a submatrix of the data
		such that the features and observations within the submatrix
		differ from those not contained in submatrix, using a two-step
		method. In the first step, observations in the bicluster are
		identified to maximize the sum of weighted between cluster
		feature differences. The observations are identified in a
		similar fashion as in Witten and Tibshirani (2010)
		doi:10.1198/jasa.2010.tm09415 except with a modified objective
		function and no feature sparsity constraint. In the second
		step, features in the bicluster are identified based on their
		contribution to the clustering of the observations. The cluster
		significance test of Liu, Hayes, Nobel, and Marron (2008):
		doi:10.1198/016214508000000454 can then be used to test the
		strength of the identified bicluster. 'SCBiclust' can be used
		to identify biclusters which differ based on feature means,
		feature variances, or more general differences.
