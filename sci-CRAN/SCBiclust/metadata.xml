		Identifies Mean, Variance, and Hierarchically Clustered
		Biclusters // Identifies a bicluster, a submatrix of the data
		such that the features and observations within the submatrix
		differ from those not contained in submatrix, using a two-step
		method. In the first step, observations in the bicluster are
		identified to maximize the sum of weighted between cluster
		feature differences. The method is described in Helgeson et al.
		(2020) doi:10.1111/biom.13136. 'SCBiclust' can be used to
		identify biclusters which differ based on feature means,
		feature variances, or more general differences.
