		Some Distributions from the 'Boost' Library and More // Make some
		distributions from the 'C++' library 'Boost' available in 'R'.
		In addition, the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution and the
		generalized inverse Gaussian distribution are provided. The
		distributions are represented by 'R6' classes. The method to
		sample from the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution is
		the one given in "Random variate generation for the generalized
		inverse Gaussian distribution" Luc Devroye (2012)
