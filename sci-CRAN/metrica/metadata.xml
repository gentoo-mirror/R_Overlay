		Prediction Performance Metrics // A compilation of more than 40
		functions designed to evaluate prediction performance of point-
		forecast models accounting for different aspects of the
		agreement between predicted and observed values. It includes
		error metrics (e.g. MAE, RMSE), model efficiencies (e.g. NSE,
		KGE), indices of agreement (e.g. d, RAC), goodness of fit (e.g.
		r, R2), concordance correlation (e.g. CCC), error decomposition
		(e.g. lack of accuracy-precision), and plots the visualize
		agreement. For more details visit the vignettes
