		Prediction Performance Metrics // A compilation of more than 80
		functions designed to quantitatively and visually evaluate
		prediction performance of regression (continuous variables) and
		classification (categorical variables) of point-forecast models
		(e.g. APSIM, DSSAT, DNDC, supervised Machine Learning). For
		regression, it includes functions to generate plots (scatter,
		tiles, density,  Bland-Altman plot), and to estimate error
		metrics (e.g. MBE, MAE, RMSE), error decomposition (e.g. lack
		of accuracy-precision), model efficiency (e.g. NSE, E1, KGE),
		indices of agreement (e.g. d, RAC), goodness of fit (e.g. r,
		R2), adjusted correlation coefficients (e.g. CCC, dcorr),
		symmetric regression coefficients (intercept, slope), and mean
		absolute scaled error (MASE) for time series predictions. For
		classification (binomial and multinomial), it offers functions
		to generate and plot confusion matrices, and to estimate
		performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
		specificity, F-score, Cohen's Kappa, G-mean, and many more. For
		more details visit the vignettes
