		Utility Functions for Parametric Multi-State Models // Provides
		functions for working with multi-state modelling, such as
		efficient simulation routines for estimating transition
		probabilities and length of stay. It is designed as an
		extension to multi-state modelling capabilities provided with
		the 'flexsurv' package (see Jackson (2016)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i08).
