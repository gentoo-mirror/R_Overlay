		Utilities for Graphical Rendering and Fonts Management // Tools
		are provided to compute metrics of formatted strings and to
		check the availability of a font. Another set of functions is
		provided to support the collection of fonts from 'Google Fonts'
		in a cache. Their use is simple within 'R Markdown' documents
		and 'shiny' applications but also with graphic productions
		generated with the 'ggiraph', 'ragg' and 'svglite' packages or
		with tabular productions from the 'flextable' package.
