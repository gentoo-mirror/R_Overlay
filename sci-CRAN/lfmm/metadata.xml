		Latent Factor Mixed Models // Fast and accurate inference of
		gene-environment associations (GEA) in genome-wide studies
		(Caye et al., 2019, doi:10.1093/molbev/msz008). We developed a
		least-squares estimation approach for confounder and effect
		sizes estimation that provides a unique framework for several
		categories of genomic data, not restricted to genotypes. The
		speed of the new algorithm is several times faster than the
		existing GEA approaches, then our previous version of the
		'LFMM' program present in the 'LEA' package (Frichot and
		Francois, 2015, doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12382).
