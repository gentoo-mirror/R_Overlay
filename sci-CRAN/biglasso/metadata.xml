		Extending Lasso Model Fitting to Big Data // Extend lasso and
		elastic-net model fitting for ultra high-dimensional, multi-
		gigabyte data sets that cannot be loaded into memory. Designed
		to be more memory- and computation-efficient than existing
		lasso-fitting packages like 'glmnet' and 'ncvreg', thus
		allowing the user to analyze big data analysis even on an
		ordinary laptop.
