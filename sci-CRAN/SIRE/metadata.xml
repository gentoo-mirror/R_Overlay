		Finding Feedback Effects in SEM and Testing for Their
		Significance // Provides two main functionalities. 1 - Given a
		system of simultaneous equation, it decomposes  the matrix of
		coefficients weighting the endogenous variables into three
		submatrices: one includes the subset of coefficients that have
		a causal nature in the model, two include the subset of
		coefficients that have a interdependent nature in the model,
		either at systematic level or induced by the correlation
		between error terms. 2 - Given a decomposed model, it tests for
		the significance of the interdependent relationships acting in
		the system, via Maximum likelihood and Wald test, which can be
		built starting from the function output. For theoretical
		reference see Faliva (1992) doi:10.1007/BF02589085 and Faliva
		and Zoia (1994) doi:10.1007/BF02589041.
