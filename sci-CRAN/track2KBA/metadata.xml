		Identifying Important Areas from Animal Tracking Data //
		Functions for preparing and analyzing animal tracking data,
		with the intention of identifying areas which are potentially
		important at the population level and therefore of conservation
		interest. Areas identified using this package may be checked
		against global or regionally-defined criteria, such as those
		set by the Key Biodiversity Area program. The method published
		herein is an optimized and updated version of the method
		described in Lascelles et al. 2016 doi:10.1111/ddi.12411.
