		Identifying Important Areas from Animal Tracking Data //
		Functions for preparing and analyzing animal tracking data,
		with the intention of identifying areas which are potentially
		important at the population level and therefore of conservation
		interest. Areas identified using this package may be checked
		against global or regionally-defined criteria, such as those
		set by the Key Biodiversity Area program. The method published
		herein is described in full in Beal et al. 2021
