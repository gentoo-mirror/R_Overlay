		Quantile Kriging for Stochastic Simulations with Replication // A
		re-implementation of quantile kriging. Quantile kriging was
		described by Plumlee and Tuo (2014)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.2013.860919.  With computational savings
		when dealing with replication from the recent paper by Binois,
		Gramacy, and Ludovski (2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1458625
		it is now possible to apply quantile kriging to a wider class
		of problems.  In addition to fitting the model, other useful
		tools are provided such as the ability to automatically perform
		leave-one-out cross validation.
