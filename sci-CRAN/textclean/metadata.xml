		Text Cleaning Tools // Tools to clean and process text.  Tools
		are geared at checking for substrings that are not optimal for
		analysis and replacing or removing them (normalizing) with more
		analysis friendly substrings (see Sproat, Black, Chen, Kumar,
		Ostendorf,  Richards (2001) doi:10.1006/csla.2001.0169). For
		example, emoticons are often used in text but not always easily
		handled by analysis algorithms.  The 'replace_emoticon()'
		function replaces emoticons with word equivalents.
