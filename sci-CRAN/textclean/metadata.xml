		Text Cleaning Tools // Tools to clean and process text.  Tools
		are geared at checking for substrings that are not optimal for
		analysis and replacing or removing them with more analysis
		friendly substrings.  For example, emoticons are often used in
		text but not always easily handled by analysis algorithms.  The
		'replace_emoticon' function replaces emoticons with word
		equivalents.
