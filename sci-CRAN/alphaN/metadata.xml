		Set Alpha Based on Sample Size Using Bayes Factors // Sets the
		alpha level for coefficients in a regression model as a
		decreasing function of the sample size through the use of
		Jeffreys' Approximate Bayes factor. You tell alphaN() your
		sample size, and it tells you to which value you must lower
		alpha to avoid Lindley's Paradox. For details, see Wulff and
		Taylor (2023) doi:10.31234/osf.io/3cbh7.
