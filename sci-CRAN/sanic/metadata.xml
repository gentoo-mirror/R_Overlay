		Solving Ax = b Nimbly in C++ // Routines for solving large
		systems of linear equations and eigenproblems in R. Direct and
		iterative solvers from the Eigen C++ library are made
		available. Solvers include Cholesky, LU, QR, and Krylov
		subspace methods (Conjugate Gradient, BiCGSTAB). Dense and
		sparse problems are supported.
