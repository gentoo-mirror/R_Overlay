		Similarity-First Search Seriation Algorithm // An implementation
		of the Similarity-First Search algorithm (SFS), a combinatorial
		algorithm which can be used to solve the seriation problem and
		to recognize some structured weighted graphs. The SFS algorithm
		represents a generalization to weighted graphs of the graph
		search algorithm Lexicographic Breadth-First Search (Lex-BFS),
		a variant of Breadth-First Search. The SFS algorithm reduces to
		Lex-BFS when applied to binary matrices (or, equivalently,
		unweighted graphs). Hence this library can be also considered
		for Lex-BFS applications such as recognition of graph classes
		like chordal or unit interval graphs. In fact, the SFS
		seriation algorithm implemented in this package is a multisweep
		algorithm, which consists in repeating a finite number of SFS
		iterations (at most \eqn{n} sweeps for a matrix of size
		\eqn{n}). If the data matrix has a Robinsonian structure, then
		the ranking returned by the multistep SFS algorithm is a
		Robinson ordering of the input matrix. Otherwise the algorithm
		can be used as a heuristic to return a ranking partially
		satisfying the Robinson property.
