		Survival Support Vector Analysis // Performs support vectors
		analysis for data sets with survival outcome. Three approaches
		are available in the package: The regression approach takes
		censoring into account when formulating the inequality
		constraints of the support vector problem. In the ranking
		approach, the inequality constraints set the objective to
		maximize the concordance index for comparable pairs of
		observations. The hybrid approach combines the regression and
		ranking constraints in the same model.
