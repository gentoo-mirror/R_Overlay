		Calculator of Understandability Metrics for BPMN // Calculate
		several understandability metrics of BPMN models. BPMN stands
		for business process modelling notation and is a language for
		expressing business processes into business process diagrams.
		Examples of these understandability metrics are: average
		connector degree, maximum connector degree, sequentiality,
		cyclicity, diameter, depth, token split, control flow
		complexity, connector mismatch, connector heterogeneity,
		separability, structuredness and cross connectivity. See R
		documentation and paper on metric implementation included in
		this package for more information concerning the metrics.
