		Market Matching and Causal Impact Inference // For a given test
		market find the best control markets using time series matching
		and analyze the impact of an intervention. The intervention
		could be be a marketing event or some other local business
		tactic that is being tested. The workflow implemented in
		MarketMatching utilizes dynamic time warping (the dtw package)
		to do the matching and the CausalImpact package to analyze the
		causal impact. In fact, this package can be considered a
		"workflow wrapper" for those two packages.
