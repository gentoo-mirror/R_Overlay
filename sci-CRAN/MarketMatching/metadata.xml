		Market Matching and Causal Impact Inference // For a given test
		market find the best control markets using time series matching
		and analyze the impact of an intervention. The intervention
		could be a marketing event or some other local business tactic
		that is being tested. The workflow implemented in the Market
		Matching package utilizes dynamic time warping (the 'dtw'
		package) to do the matching and the 'CausalImpact' package to
		analyze the causal impact. In fact, this package can be
		considered a "workflow wrapper" for those two packages. In
		addition, if you don't have a chosen set of test markets to
		match, the Market Matching package can provide suggested
		test/control market pairs and pseudo prospective power analysis
		(measuring causal impact at fake interventions).
