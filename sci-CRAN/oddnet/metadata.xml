		Anomaly Detection in Temporal Networks // Anomaly detection in
		dynamic, temporal networks. The package 'oddnet' uses a
		feature-based method to identify anomalies. First, it computes
		many features for each network. Then it models the features
		using time series methods. Using time series residuals it
		detects anomalies. This way, the temporal dependencies are
		accounted for when identifying anomalies (Kandanaarachchi,
		Hyndman 2022) arXiv:2210.07407.
