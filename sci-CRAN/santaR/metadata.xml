		Short Asynchronous Time-Series Analysis // A graphical and
		automated pipeline for the analysis of short time-series in R
		('santaR'). This approach is designed to accommodate
		asynchronous time sampling (i.e. different time points for
		different individuals), inter-individual variability, noisy
		measurements and large numbers of variables. Based on a
		smoothing splines functional model, 'santaR' is able to detect
		variables highlighting significantly different temporal
		trajectories between study groups. Designed initially for
		metabolic phenotyping, 'santaR' is also suited for other
		Systems Biology disciplines. Command line and graphical
		analysis (via a 'shiny' application) enable fast and parallel
		automated analysis and reporting, intuitive visualisation and
		comprehensive plotting options for non-specialist users.
