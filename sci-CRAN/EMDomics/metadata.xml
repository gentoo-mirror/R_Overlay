		Earth Mover's Distance for Differential Analysis of Genomics Data
		// The EMDomics algorithm is used to perform a supervised two-
		class analysis to measure the magnitude and statistical
		significance of observed continuous genomics data between two
		groups. Usually the data will be gene expression values from
		array-based or sequence-based experiments, but data from other
		types of experiments can also be analyzed (e.g. copy number
		variation). Traditional methods like Significance Analysis of
		Microarrays (SAM) and Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA)
		use significance tests based on summary statistics (mean and
		standard deviation) of the two distributions. This approach
		lacks power to identify expression differences between groups
		that show high levels of intra-group heterogeneity. The Earth
		Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the "work"
		needed to transform one distribution into the other, thus
		providing a metric of the overall difference in shape between
		two distributions. Permutation of sample labels is used to
		generate q-values for the observed EMD scores.
