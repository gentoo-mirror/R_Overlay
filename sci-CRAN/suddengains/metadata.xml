		Identify Sudden Gains in Longitudinal Data // Identify sudden
		gains based on the criteria outlined by Tang and DeRubeis
		(1999) doi:10.1037/0022-006X.67.6.894. Sudden losses, defined
		as the opposite of sudden gains can also be identified. It
		applies all three criteria to a dataset while adjusting the
		third criteria for missing values. It handles multiple gains
		per person by creating two datasets, one with all sudden gains
		and one with one selected sudden gain for each participant. It
		can extract and plot scores around sudden gains on multiple
		measures. See the GitHub repository for more information and
		examples.
