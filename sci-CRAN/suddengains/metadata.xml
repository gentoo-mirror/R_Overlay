		Identify Sudden Gains in Longitudinal Data // Identify sudden
		gains based on the three criteria outlined by Tang and DeRubeis
		(1999) doi:10.1037/0022-006X.67.6.894 to a selection of
		repeated measures. Sudden losses, defined as the opposite of
		sudden gains can also be identified. Two different datasets can
		be created, one including all sudden gains/losses and one
		including one selected sudden gain/loss for each case. It can
		extract scores around sudden gains/losses. It can plot the
		average change around sudden gains/losses and trajectories of
		individual cases.
