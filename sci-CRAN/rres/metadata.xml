		Realized Relatedness Estimation and Simulation // Functions for
		studying realized genetic relatedness between people. Users
		will be able to simulate inheritance patterns given pedigree
		structures, generate SNP marker data given inheritance
		patterns, and estimate realized relatedness between pairs of
		individuals using SNP marker data. See Wang (2017)
		doi:10.1534/genetics.116.197004. This work was supported by
		National Institutes of Health grants R37 GM-046255.
