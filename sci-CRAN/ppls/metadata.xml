		Penalized Partial Least Squares // Linear and nonlinear
		regression methods based on Partial Least Squares and
		Penalization Techniques. Model parameters are selected via
		cross-validation, and confidence intervals ans tests for the
		regression coefficients can be conducted via jackknifing. The
		method is described and applied to simulated and experimental
		data in Kraemer et al. (2008)
