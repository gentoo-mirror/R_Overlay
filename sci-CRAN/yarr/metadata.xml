		Yet Another 'ARFF' Reader // A parser and a writer for 'WEKA'
		Attribute-Relation File Format https://waikato.github.io/weka-
		wiki/arff_stable/ in pure R, with no dependencies. As opposed
		to other R implementations, this package can read standard
		(dense) as well as sparse files, i.e. those where each row does
		only contain nonzero components. Unlike 'RWeka', 'yarr' does
		not require any 'Java' installation nor is dependent on
		external software. This implementation is generalized from
		those in packages 'mldr' and 'mldr.datasets'.
