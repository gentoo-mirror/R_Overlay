		General Linear Mixed Models for Gene-Level Differential
		Expression // Using mixed effects models to analyse
		longitudinal gene expression can highlight differences between
		sample groups over time. The most widely used differential gene
		expression tools are unable to fit linear mixed effect models,
		and are less optimal for analysing longitudinal data. This
		package provides negative binomial and Gaussian mixed effects
		models to fit gene expression and other biological data across
		repeated samples. This is particularly useful for investigating
		changes in RNA-Sequencing gene expression between groups of
		individuals over time, as described in: Rivellese, F., Surace,
		A. E., Goldmann, K., Sciacca, E., Cubuk, C., Giorli, G., ...
