		General Linear Mixed Models for Gene-Level Differential
		Expression // Using random and fixed effects to model
		expression at an individual gene level can highlight
		differences between sample groups over time. The most widely
		used differential gene expression tools are unable to fit
		linear mixed effect models, therefore do not capture
		interaction terms. This package uses negative binomial mixed
		effects models to fit gene expression with matched samples.
		This is particularly useful for investigating  changes in gene
		expression between groups of individuals over time, as seen in:
