		Retrieve Reaction Rate Dynamics from Metabolite Concentration
		Time Courses // Reaction rate dynamics can be retrieved from
		metabolite concentration time courses. User has to provide
		corresponding stoichiometric matrix but not a regulation model
		(Michaelis-Menten or similar). Instead of solving an ordinary
		differential equation (ODE) system describing the evolution of
		concentrations, we use B-splines to catch the concentration and
		rate dynamics then solve a least square problem on their
		coefficients with non-negativity (and optionally monotonicity)
		constraints. Constraints can be also set on initial values of
		concentration. The package 'dynafluxr' can be used as a library
		but also as an application with command line interface
		dynafluxr::cli("-h") or graphical user interface
		dynafluxr::gui().
