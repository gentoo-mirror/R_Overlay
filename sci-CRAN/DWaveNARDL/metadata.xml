		Dual Wavelet Based NARDL Model // Dual Wavelet based Nonlinear
		Autoregressive Distributed Lag model has been developed for
		noisy time series analysis. This package is designed to capture
		both short-run and long-run relationships in time series data,
		while incorporating wavelet transformations. The methodology
		combines the NARDL model with wavelet decomposition to better
		capture the nonlinear dynamics of the series and exogenous
		variables. The package is useful for analyzing economic and
		financial time series data that exhibit both long-term trends
		and short-term fluctuations. This package has been developed
		using algorithm of Jammazi et al.
