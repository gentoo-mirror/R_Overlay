		Differential Item Functioning in Generalized Partial Credit
		Models // Provides a framework to detect Differential Item
		Functioning (DIF) in Generalized Partial Credit Models (GPCM)
		and special cases of the GPCM as proposed by Schauberger and
		Mair (2019) doi:10.3758/s13428-019-01224-2. A joint model is
		set up where DIF is explicitly parametrized and penalized
		likelihood estimation is used for parameter selection. The big
		advantage of the method called GPCMlasso is that several
		variables can be treated simultaneously and that both
		continuous and categorical variables can be used to detect DIF.
