		Recalibration Methods for Improved Clinical Utility of Risk
		Scores // Recalibrate risk scores (predicting binary outcomes)
		to improve clinical utility of risk score using weighted
		logistic or constrained logistic recalibration methods.
		Additionally, produces plots to assess the potential for
		recalibration to improve the clinical utility of a risk model.
		Methods are described in detail in Mishra, A. (2019) "Methods
		for Risk Markers that Incorporate Clinical Utility"
