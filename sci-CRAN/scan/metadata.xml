		Single-Case Data Analyses for Single and Multiple Baseline
		Designs // A collection of procedures for analysing,
		visualising, and managing single-case data. These include
		regression models (multilevel, multivariate, bayesian), between
		case standardised mean difference, overlap indices ('PND',
		'PEM', 'PAND', 'PET', 'tau-u', 'IRD', 'baseline corrected tau',
		'CDC'), and randomization tests. Data preparation functions
		support outlier detection, handling missing values, scaling,
		and custom transformations. An export function helps to
		generate html, word, and latex tables in a publication friendly
		style. A shiny app allows to use scan in a graphical user
		interface. More details can be found in the online book
		'Analyzing single-case data with R and scan', Juergen Wilbert
		(2025) https://jazznbass.github.io/scan-Book/.
