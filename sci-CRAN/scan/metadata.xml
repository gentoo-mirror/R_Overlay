		Single-Case Data Analyses for Single and Multiple Baseline
		Designs // A collection of procedures for analysing,
		visualising, and managing single-case data. These include
		piecewise linear regression models, multilevel models, overlap
		indices ('PND', 'PEM', 'PAND', 'PET', 'tau-u', 'baseline
		corrected tau', 'CDC'), and randomization tests. Data
		preparation functions support outlier detection, handling
		missing values, scaling, truncation, rank transformation, and
		smoothing. An export function helps to generate html and latex
		tables in a publication friendly style. More details can be
		found in the online book 'Analyzing single-case data with R and
		scan', Juergen Wilbert (2023) https://jazznbass.github.io/scan-
		Book/.
