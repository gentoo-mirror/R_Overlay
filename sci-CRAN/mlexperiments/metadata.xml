		Machine Learning Experiments // Provides 'R6' objects to perform
		parallelized hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation.
		Hyperparameter optimization can be performed with Bayesian
		optimization (via 'ParBayesianOptimization'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=ParBayesianOptimization) and
		grid search. The optimized hyperparameters can be validated
		using k-fold cross-validation. Alternatively, hyperparameter
		optimization and validation can be performed with nested cross-
		validation. While 'mlexperiments' focuses on core wrappers for
		machine learning experiments, additional learner algorithms can
		be supplemented by inheriting from the provided learner base
		class.
