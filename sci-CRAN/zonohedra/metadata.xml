		Compute and Plot Zonohedra from Vector Generators // Computes a
		zonohedron from real vector generators.  The package also
		computes zonogons (2D zonotopes) and zonosegs (1D zonotopes).
		An elementary S3 class for matroids is included, which supports
		matroids with rank 3, 2, and 1.  Optimization methods are taken
		from Heckbert (1985) https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/zono.ps.gz.
