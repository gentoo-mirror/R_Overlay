		Segment Data With Maximum Likelihood // Given a likelihood
		provided by the user, this package applies it to a given matrix
		dataset in order to find change points in the data that
		maximize the sum of the likelihoods of all the segments. This
		package provides a handful of algorithms with different time
		complexities and assumption compromises so the user is able to
		choose the best one for the problem at hand. The implementation
		of the segmentation algorithms in this package are based on the
		paper by Bruno M. de Castro, Florencia Leonardi (2018)
		arXiv:1501.01756. The Berlin weather sample dataset was
		provided by Deutscher Wetterdienst https://dwd.de/. You can
		find all the references in the Acknowledgments section of this
		package's repository via the URL below.
