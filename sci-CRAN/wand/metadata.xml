		Retrieve 'Magic' Attributes from Files and Directories // 'MIME'
		types are shorthand descriptors for file contents and can be
		determined from "magic" bytes in file headers, file contents or
		intuited from file extensions. Tools are provided to perform
		curated "magic" tests as well as mapping 'MIME' types from a
		database of over 1,500 extension mappings.
