		Retrieve 'Magic' Attributes from Files and Directories // The
		'libmagic' library provides functions to determine 'MIME' type
		and other metadata from files through their "magic" attributes.
		This is useful when you do not wish to rely solely on the
		honesty of a user or the extension on a file name. It also
		incorporates other metadata from the mime-db database
		https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db.
