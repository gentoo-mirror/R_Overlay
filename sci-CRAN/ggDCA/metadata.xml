		Calculate and Plot Decision Curve // Diagnostic and prognostic
		models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that
		do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic
		techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often
		require collection of additional information and may be
		cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result.
		Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating
		alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has
		advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.
		This method was described by Andrew J. Vickers (2006)
