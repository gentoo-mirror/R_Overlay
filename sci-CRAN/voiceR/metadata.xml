		Voice Analytics for Social Scientists // Simplifies and largely
		automates practical voice analytics for social science
		research. This package offers an accessible and easy-to-use
		interface, including an interactive Shiny app, that simplifies
		the processing, extraction, analysis, and reporting of voice
		recording data in the behavioral and social sciences. The
		package includes batch processing capabilities to read and
		analyze multiple voice files in parallel, automates the
		extraction of key vocal features for further analysis, and
		automatically generates APA formatted reports for typical
		between-group comparisons in experimental social science
		research. A more extensive methodological introduction that
		inspired the development of the 'voiceR' package is provided in
		Hildebrand et al. 2020 doi:10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.09.020.
