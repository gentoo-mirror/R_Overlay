		Survival Trees to Fit Left-Truncated and Right-Censored and
		Interval-Censored Survival Data // Recursive partition
		algorithms designed for fitting survival tree with left-
		truncated and right censored (LTRC) data, as well as interval-
		censored data. The LTRC trees can also be used to fit survival
		tree with time-varying covariates.
