		A Curated Collection of Biodiversity and Species Datasets and
		Utilities // Provides a curated collection of biodiversity and
		species-related datasets (birds, plants, reptiles, turtles,
		mammals, bees, marine data and related biological
		measurements), together with small utilities to load and
		explore them. The package gathers data sourced from public
		repositories (including Kaggle and well-known
		ecological/biological R packages) and standardizes access for
		researchers, educators, and data analysts working on
		biodiversity, biogeography, ecology and comparative biology. It
		aims to simplify reproducible workflows by packaging commonly
		used example datasets and metadata so they can be easily
		inspected, visualized, and used for teaching, testing, and
		prototyping analyses.
