		Dump 'R' Package Source, Documentation, and Vignettes into One
		File // Dump source code, documentation and vignettes of an 'R'
		package into a single file. Supports installed packages, tar.gz
		archives, and package source directories. If the package is not
		installed, only its source is automatically downloaded from
		CRAN for processing. The output is a single plain text file or
		a character vector, which is useful to ingest complete package
		documentation and source into a large language model (LLM) or
		pass it further to other tools, such as 'ragnar'
		https://github.com/tidyverse/ragnar to create a Retrieval-
		Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.
