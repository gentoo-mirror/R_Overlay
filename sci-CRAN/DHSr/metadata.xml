		Create Large Scale Repeated Regression Summary Statistics Dataset
		and Visualization Seamlessly // Mapping, spatial analysis, and
		statistical modeling of microdata from sources such as the
		Demographic and Health Surveys https://www.dhsprogram.com/ and
		Integrated Public Use Microdata Series https://www.ipums.org/.
		It can also be extended to other datasets. The package supports
		spatial correlation index construction and visualization, along
		with empirical Bayes approximation of regression coefficients
		in a multistage setup.  The main functionality is repeated
		regression  for example, if we have to run regression for n
		groups, the group ID should be vertically composed into the
		variable for the parameter `location_var`. It can perform
		various kinds of regression, such as Generalized Regression
		Models, logit, probit, and more. Additionally, it can
		incorporate interaction effects. The key benefit of the package
		is its ability to store the regression results performed
		repeatedly on a dataset by the group ID, along with respective
		p-values and map those estimates.
