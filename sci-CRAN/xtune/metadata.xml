		Regularized Regression with Differential Penalties Integrating
		External Information // Extends standard penalized regression
		(Lasso and Ridge) to allow differential shrinkage based on
		external information with the goal of achieving a better
		prediction accuracy. Examples of external information include
		the grouping of predictors, prior knowledge of biological
		importance, external p-values, function annotations, etc. The
		choice of multiple tuning parameters is done using an Empirical
		Bayes approach. A majorization-minimization algorithm is
		employed for implementation.
