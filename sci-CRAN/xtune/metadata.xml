		Regularized Regression with Feature-Specific Penalties
		Integrating External Information // Extends standard penalized
		regression (Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic-net) to allow feature-
		specific shrinkage based on external information with the goal
		of achieving a better prediction accuracy and variable
		selection. Examples of external information include the
		grouping of predictors, prior knowledge of biological
		importance, external p-values, function annotations, etc. The
		choice of multiple tuning parameters is done using an Empirical
		Bayes approach. A majorization-minimization algorithm is
		employed for implementation.
