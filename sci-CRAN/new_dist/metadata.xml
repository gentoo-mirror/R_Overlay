		Alternative Continuous and Discrete Distributions // The aim is
		to develop an R package, which is the 'new.dist' package, for
		the probability (density) function, the distribution function,
		the quantile function and the associated random number
		generation function for discrete and continuous distributions,
		which have recently been proposed in the literature. This
		package implements the following distributions: The Power Muth
		Distribution, a Bimodal Weibull Distribution, the Discrete
		Lindley Distribution, The Gamma-Lomax Distribution, Weighted
		Geometric Distribution, a Power Log-Dagum Distribution,
		Kumaraswamy Distribution, Lindley Distribution, the Unit-
		Inverse Gaussian Distribution, EP Distribution, Akash
		Distribution, Ishita Distribution, Maxwell Distribution, the
		Standard Omega Distribution, Slashed Generalized Rayleigh
		Distribution, Two-Parameter Rayleigh Distribution, Muth
		Distribution, Uniform-Geometric Distribution, Discrete Weibull
		Distribution.
