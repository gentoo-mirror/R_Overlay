		Multi-Objective Calibration of Hydrological Models using MOPSO //
		State-of-the-art Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimiser
		(MOPSO), based on the algorithm developed by Lin et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1109/TEVC.2016.2631279 with improvements described by
		Marinao-Rivas  Zambrano-Bigiarini (2020) doi:10.1109/LA-
		CCI48322.2021.9769844. This package is inspired by and closely
		follows the philosophy of the single objective 'hydroPSO' R
		package ((Zambrano-Bigiarini  Rojas, 2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.01.004), and can be used for global
		optimisation of non-smooth and non-linear R functions and
		R-base models (e.g., 'TUWmodel', 'GR4J', 'GR6J'). However, the
		main focus of 'hydroMOPSO' is optimising environmental and
		other real-world models that need to be run from the system
		console (e.g., 'SWAT+'). 'hydroMOPSO' communicates with the
		model to be optimised through its input and output files,
		without requiring modifying its source code. Thanks to its
		flexible design and the availability of several fine-tuning
		options, 'hydroMOPSO' can tackle a wide range of multi-
		objective optimisation problems (e.g., multi-objective
		functions, multiple model variables, multiple periods).
		Finally, 'hydroMOPSO' is designed to run on multi-core machines
		or network clusters, to alleviate the computational burden of
		complex models with long execution time.
