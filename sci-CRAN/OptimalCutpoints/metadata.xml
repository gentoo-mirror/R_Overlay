		Computing Optimal Cutpoints in Diagnostic Tests // Computes
		optimal cutpoints for diagnostic tests or continuous markers.
		Various approaches for selecting optimal cutoffs have been
		implemented, including methods based on cost-benefit analysis
		and diagnostic test accuracy measures (Sensitivity/Specificity,
		Predictive Values and Diagnostic Likelihood Ratios). Numerical
		and graphical output for all methods is easily obtained.
