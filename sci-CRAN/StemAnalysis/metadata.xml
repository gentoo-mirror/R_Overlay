		Reconstructing Tree Growth and Carbon Accumulation with Stem
		Analysis Data // Use stem analysis data to reconstructing tree
		growth and carbon accumulation. Users can independently or in
		combination perform a number of standard tasks for any tree
		species. (i) Age class determination. (ii) The cumulative
		growth, mean annual increment, and current annual increment of
		diameter at breast height (DBH) with bark, tree height, and
		stem volume with bark are estimated. (iii) Tree biomass and
		carbon storage estimation from volume and allometric models are
		calculated. (iv) Height-diameter relationship is fitted with
		nonlinear models, if diameter at breast height (DBH) or tree
		height are available, which can be used to retrieve tree height
		and diameter at breast height (DBH).
