		Moon Charts, a Pie Chart Alternative // Moon charts are like pie
		charts except that the proportions are shown as crescent or
		gibbous portions of a circle, like the lit and unlit portions
		of the moon. As such, they work best with only one or two
		groups. 'gggibbous' extends 'ggplot2' to allow for plotting
		multiple moon charts in a single panel and does not require a
		square coordinate system.
