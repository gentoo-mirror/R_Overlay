		Predicting Species Accumulation Curves // Originally as an R
		version of Preseq doi:10.1038/nmeth.2375, the package has
		extended its functionality to predict the r-species
		accumulation curve (r-SAC), which is the number of species
		represented at least r times as a function of the sampling
		effort. When r = 1, the curve is known as the species
		accumulation curve, or the library complexity curve in high-
		throughput genomic sequencing. The package includes both
		parametric and nonparametric methods, as described by Deng C,
		et al. (2018) arXiv:1607.02804v3.
