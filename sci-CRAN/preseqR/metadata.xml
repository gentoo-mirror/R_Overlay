		Predicting the Number of Species in a Random Sample // The
		relation between the number of species and the number of
		individuals in a random sample is a classic problem back to
		Fisher (1943) doi:10.2307/1411. We generalize this problem to
		estimate the number of species represented at least r times in
		a random sample. In particular when r=1, it becomes the classic
		problem. We use a mixture of Poisson processes to model
		sampling procedures and apply a nonparametric empirical Bayes
		approach to obtain an estimator. For more information on
		preseqR, see Deng C, Daley T and Smith AD (2015)
