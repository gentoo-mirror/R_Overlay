		Mexican Politics-Inspired Color Palette Generator // A color
		palette generator inspired by Mexican politics, with colors
		ranging from red on the left to gray in the middle and green on
		the right. Palette options range from only a few colors to
		several colors, but with discrete and continuous options to
		offer greatest flexibility to the user. This package allows for
		a range of applications, from mapping brief discrete scales
		(e.g., four colors for Morena, PRI, and PAN) to continuous
		interpolated arrays including dozens of shades graded from red
		to green.
