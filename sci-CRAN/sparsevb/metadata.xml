		Spike-and-Slab Variational Bayes for Linear and Logistic
		Regression // Implements variational Bayesian algorithms to
		perform scalable variable selection for sparse, high-
		dimensional linear and logistic regression models. Features
		include a novel prioritized updating scheme, which uses a
		preliminary estimator of the variational means during
		initialization to generate an updating order prioritizing
		large, more relevant, coefficients. Sparsity is induced via
		spike-and-slab priors with either Laplace or Gaussian slabs. By
		default, the heavier-tailed Laplace density is used. Formal
		derivations of the algorithms and asymptotic consistency
		results may be found in Kolyan Ray and Botond Szabo (2020)

		and Gabriel Clara (2020) arXiv:2010.11665.
