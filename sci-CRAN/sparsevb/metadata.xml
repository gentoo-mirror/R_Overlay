		Spike-and-Slab Variational Bayes for Linear and Logistic
		Regression // Implements variational Bayesian algorithms to
		perform scalable variable selection for sparse, high-
		dimensional linear and logistic regression models. Features
		include a novel prioritized updating scheme, which uses a
		preliminary estimator of the variational means during
		initialization to generate an updating order prioritizing
		large, more relevant, coefficients. Sparsity is induced via
		spike-and-slab priors with either Laplace or Gaussian slabs. By
		default, the heavier-tailed Laplace density is used. Formal
		derivations of the algorithms and asymptotic consistency
		results may be found in Kolyan Ray and Botond Szabo (JASA 2020)
		and Kolyan Ray, Botond Szabo, and Gabriel Clara (NeurIPS 2020).
