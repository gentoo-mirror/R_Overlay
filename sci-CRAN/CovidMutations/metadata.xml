		Mutation Analysis Toolkit for COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)
		// A feasible framework for mutation analysis and reverse
		transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
		evaluation of COVID-19, including mutation profile
		visualization, statistics and mutation ratio of each assay. The
