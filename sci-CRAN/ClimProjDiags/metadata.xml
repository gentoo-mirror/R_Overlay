		Set of Tools to Compute Various Climate Indices // Set of tools
		to compute metrics and indices for climate analysis. The
		package provides functions to compute extreme indices, evaluate
		the agreement between models and combine theses models into an
		ensemble. Multi-model time series of climate indices can be
		computed either after averaging the 2-D fields from different
		models provided they share a common grid or by combining time
		series computed on the model native grid. Indices can be
		assigned weights and/or combined to construct new indices. The
		package makes use of some of the methods described in: N.
