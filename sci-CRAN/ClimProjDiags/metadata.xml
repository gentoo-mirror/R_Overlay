		Compute Various Climate Indices // Compute metrics and indices
		for climate analysis. The package provides functions to compute
		extreme indices, evaluate the agreement between models and
		combine theses models into an ensemble. Multi-model time series
		of climate indices can be computed either after averaging the
		2-D fields from different models provided they share a common
		grid or by combining time series computed on the model native
		grid. Indices can be assigned weights and/or combined to
		construct new indices.
