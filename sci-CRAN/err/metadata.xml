		Customizable Object Sensitive Messages // Messages should provide
		users with readable information about R objects without
		flooding their console. 'cc()' concatenates vector and data
		frame values into a grammatically correct string using commas,
		an ellipsis and conjunction. 'cn()' allows the user to define a
		string which varies based on a count. 'co()' combines the two
		to produce a customizable object aware string. The package
		further facilitates this process by providing five
		'sprintf'-like types such as '%n' for the length of an object
		and '%o' for its name as well as wrappers for pasting objects
		and issuing errors, warnings and messages.
