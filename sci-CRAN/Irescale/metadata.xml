		Calculate and Scale Moran's I // Provides a scaling method to
		obtain a standardized Moran's I measure. Moran's I is a measure
		for the spatial autocorrelation of a data set, it gives a
		measure of similarity between data and its surrounding.
		Researchers calculate Moran's I to express the spatial
		autocorrelation of their data. The range of this value must be
		[-1,1], but this does not happen in practice. This package
		scale the Moran's I value and map it into the theoretical range
		of [-1,1]. Once the Moran's I value is rescaled, it facilitates
		the comparison between projects, for instance, a researcher can
		calculate Moran's I in a city in China, with a sample size of
		n1 and area of interest a1. Another researcher runs a similar
		experiment in a city in Mexico with different sample size, n2,
		and an area of interest a2. Due to the differences between the
		conditions, it is not possible to compare Moran's I in a
		straightforward way. In this version of the package, the
		spatial autocorrelation Moran's I is calculated as proposed in
		Chen(2009) arXiv:1606.03658.
