		Algorithmic Framework for Representational Learning on Graphs //
		Given any graph, the 'node2vec' algorithm can learn continuous
		feature representations for the nodes, which can then be used
		for various downstream machine learning tasks.The techniques
		are detailed in the paper "node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning
		for Networks" by Aditya Grover, Jure Leskovec(2016),available
		at arXiv:1607.00653.
