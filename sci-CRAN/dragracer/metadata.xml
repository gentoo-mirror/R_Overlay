		Data Sets for RuPaul's Drag Race // These are data sets for the
		hit TV show, RuPaul's Drag Race. Data right now include
		episode-level data, contestant-level data, and episode-
		contestant-level data. This is a work in progress, and a love
		letter of a kind to RuPaul's Drag Race and the performers that
		have appeared on the show. This may not be the most productive
		use of my time, but I have tenure and what are you going to do
		about it? I think there is at least some value in this package
		if it allows the show's fandom to learn more about the R
		programming language around its contents.
