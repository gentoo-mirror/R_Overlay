		Exact Confidence Limits after a Sequential Trial // The user
		first provides design vectors n, a and b as well as null (p0)
		and alternative (p1) benchmark values for the probability of
		success. The key function "mv.plots.SM()" calculates mean
		values of exact upper and lower limits based on four different
		rank ordering methods. These plots form the basis of selecting
		a rank ordering. The function "inference()" calculates exact
		limits from a provided realisation and ordering choice. For
		more information, see "Exact confidence limits after a group
		sequential single arm binary trial" by Lloyd, C.J. (2020),
		Statistics in Medicine, Volume 38, 2389-2399,
