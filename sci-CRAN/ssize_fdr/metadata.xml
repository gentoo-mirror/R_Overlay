		Sample Size Calculations for Microarray Experiments // This
		package contains a set of functions that calculates appropriate
		sample sizes for one-sample t-tests, two-sample t-tests, and
		F-tests for microarray experiments based on desired power while
		controlling for false discovery rates. For all tests, the
		standard deviations (variances) among genes can be assumed
		fixed or random. This is also true for effect sizes among genes
		in one-sample and two sample experiments. Functions also output
		a chart of power versus sample size, a table of power at
		different sample sizes, and a table of critical test values at
		different sample sizes.
