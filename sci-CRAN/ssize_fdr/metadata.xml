		Sample Size Calculations for Microarray Experiments // Functions
		that calculate appropriate sample sizes for one-sample t-tests,
		two-sample t-tests, and F-tests for microarray experiments
		based on desired power while controlling for false discovery
		rates. For all tests, the standard deviations (variances) among
		genes can be assumed fixed or random.  This is also true for
		effect sizes among genes in one-sample and two sample
		experiments. Functions also output a chart of power versus
		sample size, a table of power at different sample sizes, and a
		table of critical test values at different sample sizes.
