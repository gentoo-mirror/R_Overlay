		Heatmaps for Multiple Network Data // Simplify the exploratory
		data analysis process for multiple network data sets with the
		help of hierarchical clustering and heatmaps. Multiple network
		data consists of multiple disjoint networks that share common
		graph, node and edge variables. Contains the tools necessary to
		convert this raw data into a single dynamic report, summarizing
		the relationships of the graph, node and structural
		characteristics of the networks.
