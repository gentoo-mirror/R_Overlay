		Tidy Messy Data // Tools to help to create tidy data, where each
		column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell
		contains a single value.  'tidyr' contains tools for changing
		the shape (pivoting) and hierarchy (nesting and 'unnesting') of
		a dataset, turning deeply nested lists into rectangular data
		frames ('rectangling'), and extracting values out of string
		columns. It also includes tools for working with missing values
		(both implicit and explicit).
