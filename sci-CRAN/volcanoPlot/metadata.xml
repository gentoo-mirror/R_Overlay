		Volcano Plot for Clinical Trial Adverse Events // Interactive
		adverse event (AE) volcano plot for monitoring clinical trial
		safety. This tool allows users to view the overall distribution
		of AEs in a clinical trial using standard (e.g. MedDRA
		preferred term) or custom (e.g. Gender) categories using a
		volcano plot similar to proposal by Zink et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1177/1740774513485311. This tool provides a stand-along
		shiny application and flexible shiny modules allowing this tool
		to be used as a part of more robust safety monitoring framework
		like the Shiny app from the 'safetyGraphics' R package.
