		Discriminating Well Surveyed Spatial Units from Exhaustive
		Biodiversity Databases // It uses species accumulation curves
		and diverse estimators to assess, at the same time, the levels
		of survey coverage in multiple geographic cells of a size

		geographical depiction of observed species richness, survey
		effort and completeness values including a background with
		administrative areas.
