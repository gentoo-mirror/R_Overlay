		Easy Manipulation of Out of Memory Data Sets // Hard drive data:
		Class of data allowing the easy importation/manipulation of out
		of memory data sets. The data sets are located on disk but look
		like in-memory, the syntax for manipulation is similar to
		'data.table'. Operations are performed "chunk-wise" behind the
		scene.
