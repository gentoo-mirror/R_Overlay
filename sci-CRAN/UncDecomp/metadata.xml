		Uncertainty Decomposition // If a procedure consists of several
		stages and there are several scenarios that can be selected for
		each stage, uncertainty of the procedure can be decomposed by
		stages or scenarios. cum_uncertainty() is used to decompose
		uncertainty based on the cumulative uncertainty.
		stage_uncertainty() and scenario_uncertainty() is used to
		decompose uncertainty based on the second order interaction
		ANOVA model. In stage_uncertainty() and scenario_uncertainty(),
		the uncertainty from interaction effect from two stages is
		distributed equally to each stage.
