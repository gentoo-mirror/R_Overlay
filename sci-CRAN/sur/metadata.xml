		Companion to "Statistics Using R: An Integrative Approach" //
		Access to the datasets and many of the functions used in
		"Statistics Using R: An Integrative Approach". These datasets
		include a subset of the National Education Longitudinal Study,
		the Framingham Heart Study, as well as several simulated
		datasets used in the examples throughout the textbook. The
		functions included in the package reproduce some of the
		functionality of 'Stata' that is not directly available in 'R'.
		The package also contains a tutorial on basic data frame
		management, including how to handle missing data.
