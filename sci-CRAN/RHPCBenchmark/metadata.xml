		Benchmarks for High-Performance Computing Environments //
		Microbenchmarks for determining the run time performance of
		aspects of the R programming environment and packages relevant
		to high-performance computation.  The benchmarks are divided
		into three categories: dense matrix linear algebra kernels,
		sparse matrix linear algebra kernels, and machine learning
		functionality.
