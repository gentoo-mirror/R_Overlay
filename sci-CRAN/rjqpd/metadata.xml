		The Johnson Quantile-Parameterised Distribution // Implementation
		of the Johnson Quantile-Parameterised Distribution in R. The
		Johnson Quantile-Parameterised Distribution (J-QPD) is a
		flexible distribution system that is parameterised by a
		symmetric percentile triplet of quantile values (typically the
		10th-50th-90th) along with known support bounds for the
		distribution. The J-QPD system was developed by Hadlock and
		Bickel (2017) doi:10.1287/deca.2016.0343. This package
		implements the density, quantile, CDF and random number
		generator functions.
