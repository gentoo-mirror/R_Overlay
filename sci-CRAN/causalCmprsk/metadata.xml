		Nonparametric and Cox-Based Estimation of Average Treatment
		Effects in Competing Risks // Estimation of average treatment
		effects (ATE) of point interventions on time-to-event outcomes
		with K competing risks (K can be 1). The method uses propensity
		scores and inverse probability weighting for emulation of
		baseline randomization, which is described in Charpignon et al.
