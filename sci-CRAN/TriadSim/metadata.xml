		Simulating Triad Genomewide Genotypes // Simulate genotypes for
		case-parent triads, case-control, and quantitative trait
		samples with realistic linkage diequilibrium structure and
		allele frequency distribution. For studies of epistasis one can
		simulate models that involve specific SNPs at specific sets of
		loci, which we will refer to as "pathways". TriadSim generates
		genotype data by resampling triad genotypes from existing data.
		The details of the method is described in the manuscript under
		preparation "Simulating Autosomal Genotypes with Realistic
		Linkage Disequilibrium and a Spiked in Genetic Effect" Shi, M.,
		Umbach, D.M., Wise A.S., Weinberg, C.R.
