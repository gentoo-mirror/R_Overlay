		Function Mocking for Unit Testing // With the deprecation of
		mocking capabilities shipped with 'testthat' as of 'edition 3'
		it is left to third-party packages to replace this
		functionality, which in some test-scenarios is essential in
		order to run unit tests in limited environments (such as no
		Internet connection). Mocking in this setting means temporarily
		substituting a function with a stub that acts in some sense
		like the original function (for example by serving a HTTP
		response that has been cached as a file). The only exported
		function 'with_mock()' is modeled after the eponymous
		'testthat' function with the intention of providing a drop-in
		replacement.
