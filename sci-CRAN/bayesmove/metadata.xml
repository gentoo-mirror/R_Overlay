		Non-Parametric Bayesian Analyses of Animal Movement // Methods
		for assessing animal movement from telemetry and biologging
		data using non-parametric Bayesian methods. This includes
		features for pre- processing and analysis of data, as well as
		the visualization of results from the models. This framework
		does not rely on standard parametric density functions, which
		provides flexibility during model fitting. Further details
		regarding part of this framework can be found in Cullen et al.
