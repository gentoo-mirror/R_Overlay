		Genetic Algorithms // Flexible general-purpose toolbox
		implementing genetic algorithms (GAs) for stochastic
		optimisation. Binary, real-valued, and permutation
		representations are available to optimize a fitness function,
		i.e. a function provided by users depending on their objective
		function. Several genetic operators are available and can be
		combined to explore the best settings for the current task.
		Furthermore, users can define new genetic operators and easily
		evaluate their performances. Local search using general-purpose
		optimisation algorithms can be applied stochastically to
		exploit interesting regions. GAs can be run sequentially or in
		parallel, using an explicit master-slave parallelisation or a
		coarse-grain islands approach.
