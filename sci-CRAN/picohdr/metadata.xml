		Read, Write and Manipulate High Dynamic Range Images // High
		Dynamic Range (HDR) images support a large range in luminosity
		between the lightest and darkest regions of an image.  To
		capture this range, data in HDR images is often stored as
		floating point numbers and in formats that capture more data
		and channels than standard image types.  This package supports
		reading and writing two types of HDR images; PFM (Portable
		Float Map) and OpenEXR images. HDR images can be converted to
		lower dynamic ranges (for viewing) using tone-mapping.  A
		number of tone-mapping algorithms are included which are based
		on Reinhard (2002) "Photographic tone reproduction for digital
		images" doi:10.1145/566654.566575.
