		Clinical Trial Calculation Based on BCHM Design // Users can
		estimate the treatment effect for multiple subgroups basket
		trials based on the Bayesian Cluster Hierarchical Model (BCHM).
		In this model, a Bayesian non-parametric method is applied to
		dynamically calculate the number of clusters by conducting the
		multiple cluster classification based on subgroup outcomes.
		Hierarchical model is used to compute the posterior probability
		of treatment effect with the borrowing strength determined by
		the Bayesian non-parametric clustering and the similarities
		between subgroups. To use this package, 'JAGS' software and
		'rjags' package are required, and users need to pre-install
		them.
