		Match Triples Consisting of Two Controls and a Treated Unit or
		Vice Versa // Attain excellent covariate balance by matching
		two treated units and one control unit or vice versa within
		strata. Using such triples, as opposed to also allowing pairs
		of treated and control units, allows easier interpretation of
		the two possible weights of observations and better
		insensitivity to unmeasured bias in the test statistic. Using
		triples instead of matching in a fixed 1:2 or 2:1 ratio allows
		for the match to be feasible in more situations. The 'rrelaxiv'
		package, which provides an alternative solver for the
		underlying network flow problems, carries an academic license
		and is not available on CRAN, but may be downloaded from
		'GitHub' at https://github.com/josherrickson/rrelaxiv/. The
		'Gurobi' commercial optimization software is required to use
		the two functions [infsentrip()] and [triplesIP()]. These
		functions are not essential to the main purpose of this
		package. A free academic license can be obtained at
		https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/.
		The 'gurobi' R package can then be installed following the
		instructions at https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman
		/ins_the_r_package.html.
