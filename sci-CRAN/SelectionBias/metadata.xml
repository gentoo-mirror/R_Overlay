		Calculates Bounds for the Selection Bias for Binary Treatment and
		Outcome Variables // Computes bounds and sensitivity parameters
		as part of sensitivity analysis for selection bias. Different
		bounds are provided: the SV (Smith and VanderWeele), AF
		(assumption-free) bound, GAF (generalized AF), and CAF
		(counterfactual AF) bounds. The calculation of the sensitivity
		parameters for the SV and GAF bounds assume an additional
		dependence structure in form of a generalized M-structure. The
		bounds can be calculated for any structure as long as the
		necessary assumptions hold. See Smith and VanderWeele (2019)
