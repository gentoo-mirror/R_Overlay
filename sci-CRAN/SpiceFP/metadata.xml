		Sparse Method to Identify Joint Effects of Functional Predictors
		// A set of functions allowing to implement the 'SpiceFP'
		approach which is iterative. It involves transformation of
		functional predictors into several candidate explanatory
		matrices (based on contingency tables), to which relative edge
		matrices with contiguity constraints are associated.
		Generalized Fused Lasso regression are performed in order to
		identify the best candidate matrix, the best class intervals
		and related coefficients at each iteration. The approach is
		stopped when the maximal number of iterations is reached or
		when retained coefficients are zeros. Supplementary functions
		allow to get coefficients of any candidate matrix or mean of
		coefficients of many candidates.
