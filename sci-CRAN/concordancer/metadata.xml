		An 'Rcpp' Implementation of Lin's Concordance Correlation
		Coefficient (CCC) // Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient
		(CCC) is a statistic which measures the degree of agreement
		between two variables. The CCC is useful for assessing (i) the
		measurement agreement between two variables (typically outputs
		between two devices); (ii) the reproducibility between two
		measurements obtained from the same device; and (iii) inter-
		rater reliability. The 'concordancer' package provides a 'C++'
		implementation of Lin's CCC via 'Rcpp'. In so doing, the ccc()
		function contained herein is a much faster implementation than
		those contained in other R packages. For more details on Lin's
		CCC, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_corre
		lation_coefficient.
