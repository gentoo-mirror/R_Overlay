		Composite Index Builder  Analytics 'shiny' App // Provides an
		interactive 'shiny' web application for constructing,
		analyzing, and visualizing composite indices from
		multidimensional datasets. Users can upload or select indicator
		data, group variables into logical categories, apply
		normalization and weighting methods (such as 'equal' or
		'custom' schemes), and compute aggregate composite indices. The
		'shiny' interface includes tools for exploring results through
		tables, plots, and data exports, making it useful for
		researchers, policymakers, and analysts interested in index-
		based evaluations.
