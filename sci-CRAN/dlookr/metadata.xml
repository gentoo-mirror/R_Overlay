		Tools for Data Diagnosis, Exploration, Transformation // A
		collection of tools that support data diagnosis, exploration,
		and transformation. Data diagnostics provides information and
		visualization of missing values, outliers, and unique and
		negative values to help you understand the distribution and
		quality of your data. Data exploration provides information and
		visualization of the descriptive statistics of univariate
		variables, normality tests and outliers, correlation of two
		variables, and the relationship between the target variable and
		predictor. Data transformation supports binning for
		categorizing continuous variables, imputes missing values and
		outliers, and resolves skewness. And it creates automated
		reports that support these three tasks.
