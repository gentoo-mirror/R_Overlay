		Weighted Generalised Covariance Measure Conditional Independence
		Test // A conditional independence test that can be applied
		both to univariate and multivariate random variables. The test
		is based on a weighted form of the sample covariance of the
		residuals after a nonlinear regression on the conditioning
		variables. Details are described in Scheidegger, Hoerrmann and
		Buehlmann (2021) "The Weighted Generalised Covariance Measure"
		arXiv:2111.04361. The test is a generalisation of the
		Generalised Covariance Measure (GCM) implemented in the R
		package 'GeneralisedCovarianceMeasure' by Jonas Peters and
		Rajen D. Shah based on Shah and Peters (2020) "The Hardness of
		Conditional Independence Testing and the Generalised Covariance
		Measure" arXiv:1804.07203.
