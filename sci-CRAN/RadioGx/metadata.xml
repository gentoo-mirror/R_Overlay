		Analysis of Large-Scale Radio-Genomic Data // Computational tool
		box for radio-genomic analysis which integrates radio-response
		data, radio-biological modelling and comprehensive cell line
		annotations for hundreds of cancer cell lines. The 'RadioSet'
		class enables creation and manipulation of standardized
		datasets including information about cancer cells lines, radio-
		response assays and dose-response indicators. Included methods
		allow fitting and plotting dose-response data using established
		radio-biological models along with quality control to validate
		results. Additional functions related to fitting and plotting
		dose response curves, quantifying statistical correlation and
		calculating area under the curve (AUC) or survival fraction
		(SF) are included. For more details please see the included
		documentation, references, as well as: Manem, V. et al (2018)
		doi:10.1101/449793.
