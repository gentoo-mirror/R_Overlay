		'KorAP' Web Service Client Package // A client package that makes
		the 'KorAP' web service API accessible from R. The corpus
		analysis platform 'KorAP' has been developed as a scientific
		tool to make potentially large, stratified and multiply
		annotated corpora, such as the 'German Reference Corpus DeReKo'
		or the 'Corpus of the Contemporary Romanian Language CoRoLa',
		accessible for linguists to let them verify hypotheses and to
		find interesting patterns in real language use. The
		'RKorAPClient' package provides access to 'KorAP' and the
		corpora behind it for user-created R code, as a programmatic
		alternative to the 'KorAP' web user-interface. You can learn
		more about 'KorAP' and use it directly on 'DeReKo' at
		https://korap.ids-mannheim.de/.
