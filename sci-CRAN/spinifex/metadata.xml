		Manual Tours, Manual Control of Dynamic Projections of Numeric
		Multivariate Data // Generates the path for manual tours
		['Cook'  'Buja' (1997) doi:10.2307/1390747]. Tours are
		generally available in the 'tourr' package ['Wickham' 'et'
		'al.' (2011) doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i02]. The grand tour is an
		algorithm that shows all possible projections given sufficient
		time. Guided uses projection pursuit to steer the tour towards
		interesting projections. The 'spinifex' package implements
		manual control, where the contribution of a selected variable
		can be adjusted between -1 to 1, to examine the sensitivity of
		structure in the data to that variable. The result is an
		animation where the variable is toured into and out of the
		projection completely, which can be rendered using the
		'gganimate' and 'plotly' packages.
