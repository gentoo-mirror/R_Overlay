		Manual Tours, Manual Control of Dynamic Projections of Numeric
		Multivariate Data // Data visualization tours animates linear
		projection of multivariate data as its basis (ie. orientation)
		changes. The 'spinifex' packages generates paths for manual
		tours by manipulating the contribution of a single variable at
		a time ['Cook'  'Buja' (1997) doi:10.2307/1390747]. Other types
		of tours, such as grand (random walk) and guided (optimizing
		some objective function) are available in the 'tourr' package
		['Wickham' 'et' 'al.' (2011) doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i02].
		'spinifex' builds on 'tourr' and can render tours with
		'gganimate' and 'plotly' graphics, and allows for exporting as
		an .html widget and as an .gif, respectively. This work is
		fully discussed at ['Spyrison'  'Cook' (2020)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2020-027.
