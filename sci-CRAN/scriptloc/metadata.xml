		Get the Location of the R Script that is Being Sourced/Executed
		// Provides functions to retrieve the location of R scripts
		loaded through the source() function or run from the command
		line using the Rscript command. This functionality is analogous
		to the Bash shell's ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}. Users can first set the
		project root's path relative to the script path and then all
		subsequent paths relative to the root. This system ensures that
		all paths lead to the same location regardless of where any
		script is executed/loaded from without resorting to the use of
		setwd() at the top of the scripts.
