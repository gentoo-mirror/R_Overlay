		Global Sensitivity Analysis of Model Outputs and Importance
		Measures // A collection of functions for sensitivity analysis
		of model outputs (factor screening, global sensitivity analysis
		and robustness analysis), for variable importance measures of
		data, as well as for interpretability of machine learning
		models. Most of the functions have to be applied on scalar
		output, but several functions support multi-dimensional
		outputs.
