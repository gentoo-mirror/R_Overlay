		PSO Based Weighted Ensemble Algorithm for Volatility Modelling //
		Price volatility refers to the degree of variation in series
		over a certain period of time. This volatility is especially
		noticeable in agricultural commodities, adding uncertainty for
		farmers, traders, and others in the agricultural supply chain.
		Commonly and popularly used four volatility models viz, GARCH,
		Glosten Jagannatan Runkle-GARCH (GJR-GARCH) model,
		exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model and
		Multiplicative Error Model (MEM) are selected and implemented.
		PWAVE, weighted ensemble model based on particle swarm
		optimization (PSO) is proposed to combine the forecast obtained
		from all the candidate models. This package has been developed
		using algorithm of Paul et al. doi:10.1007/s40009-023-01218-x
		and Yeasin and Paul (2024) doi:10.1007/s11227-023-05542-3.
