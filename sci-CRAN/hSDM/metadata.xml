		Hierarchical Bayesian Species Distribution Models // User-
		friendly and fast set of functions for estimating parameters of
		hierarchical Bayesian species distribution models (Latimer and
		others 2006 doi:10.1890/04-0609). Such models allow
		interpreting the observations (occurrence and abundance of a
		species) as a result of several hierarchical processes
		including ecological processes (habitat suitability, spatial
		dependence and anthropogenic disturbance) and observation
		processes (species detectability). Hierarchical species
		distribution models are essential for accurately characterizing
		the environmental response of species, predicting their
		probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty in the
		model results.
