		Adaptive Bioequivalence Design for In-Vitro Permeation Tests //
		Contains functions carrying out adaptive procedures using mixed
		scaling approach to establish bioequivalence for in-vitro
		permeation test (IVPT) data. Currently, the package provides
		procedures based on parallel replicate design and balanced
		data, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
		"Draft Guidance on Acyclovir" https:www.accessdata.fda.gov/drug
		satfda_docs/psg/Acyclovir_topical cream_RLD 21478_RV12-16.pdf.
		Potvin et al. (2008) doi:10.1002/pst.294 provides the basis for
		our adaptive design (see Method B). This package reflects the
		views of the authors and should not be construed to represent
		the views or policies of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
