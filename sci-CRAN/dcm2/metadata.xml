		Calculating the M2 Model Fit Statistic for Diagnostic
		Classification Models // A collection of functions for
		calculating the M2 model fit statistic for diagnostic
		classification models as described by Liu et al. (2016)
		DOI:10.3102/1076998615621293. These functions provide multiple
		sources of information for model fit according to the M2
		statistic, including the M2 statistic, the *p* value for that
		M2 statistic, and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
		based on the M2 statistic.
