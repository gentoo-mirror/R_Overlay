		Common Forms for Complex Hierarchical and Relational Data
		Structures // Generate common data forms for complex data
		suitable for conversions and transmission by decomposition as
		paths or primitives. Paths are sequentially-linked records,
		primitives are basic atomic elements and both can model many
		forms and be grouped into hierarchical structures.  The
		universal models 'SC0' (structural) and 'SC' (labelled,
		relational) are composed of edges and can represent any
		hierarchical form. Specialist models 'PATH', 'ARC' and 'TRI'
		provide the most common intermediate forms used for converting
		from one form to another. The methods are inspired by the
		simplicial complex
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex and provide
		intermediate forms that relate spatial data structures to this
		mathematical construct.
