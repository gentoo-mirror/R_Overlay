		Hot-Spot Analysis with Simple Features // Identify and understand
		clusters of points (typically representing the locations of
		places or events) stored in simple-features (SF) objects. This
		is useful for analysing, for example, hot-spots of crime
		events. The package emphasises producing results from point SF
		data in a single step using reasonable default values for all
		other arguments, to aid rapid data analysis by users who are
		starting out. Functions available include kernel density
		estimation (for details, see Yip (2020)
		doi:10.22224/gistbok/2020.1.12), analysis of spatial
		association (Getis and Ord (1992)
		doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) and hot-spot
		classification (Chainey (2020) ISBN:158948584X).
