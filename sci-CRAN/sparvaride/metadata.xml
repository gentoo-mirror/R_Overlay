		Variance Identification in Sparse Factor Analysis // This is an
		implementation of the algorithm described in Section 3 of
		Hosszejni and Frhwirth-Schnatter (2022)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.00671. The algorithm is used to verify
		that the counting rule CR(r,1) holds for the sparsity pattern
		of the transpose of a factor loading matrix. As detailed in
		Section 2 of the same paper, if CR(r,1) holds, then the
		idiosyncratic variances are generically identified. If CR(r,1)
		does not hold, then we do not know whether the idiosyncratic
		variances are identified or not.
