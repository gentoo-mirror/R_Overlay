		Represent Ordered Lists and Pairs as Strings // Interconverts
		between ordered lists and compact string notation. Useful for
		capturing code lists, and pair-wise codes and decodes, for text
		storage. Analogous to factor levels and labels. Generics
		encode() and decode() perform interconversion, while codes()
		and decodes() extract components of an encoding. The function
		encoded() checks whether something is interpretable as an
		encoding.
