		Genotyping of triploid individuals from luminescence data
		(marker probeset A and B). Works also for diploids. Two main
		functions: Run_Clustering() that regroups individuals with a
		same genotype based on proximity and Run_Genotyping() that
		assigns a genotype to each cluster. For Shiny interface use:
		launch_GenoShiny().
