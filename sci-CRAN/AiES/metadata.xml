		Axon Integrity Evaluation System for Microscopy Images //
		Provides tools for the quantitative analysis of axon integrity
		in microscopy images. It implements image pre-processing,
		adaptive thresholding, feature extraction, and support vector
		machine-based classification to compute indices such as the
		Axon Integrity Index (AII) and Degeneration Index (DI). The
		package is designed for reproducible and automated analysis in
		neuroscience research.
