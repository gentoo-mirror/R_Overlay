		A Set-Based Association Test using GWAS Summary Statistics // The
		goal of 'snpsettest' is to provide simple tools that perform
		set-based association tests (e.g., gene-based association
		tests) using GWAS (genome-wide association study) summary
		statistics. A set-based association test in this package is
		based on the statistical model described in VEGAS (versatile
		gene-based association study), which combines the effects of a
		set of SNPs accounting for linkage disequilibrium between
		markers. This package uses a different approach from the
		original VEGAS implementation to compute set-level p values
		more efficiently, as described in
		https://github.com/HimesGroup/snpsettest/wiki/Statistical-test-
		in-snpsettest.
