		Biochemically Intuitive Generalized Loewe Model // Response
		surface methods for drug synergy analysis. Available methods
		include generalized and classical Loewe formulations as well as
		Highest Single Agent methodology. Response surfaces can be
		plotted in an interactive 3-D plot and formal statistical tests
		for presence of synergistic effects are available. Implemented
		methods and tests are described in the article "BIGL:
		Biochemically Intuitive Generalized Loewe null model for
		prediction of the expected combined effect compatible with
		partial agonism and antagonism" by Koen Van der Borght,
		Annelies Tourny, Rytis Bagdziunas, Olivier Thas, Maxim Nazarov,
