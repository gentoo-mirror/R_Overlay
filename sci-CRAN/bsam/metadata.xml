		Bayesian State-Space Models for Animal Movement // Tools to fit
		Bayesian state-space models to animal tracking data. Models are
		provided for location filtering, location filtering and
		behavioural state estimation, and their hierarchical versions.
		The models are primarily intended for fitting to ARGOS
		satellite tracking data but options exist to fit to other
		tracking data types. For Global Positioning System data,
		consider the 'moveHMM' package. Simplified Markov Chain Monte
		Carlo convergence diagnostic plotting is provided but users are
		encouraged to explore tools available in packages such as
		'coda' and 'boa'.
