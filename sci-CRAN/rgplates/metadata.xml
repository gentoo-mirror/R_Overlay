		R Interface for the GPlates Web Service and Desktop Application
		// Query functions to the GPlates https://www.gplates.org/
		Desktop Application and the GPlates Web Service
		https://gws.gplates.org/ allow users to reconstruct past
		positions of geographic entities based on user-selected
		rotation models without leaving the R running environment. The
		online method (GPlates Web Service) makes the rotation of
		static plates, coastlines, and a low number of geographic
		coordinates available using nothing but an internet connection.
		The offline method requires an external installation of the
		GPlates Desktop Application, but allows the efficient batch
		rotation of thousands of coordinates, Simple Features (sf) and
		Spatial (sp) objects with custom reconstruction trees and
		partitioning polygons. Examples of such plate tectonic models
		are accessible via the chronosphere-portal
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=chronosphere. This R
		extension is developed under the umbrella of the DFG (Deutsche
		Forschungsgemeinschaft) Research Unit TERSANE2 (For 2332,
		TEmperature Related Stressors in ANcient Extinctions).
