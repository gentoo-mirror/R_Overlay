		Fast, Dependency-Free Geodesic Distance Calculations //
		Dependency-free, ultra fast calculation of geodesic distances.
		Includes the reference nanometre-accuracy geodesic distances of
		Karney (2013) doi:10.1007/s00190-012-0578-z, as used by the
		'sf' package, as well as Haversine and Vincenty distances.
		Default distance measure is the "Mapbox cheap ruler" which is
		generally more accurate than Haversine or Vincenty for
		distances out to a few hundred kilometres, and is considerably
		faster. The main function accepts one or two inputs in almost
		any generic rectangular form, and returns either matrices of
		pairwise distances, or vectors of sequential distances.
