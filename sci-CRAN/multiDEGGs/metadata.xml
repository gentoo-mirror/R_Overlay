		Multi-Omic Differentially Expressed Gene-Gene Pairs // Performs
		multi-omic differential network analysis by revealing
		differential interactions between molecular entities (genes,
		proteins, transcription factors, or other biomolecules) across
		the omic datasets provided. For each omic dataset, a
		differential network is constructed where links represent
		statistically significant differential interactions between
		entities. These networks are then integrated into a
		comprehensive visualization using distinct colors to
		distinguish interactions from different omic layers. This
		unified display allows interactive exploration of cross-omic
		patterns, such as differential interactions present at both
		transcript and protein levels. For each link, users can access
		differential statistical significance metrics (p values or
		adjusted p values, calculated via robust or traditional linear
		regression with interaction term) and differential regression
		plots. The methods implemented in this package are described in
		Sciacca et al. (2023) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btad192.
