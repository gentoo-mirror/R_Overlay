		Stochastic Collision Risk Model // Collision Risk Models for
		avian fauna (seabird and migratory birds) at offshore wind
		farms. The base deterministic model is derived from Band (2012)
		https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/using-collision-risk-
		model-assess-bird-collision-risks-offshore-wind-farms. This was
		further expanded on by Masden (2015) doi:10.7489/1659-1 and
		code used here is heavily derived from this work with input
		from Dr A. Cook at the British Trust for Ornithology. These
		collision risk models are useful for marine ornithologists who
		are working in the offshore wind industry, particularly in UK
		waters. However, many of the species included in the stochastic
		collision risk models can also be found in the North Atlantic
		in the United States and Canada, and could be applied there.
