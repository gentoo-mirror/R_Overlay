		Stochastic Collision Risk Model // Collision Risk Models for
		avian fauna (seabird and migratory birds) at offshore wind
		farms. The base deterministic model is derived from Band (2012)
		https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/using-collision-risk-
		model-assess-bird-collision-risks-offshore-wind-farms. This was
		further expanded on by Masden (2015) doi:10.7489/1659-1 and
		code used here is heavily derived from this work with input
		from Dr A. Cook at the British Trust for Ornithology.
