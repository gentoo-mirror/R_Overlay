		Visualisation and Verification of Health Economic Decision Models
		// Designed to help health economic modellers when building and
		reviewing models. The visualisation functions allow users to
		more easily review the network of functions in a project, and
		get lay summaries of them. The asserts included are intended to
		check for common errors, thereby freeing up time for modellers
		to focus on tests specific to the individual model in
		development or review. For more details see Smith and
		colleagues (2024)doi:10.12688/wellcomeopenres.23180.1.
