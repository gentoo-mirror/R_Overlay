		Delta Measurement of Agreement for Nominal Data // Analysis of
		agreement for nominal data between two raters using the Delta
		model. This model is proposed as an alternative to the
		widespread measure Cohen kappa coefficient, which performs
		poorly when the marginal distributions are very asymmetric
		(Martin-Andres and Femia-Marzo (2004),
		doi:10.1348/000711004849268; Martin-Andres and Femia-Marzo
		(2008) doi:10.1080/03610920701669884). The package also
		contains a function to perform a massive analysis of multiple
		raters against a gold standard. A shiny app is also provided to
		obtain the measures of nominal agreement between two raters.
