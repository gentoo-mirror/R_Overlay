		A Collection of Functions to Experiment Dice Rolls // A
		collection of functions to simulate dice rolls and the like. In
		particular, experiments and exercises can be performed looking
		at combinations and permutations of values in dice rolls and
		coin flips, together with the corresponding frequencies of
		occurrences. When applying each function, the user has to input
		the number of times (rolls, flips) to toss the dice. Needless
		to say, the more the tosses, the more the frequencies
		approximate the actual probabilities. Moreover, the package
		provides functions to generate non-transitive sets of dice
		(like Efron's) and to check whether a given set of dice is non-
		transitive with given probability.
