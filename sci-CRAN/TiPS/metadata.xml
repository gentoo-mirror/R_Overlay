		Trajectories and Phylogenies Simulator // Generates stochastic
		time series and genealogies associated with a population
		dynamics model. Times series are simulated using the Gillespie
		exact and approximate algorithms and a new algorithm we
		introduce that uses both approaches to optimize the time
		execution of the simulations. Genealogies are simulated from a
		trajectory using a backwards-in-time based approach. Methods
		are described in Danesh G et al (2020)
