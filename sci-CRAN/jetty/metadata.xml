		Execute R in a 'Docker' Context // The goal of 'jetty' is to
		execute R functions and code snippets in an isolated R
		subprocess within a 'Docker' container and return the evaluated
		results to the local R session. 'jetty' can install necessary
		packages at runtime and seamlessly propagates errors and
		outputs from the 'Docker' subprocess back to the main session.
		'jetty' is primarily designed for sandboxed testing and quick
		execution of example code.
