		Nonparametric Estimation and Inference Procedures using
		Partitioning-Based Least Squares Regression // Tools for
		statistical analysis using partitioning-based least squares
		regression as described in Cattaneo, Farrell and Feng (2019a,
		arXiv:1804.04916) and Cattaneo, Farrell and Feng (2019b,
		arXiv:1906.00202): lsprobust() for nonparametric point
		estimation of regression functions and their derivatives and
		for robust bias-corrected (pointwise and uniform) inference;
		lspkselect() for data-driven selection of the IMSE-optimal
		number of knots; lsprobust.plot() for regression plots with
		robust confidence intervals and confidence bands; lsplincom()
		for estimation and inference for linear combinations of
		regression functions from different groups.
