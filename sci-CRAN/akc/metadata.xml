		Automatic Knowledge Classification // A tidy framework for
		automatic knowledge classification and visualization.
		Currently, the core functionality of the framework is mainly
		supported by modularity-based clustering (community detection)
		in keyword co-occurrence network, and focuses on co-word
		analysis of bibliometric research. However, the designed
		functions in 'akc' are general, and could be extended to solve
		other tasks in text mining as well.
