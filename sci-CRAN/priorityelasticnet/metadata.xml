		Comprehensive Analysis of Multi-Omics Data Using an Offset-Based
		Method // Priority-ElasticNet extends the Priority-LASSO method
		(Klau et al. (2018) doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2344-6) by
		incorporating the ElasticNet penalty, allowing for both L1 and
		L2 regularization. This approach fits successive ElasticNet
		models for several blocks of (omics) data with different
		priorities, using the predicted values from each block as an
		offset for the subsequent block. It also offers robust options
		to handle block-wise missingness in multi-omics data, improving
		the flexibility and applicability of the model in the presence
		of incomplete datasets.
