		Missing not at Random Imputation Models for Multiple Imputation
		by Chained Equation // Provides imputation models and functions
		for binary or continuous Missing Not At Random (MNAR) outcomes
		through the use of the 'mice' package. The
		mice.impute.hecknorm() function provides imputation model for
		continuous outcome based on Heckman's model also named sample
		selection model as described in Galimard et al (2018) and
		Galimard et al (2016) doi:10.1002/sim.6902. The
		mice.impute.heckprob() function provides imputation model for
		binary outcome based on bivariate probit model as described in
		Galimard et al (2018).
