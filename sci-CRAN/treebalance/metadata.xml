		Computation of Tree (Im)Balance Indices // The aim of the 'R'
		package 'treebalance' is to provide functions for the
		computation of a large variety of (im)balance indices for
		rooted trees. The package accompanies the manuscript ''Tree
		balance indices: a comprehensive survey'' by M. Fischer, L.
		Herbst, S. Kersting, L. Kuehn and K. Wicke (2021)
		arXiv:2109.12281, which gives a precise definition for the
		terms 'balance index' and 'imbalance index' (Section 3) and
		provides an overview of the terminology in this manual (Section
		2). For further information on (im)balance indices, see also
		Fischer et al. (2021) https://treebalance.wordpress.com.
		Considering both established and new (im)balance indices,
		'treebalance' provides (among others) functions for calculating
		the following 18 established indices: the average leaf depth,
		the B1 and B2 index, the Colijn-Plazzotta rank, the normal,
		corrected, quadratic and equal weights Colless index, the
		family of Colless-like indices, the family of I-based indices,
		the Rogers J index, the Furnas rank, the rooted quartet index,
		the s-shape statistic, the Sackin index, the symmetry nodes
		index, the total cophenetic index and the variance of leaf
		depths. Additionally, we include 5 tree shape statistics that
		satisfy the definition of an (im)balance index but have not
		been thoroughly analyzed in terms of tree balance in the
		literature yet. These are: the maximum width, the maximum
		difference in widths, the maximal depth, the stairs1 and the
		stairs2 index. As input, most functions of 'treebalance'
		require a rooted (phylogenetic) tree in 'phylo' format (as
		introduced in 'ape' 1.9 in November 2006). 'phylo' is used to
		store (phylogenetic) trees with no vertices of out-degree one.
		For further information on the format we kindly refer the
		reader to E. Paradis (2012) http://ape-
		package.ird.fr/misc/FormatTreeR_24Oct2012.pdf.
