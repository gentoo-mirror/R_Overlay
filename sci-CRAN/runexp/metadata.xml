		Softball Run Expectancy using Markov Chains and Simulation //
		Implements two methods of estimating runs scored in a softball
		scenario: (1) theoretical expectation using discrete Markov
		chains and (2) empirical distribution using multinomial random
		simulation.  Scores are based on player-specific input
		probabilities (out, single, double, triple, walk, and homerun).
		Optional inputs include probability of attempting a steal,
		probability of succeeding in an attempted steal, and an
		indicator of whether a player is "fast" (e.g. the player could
		stretch home).  These probabilities may be calculated from
		common player statistics that are publicly available on team's
		webpages. Scores are evaluated based on a nine-player lineup
		and may be used to compare lineups, evaluate base scenarios,
		and compare the offensive potential of individual players.
		Manuscript forthcoming.  See Bukiet  Harold (1997)
		doi:10.1287/opre.45.1.14 for implementation of discrete Markov
		chains.
