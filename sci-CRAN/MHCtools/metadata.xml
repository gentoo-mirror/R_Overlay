		Analysis of MHC Data in Non-Model Species // Ten tools for
		analysis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) data in non-
		model species. The functions are tailored for amplicon data
		sets that have been filtered using the 'dada2' method (for more
		information visit https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2), but even
		other data sets can be analysed, if the data tables are
		formatted according to the description in each function. The
		ReplMatch() function matches replicates in data sets in order
		to evaluate genotyping success. The GetReplTable() and
		GetReplStats() functions perform such an evaluation. The
		HpltFind() function infers putative haplotypes from families in
		the data set. The GetHpltTable() and GetHpltStats() functions
		evaluate the accuracy of the haplotype inference. The PapaDiv()
		function compares parent pairs in the data set and calculate
		their joint MHC diversity, taking into account sequence
		variants that occur in both parents. The MeanPdist() function
		calculates the mean p-distance from pairwise comparisons
		sequences in each sample in a data set. The function includes
		the option to specify which codons to compare. The CreateFas()
		function creates a fasta file with all the sequences in the
		data set. The CreateSamplesFas() function creates a fasta file
		for each sample in the data set.
