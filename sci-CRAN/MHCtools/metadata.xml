		Analysis of MHC Data in Non-Model Species // Twelve tools for
		bioinformatical processing and analysis of major
		histocompatibility complex (MHC) data. The functions are
		tailored for amplicon data sets that have been filtered using
		the 'dada2' method (for more information on 'dada2', visit
		https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ ), but even other types of
		data sets can be analyzed. The DistCalc() function calculates
		Grantham, Sandberg, or p-distances from pairwise comparisons of
		all sequences in a data set, and mean distances of all pairwise
		comparisons within each sample in a data set. The function
		additionally outputs five tables with physico-chemical
		z-descriptor values (based on Sandberg et al. 1998) for each
		amino acid position in all sequences in the data set. These
		tables may be useful for further downstream analyses, such as
		estimation of MHC supertypes. The BootKmeans() function is a
		wrapper for the kmeans() function of the 'stats' package, which
		allows for bootstrapping. Bootstrapping k-estimates may be
		desirable in data sets, where e.g. BIC- vs. k-values do not
		produce clear inflection points ("elbows"). BootKmeans()
		performs multiple runs of kmeans() and estimates optimal
		k-values based on a user-defined threshold of BIC reduction.
		The method is an automated and bootstrapped version of visually
		inspecting elbow plots of BIC- vs. k-values. The ClusterMatch()
		function is a tool for evaluating whether different k-means()
		clustering models identify similar clusters, and summarize
		bootstrap model stats as means for different estimated values
		of k. It is designed to take files produced by the BootKmeans()
		function as input, but other data can be analysed if the
		descriptions of the required data formats are observed
		carefully. The HpltFind() function infers putative haplotypes
		from families in the data set. The GetHpltTable() and
		GetHpltStats() functions evaluate the accuracy of the haplotype
		inference. The PapaDiv() function compares parent pairs in the
		data set and calculate their joint MHC diversity, taking into
		account sequence variants that occur in both parents. The
		ReplMatch() function matches replicates in data sets in order
		to evaluate genotyping success. The GetReplTable() and
		GetReplStats() functions perform such an evaluation. The
		CreateFas() function creates a fasta file with all the
		sequences in the data set. The CreateSamplesFas() function
		creates individual fasta files for each sample in the data set.
