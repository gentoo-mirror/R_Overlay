		Analysis of Differential Calorimetry Scans // It includes
		functions for applying methodologies utilized for single-
		process kinetic analysis of solid-state processes were recently
		summarized and described in the Recommendation of ICTAC Kinetic
		Committee. These methods work with the basic kinetic equation.
		The Methodologies included refers to  Avrami, Friedman,
		Kissinger, Ozawa, OFM, Mo, Starink, isoconversional methodology
		(Vyazovkin) according to ICATAC Kinetics Committee
		recommendations as reported in Vyazovkin S, Chrissafis K, Di
		Lorenzo ML, et al. ICTAC Kinetics Committee recommendations for
		collecting experimental thermal analysis data for kinetic
		computations. Thermochim Acta. 2014;590:1-23.
