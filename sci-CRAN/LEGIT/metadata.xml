		Latent Environmental  Genetic InTeraction (LEGIT) Model //
		Constructs genotype x environment interaction (GxE) models
		where G is a weighted sum of genetic variants (genetic score)
		and E is a weighted sum of environments (environmental score)
		using the alternating optimization algorithm by Jolicoeur-
		Martineau et al. (2017) arXiv:1703.08111. This approach has
		greatly enhanced predictive power over traditional GxE models
		which include only a single genetic variant and a single
		environmental exposure. Although this approach was originally
		made for GxE modelling, it is flexible and does not require the
		use of genetic and environmental variables. It can also handle
		more than 2 latent variables (rather than just G and E) and
		3-way interactions or more. The LEGIT model produces highly
		interpretable results and is very parameter-efficient thus it
		can even be used with small sample sizes (n  250).
