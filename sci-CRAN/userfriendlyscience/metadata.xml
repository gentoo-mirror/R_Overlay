		Quantitative Analysis Made Accessible // Contains a number of
		functions that serve two goals.  First, to make R more
		accessible to people migrating from SPSS by adding a number of
		functions that behave roughly like their SPSS equivalents.
		Second, to make a number of slightly more advanced functions
		more user friendly to relatively novice users. The package also
		conveniently houses a number of additional functions that are
		intended to increase the quality of methodology and statistics
		in psychology, not by offering technical solutions, but by
		shifting perspectives, for example towards reasoning based on
		sampling distributions as opposed to on point estimates.
