		Shared, Joint (Generalized) Frailty Models; Surrogate Endpoints
		// The following several classes of frailty models using a
		penalized likelihood estimation on the hazard function but also
		a parametric estimation can be fit using this R package: 1) A
		shared frailty model (with gamma or log-normal frailty
		distribution) and Cox proportional hazard model. Clustered and
		recurrent survival times can be studied. 2) Additive frailty
		models for proportional hazard models with two correlated
		random effects (intercept random effect with random slope). 3)
		Nested frailty models for hierarchically clustered data (with 2
		levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma random
		effects. 4) Joint frailty models in the context of the joint
		modelling for recurrent events with terminal event for
		clustered data or not. A joint frailty model for two semi-
		competing risks and clustered data is also proposed. 5) Joint
		general frailty models in the context of the joint modelling
		for recurrent events with terminal event data with two
		independent frailty terms. 6) Joint Nested frailty models in
		the context of the joint modelling for recurrent events with
		terminal event, for hierarchically clustered data (with two
		levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma random
		effects. 7) Multivariate joint frailty models for two types of
		recurrent events and a terminal event. 8) Joint models for
		longitudinal data and a terminal event. 9) Trivariate joint
		models for longitudinal data, recurrent events and a terminal
		event. 10) Joint frailty models for the validation of surrogate
		endpoints in multiple randomized clinical trials with failure-
		time endpoints with the possibility to use a mediation analysis
		model. 11) Conditional and Marginal two-part joint models for
		longitudinal semicontinuous data and a terminal event. 12)
		Joint frailty-copula models for the validation of surrogate
		endpoints in multiple randomized clinical trials with failure-
		time endpoints. 13) Generalized shared and joint frailty models
		for recurrent and terminal events. Proportional hazards (PH),
		additive hazard (AH), proportional odds (PO) and probit models
		are available in a fully parametric framework. For PH and AH
		models, it is possible to consider type-varying coefficients
		and flexible semiparametric hazard function. Prediction values
		are available (for a terminal event or for a new recurrent
		event). Left-truncated (not for Joint model), right-censored
		data, interval-censored data (only for Cox proportional hazard
		and shared frailty model) and strata are allowed. In each
		model, the random effects have the gamma or normal
		distribution. Now, you can also consider time-varying
		covariates effects in Cox, shared and joint frailty models
		(1-5). The package includes concordance measures for Cox
		proportional hazards models and for shared frailty models.
		Moreover, the package can be used with its shiny application,
		in a local mode or by following the link below.
