		Indirect Effects Testing Methods in Mediation Analysis // Used in
		testing if the indirect effect from linear regression mediation
		analysis is equal to 0. Includes established methods such as
		the Sobel Test, Joint Significant test (maxP), and tests based
		off the distribution of the Product or Normal Random Variables.
		Additionally, this package adds more powerful tests based on
		Intersection-Union theory. These tests are the S-Test, the ps-
		test, and the ascending squares test. These new methods are
		uniformly more powerful than maxP, which is more powerful than
		Sobel and less anti-conservative than the Product of Normal
		Random Variables. These methods are explored by Kidd and Lin,
		(2024) doi:10.1007/s12561-023-09386-6 and Kidd et al., (2025)
