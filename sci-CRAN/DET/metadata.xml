		Representation of DET Curve with Confidence Intervals // Builds
		both ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and DET (Detection
		Error Tradeoff) curves from a set of predictors, which are the
		results of a binary classification system. The curves give a
		general vision of the performance of the classifier, and are
		useful for comparing performance of different systems.
