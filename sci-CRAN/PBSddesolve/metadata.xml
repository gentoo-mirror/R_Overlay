		Solver for Delay Differential Equations // Functions for solving
		systems of delay differential equations by interfacing with
		numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood, including
		contributions from Benjamin J. Cairns. These numerical routines
		first appeared in Simon Wood's 'solv95' program. This package
		includes a vignette and a complete user's guide. 'PBSddesolve'
		originally appeared on CRAN under the name 'ddesolve'. That
		version is no longer supported. The current name emphasizes a
		close association with other 'PBS' packages, particularly
		'PBSmodelling'.
