		Linear Optimal Low-Rank Projection // Supervised learning
		techniques designed for the situation when the dimensionality
		exceeds the sample size have a tendency to overfit as the
		dimensionality of the data increases. To remedy this High
		dimensionality; low sample size (HDLSS) situation, we attempt
		to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the data before
		learning a classifier. That is, we project the data to a
		situation where the dimensionality is more manageable, and then
		are able to better apply standard classification or clustering
		techniques since we will have fewer dimensions to overfit. A
		number of previous works have focused on how to strategically
		reduce dimensionality in the unsupervised case, yet in the
		supervised HDLSS regime, few works have attempted to devise
		dimensionality reduction techniques that leverage the labels
		associated with the data. In this package and the associated
		manuscript Vogelstein et al. (2017) arXiv:1709.01233, we
		provide several methods for feature extraction, some utilizing
		labels and some not, along with easily extensible utilities to
		simplify cross-validative efforts to identify the best feature
		extraction method. Additionally, we include a series of
		adaptable benchmark simulations to serve as a standard for
		future investigative efforts into supervised HDLSS. Finally, we
		produce a comprehensive comparison of the included algorithms
		across a range of benchmark simulations and real data
		applications.
