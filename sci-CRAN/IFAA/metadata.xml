		Robust Analysis for Absolute Abundance in Microbiome // A novel
		approach to make inference on the association of covariates
		with the absolute abundance (AA) of 'microbiome' in an
		ecosystem. It can be also directly applied to relative
		abundance (RA) data to make inference on AA because the ratio
		of two RA is equal ratio of their AA. This algorithm can
		estimate and test the associations of interest while adjusting
		for potential 'confounders'. The estimates of this method have
		easy interpretation like a typical regression analysis. High-
		dimensional covariates are handled with regularization and it
		is implemented by parallel computing. This algorithm finds
		optimal reference 'taxa/OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit)/ASV
		(Amplicon Sequence Bariant)' and uses permutation to control
		FDR (False Discovery Rate) as described in Zhigang Li, et al.
