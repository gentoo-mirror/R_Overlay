		Robust Analysis for Absolute Abundance in Microbiome // A novel
		approach to make inference on the association of covariates
		with the absolute abundance (AA) of 'microbiome' in an
		ecosystem. It can be also directly applied to relative
		abundance (RA) data to make inference on AA (even if AA data is
		not available) because the ratio of two RA is equal ratio of
		their AA. This algorithm can estimate and test the associations
		of interest while adjusting for potential 'confounders'. The
		estimates of this method have easy interpretation like a
		typical regression analysis. High-dimensional covariates are
		handled with regularization and it is implemented by parallel
		computing. This algorithm finds optimal reference 'taxa/OTU
		(Operational Taxonomic Unit)/ASV (Amplicon Sequence Bariant)'
		and uses permutation to control FDR (False Discovery Rate).
