		Robust Inference for Absolute Abundance in Microbiome Analysis //
		IFAA is a robust approach to make inference on the association
		of covariates with the absolute abundance (AA) of microbiome in
		an ecosystem. It can be also directly applied to relative
		abundance (RA) data to make inference on AA because the ratio
		of two RA is equal ratio of their AA. This algorithm can
		estimate and test the associations of interest while adjusting
		for potential confounders. High-dimensional covariates are
		handled with regularization. The estimates of this method have
		easy interpretation like a typical regression analysis. High-
		dimensional covariates are handled with regularization and it
		is implemented by parallel computing. False discovery rate is
		automatically controlled by this approach. Zeros do not need to
		be imputed by a positive value for the analysis. The IFAA
		package also offers the 'MZILN' function for estimating and
		testing associations of abundance ratios with covariates.
