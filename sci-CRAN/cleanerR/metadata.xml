		How to Handle your Missing Data // How to deal with missing
		data?Based on the concept of almost functional dependencies, a
		method is proposed to fill missing data, as well as help you
		see what data is missing. The user can specify a measure of
		error and how many combinations he wish to test the
		dependencies against, the closer to the length of the dataset,
		the more precise. But the higher the number, the more time it
		will take for the process to finish. If the program cannot
		predict with the accuracy determined by the user it shall not
		fill the data, the user then can choose to increase the error
		or deal with the data another way.
