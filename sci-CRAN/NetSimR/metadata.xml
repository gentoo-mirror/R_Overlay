		Actuarial Functions for Non-Life Insurance Modelling // Assists
		actuaries and other insurance modellers in pricing, reserving
		and capital modelling for non-life insurance and reinsurance
		modelling. Provides functions that help model excess levels,
		capping and pure Incurred but not reported claims (pure IBNR).
		Includes capped mean, exposure curves and increased limit
		factor curves (ILFs) for LogNormal, Gamma, Pareto, Sliced
		LogNormal-Pareto and Sliced Gamma-Pareto distributions.
		Includes mean, probability density function (pdf), cumulative
		probability function (cdf) and inverse cumulative probability
		function for Sliced LogNormal-Pareto and Sliced Gamma-Pareto
		distributions. Includes calculating pure IBNR exposure with
		LogNormal and Gamma distribution for reporting delay. Includes
		a shiny tool to simulate insurance claims.
