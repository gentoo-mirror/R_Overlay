		Simplicial Generalized Beta Regression // Main properties and
		regression procedures using a generalization of the Dirichlet
		distribution called Simplicial Generalized Beta distribution.
		It is a new distribution on the simplex (i.e. on the space of
		compositions or positive vectors with sum of components equal
		to 1). The Dirichlet distribution can be constructed from a
		random vector of independent Gamma variables divided by their
		sum. The SGB follows the same construction with generalized
		Gamma instead of Gamma variables. The Dirichlet exponents are
		supplemented by an overall shape parameter and a vector of
		scales. The scale vector is itself a composition and can be
		modeled with auxiliary variables through a log-ratio
		transformation. Graf, M. (2017, ISBN: 978-84-947240-0-8). See
		also the vignette enclosed in the package.
