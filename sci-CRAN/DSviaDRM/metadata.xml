		Exploring Disease Similarity in Terms of Dysfunctional Regulatory
		Mechanisms // Elucidation of human disease similarities has
		emerged as an active research area, which is highly relevant to
		etiology, disease classification, and drug repositioning. This
		package was designed and implemented for identifying disease
		similarities. It contains five functions which are 'DCEA',
		'DCpathway', 'DS', 'comDCGL' and 'comDCGLplot'. In 'DCEA'
		function, differentially co-expressed genes and differentially
		co-expressed links are extracted from disease vs. health
		samples. Then 'DCpathway' function assigns differential co-
		expression values of pathways to be the average differential
		co-expression value of their component genes. Then 'DS' employs
		partial correlation coefficient of pathways as the disease
		similarity for each disease pairs. And 'DS' contains a
		permutation process for evaluating the statistical significant
		of observed disease partial correlation coefficients. At last,
		'comDCGL' and 'comDCGLplot' sort out shared differentially co-
		expressed genes and differentially co-expressed links with
		regulation information and visualize them.
