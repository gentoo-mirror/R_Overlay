		Convert Biological ID from RAP or MSU to SYMBOL for Oryza Sativa
		// Convert one biological ID to another of rice (Oryza sativa).
		Rice(Oryza sativa) has more than one form gene ID for the
		genome. The two main gene ID for rice genome are  the RAP (The
		Rice Annotation Project, https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/, and
		the MSU(The Rice Genome Annotation Project,
		http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/. All RAP rice gene IDs are of
		the form Os##g####### as explained on the website
		https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/. All MSU rice gene IDs are of
		the form LOC_Os##g##### as explained on the website
		http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/analyses_nomenclature.shtml.
		All SYMBOL rice gene IDs are the unique name on the
		NCBI(National Center for Biotechnology Information,
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The TRANSCRIPTID, is the
		transcript id of rice, are of the form Os##t#######. The
		researchers usually need to converter between various IDs. Such
		as converter RAP to SYMBOLS for function searching on NCBI.
		There are a lot of websites with the function for converting
		RAP to MSU or MSU to RA, such as 'ID Converter'
		https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/tools/converter. But it is
		difficult to convert super multiple IDs on these websites. The
		package can convert all IDs between the three IDs (RAP, MSU and
		SYMBOL) regardless of the number.
