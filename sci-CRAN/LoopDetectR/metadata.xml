		Comprehensive Feedback Loop Detection in ODE Models // Detect
		feedback loops (cycles, circuits) between species (nodes) in
		ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. Feedback loops are
		paths from a node to itself without visiting any other node
		twice, and they have important regulatory functions. Loops are
		reported with their order of participating nodes and their
		length, and whether the loop is a positive or a negative
		feedback loop. An upper limit of the number of feedback loops
		limits runtime (which scales with feedback loop count). Model
		parametrizations and values of the modelled variables are
		accounted for. Computation uses the characteristics of the
		Jacobian matrix as described e.g. in Thomas and Kaufman (2002)
		doi:10.1016/s1631-0691(02)01452-x. Input can be the Jacobian
		matrix of the ODE model or the ODE function definition; in the
		latter case, the Jacobian matrix is determined using
		'numDeriv'. Graph-based algorithms from 'igraph' are employed
		for path detection.
