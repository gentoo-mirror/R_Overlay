		Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis // An implementation of
		multivariate linear process bootstrap (MLPB) method and sliding
		window technique to assess the dynamic functional connectivity
		(dFC) estimate by providing its confidence bands, based on
		Maria Kudela (2017) doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.056. It
		also integrates features to visualize non-zero coverage for
		selected a-priori regions of interest estimated by the dynamic
		functional connectivity model (dFCM) and dynamic functional
		connectivity (dFC) curves for reward-related a-priori regions
		of interest where the activation-based analysis reported.
