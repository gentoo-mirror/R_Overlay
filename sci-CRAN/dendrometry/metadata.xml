		Forest Estimations and Dendrometric Computations // Computation
		of dendrometric and structural parameters from forest inventory
		data. The objective is to provide a user-friendly R package for
		researchers, ecologists, foresters, statisticians, loggers and
		other persons who deal with forest inventory data. The package
		includes advanced distribution fitting capabilities with
		multiple estimation methods (Maximum Likelihood, Maximum
		Product Spacing with ties correction methods following Cheng
		Amin (1983), and Method of Moments) for probability
		distributions commonly used in forestry. Visualization tools
		with confidence bands using delta method and parametric
		bootstrap are provided for three-parameter Weibull distribution
		fitting to diameter data. Useful conversion of angle value from
		degree to radian, conversion from angle to slope (in
		percentage) and their reciprocals as well as principal angle
		determination are also included. Position and dispersion
		parameters usually found in forest studies are implemented. The
		package contains Fibonacci series, its extensions and the
		Golden Number computation. Useful references are Arcadius Y. J.
