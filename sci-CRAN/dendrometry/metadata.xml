		Forest Estimations and Dendrometric Computations // Computation
		of dendrometric and structural parameters from forest inventory
		data. The objective is to provide an user-friendly R package
		for researchers, ecologists, foresters, statisticians, loggers
		and others persons who deal with forest inventory data. Useful
		conversion of angle value from degree to radian, conversion
		from angle to slope (in percentage) and their reciprocals as
		well as principal angle determination are also included.
		Position and dispersion parameters usually found in forest
		studies are implemented. The package contains Fibonacci series,
		its extensions and the Golden Number computation. Useful
		references are Arcadius Y. J. Akossou, Soufianou Arzouma, Eloi
		Y. Attakpa, Nol H. Fonton and Kouami Kokou (2013)
