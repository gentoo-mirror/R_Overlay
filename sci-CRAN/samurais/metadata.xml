		Statistical Models for the Unsupervised Segmentation of Time-
		Series ('SaMUraiS') // Provides a variety of original and
		flexible user-friendly statistical latent variable models and
		unsupervised learning algorithms to segment and represent time-
		series data (univariate or multivariate), and more generally,
		longitudinal data, which include regime changes. 'samurais' is
		built upon the following packages, each of them is an
		autonomous time-series segmentation approach: Regression with
		Hidden Logistic Process ('RHLP'), Hidden Markov Model
		Regression ('HMMR'), Multivariate 'RHLP' ('MRHLP'),
		Multivariate 'HMMR' ('MHMMR'), Piece-Wise regression ('PWR').
		For the advantages/differences of each of them, the user is
		referred to our mentioned paper references.
