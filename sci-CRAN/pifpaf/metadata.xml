		Potential Impact Fraction and Population Attributable Fraction
		for Cross-Sectional Data // Uses a generalized method to
		estimate the Potential Impact Fraction (PIF) and the Population
		Attributable Fraction (PAF) from cross-sectional data. It
		creates point-estimates, confidence intervals, and estimates of
		variance. In addition it generates plots for conducting
		sensitivity analysis. The estimation method corresponds to
		Zepeda-Tello,  Camacho-Garca-Forment, et al. 2017.
		'Nonparametric Methods to Estimate the Potential Impact
		Fraction from Cross-sectional Data'. Unpublished manuscript.
