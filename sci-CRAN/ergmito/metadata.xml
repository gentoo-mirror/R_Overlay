		Exponential Random Graph Models for Small Networks // Simulation
		and estimation of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) for
		small networks using exact statistics as shown in Vega Yon et
		al. (2020) DOI:10.1016/j.socnet.2020.07.005. As a difference
		from the 'ergm' package, 'ergmito' circumvents using Markov-
		Chain Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MC-MLE) and instead uses
		Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to fit ERGMs for small
		networks. As exhaustive enumeration is computationally feasible
		for small networks, this R package takes advantage of this and
		provides tools for calculating likelihood functions, and other
		relevant functions, directly, meaning that in many cases both
		estimation and simulation of ERGMs for small networks can be
		faster and more accurate than simulation-based algorithms.
