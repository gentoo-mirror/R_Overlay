		Visualize Balances of Compositional Data // Balances have become
		a cornerstone of compositional data analysis. However,
		conceptualizing balances is difficult, especially for high-
		dimensional data. Most often, investigators visualize balances
		with "balance dendrograms". However, this visualization tool
		does not scale well for large data. This package provides an
		alternative scheme for visualizing balances, described in
		[Quinn (2018) DOI:10.12688/f1000research.15858.1]. This package
		also provides a method for principal balance analysis.
