		Extension for 'DALEX' Package // Provides wrapper of various
		machine learning models. In applied machine learning, there is
		a strong belief that we need to strike a balance between
		interpretability and accuracy. However, in field of the
		interpretable machine learning, there are more and more new
		ideas for explaining black-box models, that are implemented in
		'R'. 'DALEXtra' creates 'DALEX' Biecek (2018) arXiv:1806.08915
		explainer for many type of models including those created using
		'python' 'scikit-learn' and 'keras' libraries, and 'java' 'h2o'
		library. Important part of the package is Champion-Challenger
		analysis and innovative approach to model performance across
		subsets of test data presented in Funnel Plot.
