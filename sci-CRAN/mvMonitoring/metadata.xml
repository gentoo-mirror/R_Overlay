		Multi-State Adaptive Dynamic Principal Component Analysis for
		Multivariate Process Monitoring // Use multi-state splitting to
		apply Adaptive-Dynamic PCA (ADPCA) to data generated from a
		continuous-time multivariate industrial or natural process.
		Employ PCA-based dimension reduction to extract linear
		combinations of relevant features, reducing computational
		burdens. For a description of ADPCA, see
		doi:10.1007/s00477-016-1246-2, the 2016 paper from Kazor et al.
		The multi-state application of ADPCA is from a manuscript under
		current revision entitled "Multi-State Multivariate Statistical
		Process Control" by Odom, Newhart, Cath, and Hering, and is
		expected to appear in Q1 of 2018.
