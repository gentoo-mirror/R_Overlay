		High-Dimensional Shrinkage Optimal Portfolios // Constructs
		shrinkage estimators of high-dimensional mean-variance
		portfolios and performs high-dimensional tests on optimality of
		a given portfolio. The techniques developed in Bodnar et al.
		(2018) doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.09.028, Bodnar et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1109/TSP.2019.2929964, Bodnar et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1109/TSP.2020.3037369 are central to the package. They
		provide simple and feasible estimators and tests for optimal
		portfolio weights, which are applicable for 'large p and large
		n' situations where p is the portfolio dimension (number of
		stocks) and n is the sample size. The package also includes
		tools for constructing portfolios based on shrinkage estimators
		of the mean vector and covariance matrix as well as a new
		Bayesian estimator for the Markowitz efficient frontier
		recently developed by Bauder et al. (2021)
