		High-Dimensional Shrinkage Optimal Portfolios // Applications of
		the shrinkage-type methods for estimation and inference of
		high- dimensional mean-variance portfolios. The techniques
		developed in Bodnar et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.09.028, Bodnar et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1109/TSP.2019.2929964, Bodnar et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1109/TSP.2020.3037369 are central to the package. They
		provide simple and feasible estimators and tests for optimal
		portfolio weights, which are applicable for 'large p and large
		n' situations, where p is the portfolio dimension (number of
		stocks) and n is the sample size. The package also includes
		tools for constructing portfolios with shrinkage means and
		covariance matrices as well as a new Bayesian estimator for the
		Markowitz efficient frontier recently developed by Bauder et
		al. (2021) doi:10.1080/14697688.2020.1748214.
