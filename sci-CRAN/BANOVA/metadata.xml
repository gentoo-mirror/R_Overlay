		Hierarchical Bayesian ANOVA Models // It covers several Bayesian
		Analysis of Variance (BANOVA) models used in analysis of
		experimental designs in which both within- and between-
		subjects factors are manipulated. They can be applied to data
		that are common in the behavioral and social sciences. The
		package includes: Hierarchical Bayes ANOVA models with normal
		response, t response, Binomial (Bernoulli) response, Poisson
		response, ordered multinomial response and multinomial response
		variables. All models accommodate unobserved heterogeneity by
		including a normal distribution of the parameters across
		individuals. Outputs of the package include tables of sums of
		squares, effect sizes and p-values, and tables of predictions,
		which are easily interpretable for behavioral and social
		researchers. The floodlight analysis and mediation analysis
		based on these models are also provided. BANOVA uses 'Stan' and
		'JAGS' as the computational platform. References: Dong and
		Wedel (2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v081.i09; Wedel and Dong (2020)
