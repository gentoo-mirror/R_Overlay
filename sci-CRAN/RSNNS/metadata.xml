		Neural Networks using the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator
		(SNNS) // The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) is a
		library containing many standard implementations of neural
		networks. This package wraps the SNNS functionality to make it
		available from within R. Using the 'RSNNS' low-level interface,
		all of the algorithmic functionality and flexibility of SNNS
		can be accessed. Furthermore, the package contains a convenient
		high-level interface, so that the most common neural network
		topologies and learning algorithms integrate seamlessly into R.
