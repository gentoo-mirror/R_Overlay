		Background Removal and Spectrum Identification for SERS Data //
		Implements a new approach 'SABARSI' described in Wang et al.,
		"A Statistical Approach of Background Removal and Spectrum
		Identification for SERS Data" (Unpublished). Sabarsi forms a
		pipeline for SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering) data
		analysis including background removal, signal detection, signal
		integration, and cross-experiment comparison. The background
		removal algorithm, the very first step of SERS data analysis,
		takes into account the change of background shape.
