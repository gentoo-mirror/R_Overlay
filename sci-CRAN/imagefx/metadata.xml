		Extract Features from Images // Synthesize images into
		characteristic features for time-series analysis or machine
		learning applications.  The package was originally intended for
		monitoring volcanic eruptions in video data by highlighting and
		extracting regions above the vent associated with plume
		activity.  However, the functions within are general and have
		wide applications for image processing, analyzing, filtering,
		and plotting.
