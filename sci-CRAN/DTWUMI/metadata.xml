		Imputation of Multivariate Time Series Based on Dynamic Time
		Warping // Functions to impute large gaps within multivariate
		time series based on Dynamic Time Warping methods. Gaps of size
		1 or inferior to a defined threshold are filled using simple
		average and weighted moving average respectively. Larger gaps
		are filled using the methodology provided by Phan et al. (2017)
		DOI:10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168165: a query is built immediately
		before/after a gap and a moving window is used to find the most
		similar sequence to this query using Dynamic Time Warping. To
		lower the calculation time, similar sequences are pre-selected
		using global features. Contrary to the univariate method
		(package 'DTWBI'), these global features are not estimated over
		the sequence containing the gap(s), but a feature matrix is
		built to summarize general features of the whole multivariate
		signal. Once the most similar sequence to the query has been
		identified, the adjacent sequence to this window is used to
		fill the gap considered. This function can deal with multiple
		gaps over all the sequences componing the input multivariate
		signal. However, for better consistency, large gaps at the same
		location over all sequences should be avoided.
