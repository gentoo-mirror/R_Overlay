		Simple Wrapper for Computationally Expensive Functions // This is
		a one-function package that will pass only unique values to a
		computationally-expensive function that returns an output of
		the same length as the input. In importing and working with
		tidy data, it is common to have index columns, often including
		time stamps that are far from unique. Some functions to work
		with these such as text conversion to other variable types
		(e.g. as.POSIXct()), various grep()-based functions, and often
		the cut() function are relatively slow when working with tens
		of millions of rows or more.
