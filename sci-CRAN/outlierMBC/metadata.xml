		Sequential Outlier Identification for Model-Based Clustering //
		Sequential outlier identification for Gaussian mixture models
		using the distribution of Mahalanobis distances. The optimal
		number of outliers is chosen based on the dissimilarity between
		the theoretical and observed distributions of the scaled
		squared sample Mahalanobis distances. Also includes an
		extension for Gaussian linear cluster-weighted models using the
		distribution of studentized residuals. Doherty, McNicholas, and
		White (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.11668.
