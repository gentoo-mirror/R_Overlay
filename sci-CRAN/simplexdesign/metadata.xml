		Simplex Design for Stochastic Simulations and Agent Based Models
		// Design statistical experiments on agent based models,
		including a coordinate exchange algorithm for homogeneous
		agents, and more generally any simplex.  There is also an
		optimization algorithm for the case with multiple classes of
		homogeneous agents. See our paper "Uncertainty Quantification
		for Models of Homogeneous Agents" for more details when it is
		published.
