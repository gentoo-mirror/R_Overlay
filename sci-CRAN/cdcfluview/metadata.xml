		Retrieve 'U.S'. Flu Season Data from the 'CDC' 'FluView' Portal
		// The 'U.S.' Centers for Disease Control ('CDC') maintains a
		portal http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html
		for accessing state, regional and national influenza statistics
		as well as Mortality Surveillance Data. The web interface makes
		it difficult and time-consuming to select and retrieve
		influenza data. Tools are provided to access the data provided
		by the portal's underlying 'API'.
