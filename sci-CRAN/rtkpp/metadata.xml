		STK++ Integration to R using Rcpp // STK++ (http://www.stkpp.org)
		is a collection of C++ classes for statistics, clustering,
		linear algebra, arrays (with an Eigen-like API), regression,
		dimension reduction, etc. The integration of the library to R
		is using Rcpp. . The rtkpp package includes the header files
		from the STK++ library (currently version 0.8.99). Thus users
		do not need to install STK++ itself in order to use it. . STK++
		is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2 or later. rtkpp (the
		stkpp integration into R) is licensed under the GNU GPL version
		2 or later.
