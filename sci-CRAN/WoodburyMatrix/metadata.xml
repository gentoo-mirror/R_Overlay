		Fast Matrix Operations via the Woodbury Matrix Identity // A
		hierarchy of classes and methods for manipulating matrices
		formed implicitly from the sums of the inverses of other
		matrices, a situation commonly encountered in spatial
		statistics and related fields. Enables easy use of the Woodbury
		matrix identity and the matrix determinant lemma to allow
		computation (e.g., solving linear systems) without having to
		form the actual matrix. More information on the underlying
		linear algebra can be found in Harville, D. A. (1997)
		doi:10.1007/b98818.
