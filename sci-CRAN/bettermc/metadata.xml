		Enhanced Fork-Based Parallelization // Drop-in replacement for
		'parallel::mclapply()' adding e.g. tracebacks, crash dumps,
		retries, condition handling, improved seeding, progress bars
		and faster inter process communication. Some of the internal
		functions are also exported for other use: 'etry()' (extended
		try), 'copy2shm()/allocate_from_shm()' (copy to and allocate
		from POSIX shared memory), 'char_map/map2char()' (split a
		character vector into its unique elements and a mapping on
		these) and various semaphore related functions.
