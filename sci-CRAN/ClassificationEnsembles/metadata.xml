		Automatically Builds 12 Classification Models // Automatically
		builds 12 classification models from data. The package returns
		26 plots, 5 tables and a summary report. The package
		automatically builds six individual classification models,
		including error (RMSE) and predictions. That data is used to
		create an ensemble, which is then modeled using six methods.
		The process is repeated as many times as the user requests. The
		mean of the results are presented in a summary table. The
		package returns the confusion matrices for all 12 models,
		tables of the correlation of the numeric data, the results of
		the variance inflation process, the head of the ensemble and
		the head of the data frame.
