		Functions to Support Data Management and Processing Using the
		Maelstrom Research Approach // Functions to support data
		cleaning, evaluation, and description, developed for
		integration with Maelstrom Research software tools. 'madshapR'
		provides functions primarily to evaluate and manipulate
		datasets and data dictionaries in preparation for data
		harmonization with the package 'Rmonize' and to facilitate
		integration and transfer between RStudio servers and secure
		Opal environments. 'madshapR' functions can be used
		independently but are optimized in conjunction with Rmonize
		functions for streamlined and coherent harmonization
		processing.
