		Detect Elevations and Gaps in Mapped Sequencing Read Coverage //
		Automate the detection of gaps and elevations in mapped
		sequencing read coverage using a 2D pattern-matching algorithm.
		'ProActive' detects, characterizes and visualizes read coverage
		patterns in both genomes and metagenomes. Optionally, users may
		provide gene annotations associated with their genome or
		metagenome in the form of a .gff file. In this case,
		'ProActive' will generate an additional output table containing
		the gene annotations found within the detected regions of
		gapped and elevated read coverage. Additionally, users can
		search for gene annotations of interest in the output read
		coverage plots.
