		MCMC for Spike and Slab Regression // Spike and slab regression
		with a variety of residual error distributions corresponding to
		Gaussian, Student T, probit, logit, SVM, and a few others.
		Spike and slab regression is Bayesian regression with prior
		distributions containing a point mass at zero.  The posterior
		updates the amount of mass on this point, leading to a
		posterior distribution that is actually sparse, in the sense
		that if you sample from it many coefficients are actually
		zeros.  Sampling from this posterior distribution is an elegant
		way to handle Bayesian variable selection and model averaging.
		See DOI:10.1504/IJMMNO.2014.059942 for an explanation of the
		Gaussian case.
