		Pretest Probability for Coronary Artery Disease // An application
		to calculate a patient's pretest probability (PTP) for
		obstructive Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) from a collection of
		guidelines or studies. Guidelines usually comes from the
		American Heart Association (AHA), American College of
		Cardiology (ACC) or European Society of Cardiology (ESC).
		Examples of PTP scores that comes from studies are the 2020
		Winther et al. basic, Risk Factor-weighted Clinical Likelihood
		(RF-CL) and Coronary Artery Calcium Score-weighted Clinical
		Likelihood (CACS-CL) models doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.585,
		2019 Reeh et al. basic and clinical models
		doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehy806 and 2017 Fordyce et al. PROMISE
		Minimal-Risk Tool doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2016.5501.  As
		diagnosis of CAD involves a costly and invasive coronary
		angiography procedure for patients, having a reliable PTP for
		CAD helps doctors to make better decisions during patient
		management.  This ensures high risk patients can be diagnosed
		and treated early for CAD while avoiding unnecessary testing
		for low risk patients.
