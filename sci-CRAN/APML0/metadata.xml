		Augmented and Penalized Minimization Method L0 // Fit linear and
		Cox models regularized with L0, lasso (L1), elastic-net (L1 and
		L2), or net (L1 and Laplacian) penalty, and their adaptive
		forms, such as adaptive lasso / elastic-net and net adjusting
		for signs of linked coefficients. It solves L0 penalty problem
		by simultaneously selecting regularization parameters and the
		number of non-zero coefficients. This augmented and penalized
		minimization method provides an approximation solution to the
		L0 penalty problem, but runs as fast as L1 regularization
		problem. The package uses one-step coordinate descent algorithm
		and runs extremely fast by taking into account the sparsity
		structure of coefficients. It could deal with very high
		dimensional data and has superior selection performance.
