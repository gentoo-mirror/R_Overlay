		Blended Survival Curves // Create a blended curve from two
		survival curves, which is particularly useful for survival
		extrapolation in health technology assessment. The main idea is
		to mix a flexible model that fits the observed data well with a
		parametric model that encodes assumptions about long-term
		survival. The two curves are blended into a single survival
		curve that is identical to the first model over the range of
		observed times and gradually approaches the parametric model
		over the extrapolation period based on a given weight function.
		This approach allows for the inclusion of external information,
		such as data from registries or expert opinion, to guide long-
		term extrapolations, especially when dealing with immature
		trial data. See Che et al. (2022)
