		Project Management Tools // Tools for data importation, recoding,
		and inspection that are used at the University of Kansas Center
		for Research Methods and Data Analysis. There are functions to
		create new project folders, R code templates, create uniquely
		named output directories, and to quickly obtain a visual
		summary for each variable in a data frame.  The main feature
		here is the systematic implementation of the "variable key"
		framework for data importation and recoding.  We are eager to
		have community feedback about the variable key and the vignette
		about it. In version 1.67, the function semTable() is
		deprecated. We have proposed a new package of that name.
