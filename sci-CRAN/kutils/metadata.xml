		Project Management Tools // Tools for data importation, recoding,
		and inspection. There are functions to create new project
		folders, R code templates, create uniquely named output
		directories, and to quickly obtain a visual summary for each
		variable in a data frame.  The main feature here is the
		systematic implementation of the "variable key" framework for
		data importation and recoding.  We are eager to have community
		feedback about the variable key and the vignette about it. In
		version 1.7, the function 'semTable' is removed. It was
		deprecated since 1.67. That is provided in a separate package,
		'semTable'.
