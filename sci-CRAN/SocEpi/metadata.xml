		Health Inequality Analysis // Tools for calculating deprivation
		measures and analysing health outcomes and mortality by
		deprivation. Included are the functions: zscore() and
		w_pcntile() for developing deprivation measures and the
		functions smr(), st_rate() and rii() for calculating
		standardized mortality ratios, direct standardized rates and
		Slope and Relative indices of Inequality (SII and RII). Test
		data is included (dep_data and health_data). The RII/SII are
		calculated following Pamuk ER (1985)
		doi:10.1080/0032472031000141256. The confidence intervals for
		SII/RII are calculated using a multinomial distribution as
		described in Lumme et al (2015) doi:10.1007/s10742-015-0137-1.
