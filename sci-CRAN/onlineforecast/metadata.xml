		Forecast Modelling for Online Applications // A framework for
		fitting adaptive forecasting models. Provides a way to use
		forecasts as input to models, e.g. weather forecasts for energy
		related forecasting. The models can be fitted recursively and
		can easily be setup for updating parameters when new data
		arrives. See the included vignettes, the website
		https://onlineforecasting.org and the pre-print paper
		"onlineforecast: An R package for adaptive and recursive
		forecasting" arXiv:2109.12915.
