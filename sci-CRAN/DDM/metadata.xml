		Death Registration Coverage Estimation // A set of three two-
		census methods to the estimate the degree of death registration
		coverage for a population. Implemented methods include the
		Generalized Growth Balance method (GGB), the Synthetic Extinct
		Generation method (SEG), and a hybrid of the two, GGB-SEG. Each
		method offers automatic estimation, but users may also specify
		exact parameters or use a graphical interface to guess
		parameters in the traditional way if desired.
