		An Interface to 'SUNDIALS' Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
		Solvers // Provides a way to call the functions in 'SUNDIALS' C
		ODE solving library
		(https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials). Currently the
		serial version of ODE solver, 'CVODE', sensitivity calculator
		'CVODES' and differential algebraic solver 'IDA' from the
		'SUNDIALS' library are implemented. The package requires ODE to
		be written as an 'R' or 'Rcpp' function and does not require
		the 'SUNDIALS' library to be installed on the local machine.
