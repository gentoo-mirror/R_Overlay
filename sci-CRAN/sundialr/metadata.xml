		An Interface to 'SUNDIALS' Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
		Solvers // Provides a way to call the functions in 'SUNDIALS' C
		ODE solving library
		(https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials). Currently the
		serial version of ODE solver, 'CVODE' from the library can be
		accessed. The package requires ODE to be written as an 'R' or
		'Rcpp' function and does not require the 'SUNDIALS' library to
		be installed on the local machine.
