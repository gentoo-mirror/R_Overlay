		Automatic Generation of Qualitative Color Palettes // Automatic
		generation of maximally distinct qualitative color palettes,
		optionally tailored to color deficiency. A list of colors or a
		subspace of a color space is used as input and then projected
		to the DIN99d color space, where colors that are maximally
		distinct are chosen algorithmically.
