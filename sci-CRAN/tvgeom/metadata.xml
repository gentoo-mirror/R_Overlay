		The Time-Varying (Right-Truncated) Geometric Distribution //
		Probability mass (d), distribution (p), quantile (q), and
		random number generating (r and rt) functions for the time-
		varying right-truncated geometric (tvgeom) distribution. Also
		provided are functions to calculate the first and second
		central moments of the distribution. The tvgeom distribution is
		similar to the geometric distribution, but the probability of
		success is allowed to vary at each time step, and there are a
		limited number of trials. This distribution is essentially a
		Markov chain, and it is useful for modeling Markov chain
		systems with a set number of time steps.
