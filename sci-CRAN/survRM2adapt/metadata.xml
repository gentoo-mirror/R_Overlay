		Flexible and Coherent Test/Estimation Procedure Based on
		Restricted Mean Survival Times // Estimates the restricted mean
		survival time (RMST) with the time window [0, tau], where tau
		is adaptively selected from the procedure, proposed by
		Horiguchi et al. (2018) doi:10.1002/sim.7661. It also estimates
		the RMST with the time window [tau1, tau2], where tau1 is
		adaptively selected from the procedure, proposed by Horiguchi
		et al. (2023) doi:10.1002/sim.9662.
