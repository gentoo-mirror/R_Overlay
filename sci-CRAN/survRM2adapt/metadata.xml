		Flexible and Coherent Test/Estimation Procedure Based on
		Restricted Mean Survival Times // Performs the procedure
		proposed by Horiguchi et al. (2018) doi:10.1002/sim.7661. The
		method specifies a set of truncation time points tau's for
		calculating restricted mean survival times (RMST), performs
		testing for equality, and estimates the difference in RMST
		between two groups at the specified tau's. Multiplicity by
		specifying several tau's is taken into account in this
		procedure.
