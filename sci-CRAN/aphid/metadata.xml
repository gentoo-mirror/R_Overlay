		Analysis with Profile Hidden Markov Models // Designed for the
		development and application of hidden Markov models and profile
		HMMs for biological sequence analysis. Contains functions for
		multiple and pairwise sequence alignment, model construction
		and parameter optimization, file import/export, implementation
		of the forward, backward and Viterbi algorithms for conditional
		sequence probabilities, tree-based sequence weighting, and
		sequence simulation. Features a wide variety of potential
		applications including database searching, gene-finding and
		annotation, phylogenetic analysis and sequence classification.
