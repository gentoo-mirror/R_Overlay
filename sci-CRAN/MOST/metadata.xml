		Multiphase Optimization Strategy // Provides functions similar to
		the 'SAS' macros previously provided to accompany Collins,
		Dziak, and Li (2009) DOI:10.1037/a0015826 and Dziak, Nahum-
		Shani, and Collins (2012) DOI:10.1037/a0026972, papers which
		outline practical benefits and challenges of factorial and
		fractional factorial experiments for scientists interested in
		developing biological and/or behavioral interventions,
		especially in the context of the multiphase optimization
		strategy (see Collins, Kugler  Gwadz 2016)
		DOI:10.1007/s10461-015-1145-4.  The package currently contains
		three functions. First, RelativeCosts1() draws a graph of the
		relative cost of complete and reduced factorial designs versus
		other alternatives. Second, RandomAssignmentGenerator() returns
		a dataframe which contains a list of random numbers that can be
		used to conveniently assign participants to conditions in an
		experiment with many conditions. Third, FactorialPowerPlan()
		estimates the power, detectable effect size, or required sample
		size of a factorial or fractional factorial experiment, for
		main effects or interactions, given several possible choices of
		effect size metric, and allowing pretests and clustering.
