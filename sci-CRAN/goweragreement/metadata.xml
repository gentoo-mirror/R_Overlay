		Bayesian Gower Agreement for Categorical Data // Provides tools
		for applying the Bayesian Gower agreement methodology
		(presented in the package vignette) to nominal or ordinal data.
		The framework can accommodate any number of units, any number
		of coders, and missingness; and can handle both one-way and
		two-way random study designs. Influential units and/or coders
		can be identified easily using leave-one-out statistics.
