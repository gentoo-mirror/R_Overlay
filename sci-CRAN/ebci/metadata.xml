		Robust Empirical Bayes Confidence Intervals // Computes empirical
		Bayes confidence estimators and confidence intervals in a
		normal means model. The intervals are robust in the sense that
		they achieve correct coverage regardless of the distribution of
		the means. If the means are treated as fixed, the intervals
		have an average coverage guarantee. The implementation is based
		on Armstrong, Kolesr and Plagborg-Mller (2020)
		arXiv:2004.03448.
