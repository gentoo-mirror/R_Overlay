		Work with Hypergraphs in R // Create and manipulate hypergraph
		objects. This early version of rhype allows for the output of
		matrices associated with the hypergraphs themselves. It also
		uses these matrices to calculate hypergraph spectra and perform
		spectral comparison. Functionality coming soon includes
		calculation of hyperpaths and hypergraph centrality measures.
