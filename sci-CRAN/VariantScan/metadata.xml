		A Machine Learning Tool for Genetic Association Studies //
		Portable, scalable and highly computationally efficient tool
		for genetic association studies."VariantScan" provides a set of
		machine learning methods (Linear, Local Polynomial Regression
		Fitting and Generalized Additive Model with Local Polynomial
		Smoothing) for genetic association studies that test for
		disease or trait association with genetic variants (biomarkers,
		e.g.,genomic (genetic loci), transcriptomic (gene expressions),
		epigenomic (methylations), proteomic (proteins), metabolomic
		(metabolites)). It is particularly useful when local
		associations and complex nonlinear associations exist.
