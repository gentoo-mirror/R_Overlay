		Nonparametric Combination of Hypothesis Tests // An
		implementation of nonparametric combination of hypothesis
		tests. This package performs nonparametric combination (Pesarin
		and Salmaso 2010), a permutation-based procedure for jointly
		testing multiple hypotheses. The tests are conducted under the
		global "sharp" null hypothesis of no effects, and the component
		tests are combined on the metric of their p-values. A key
		feature of nonparametric combination is that it accounts for
		the dependence among tests under the null hypothesis. In
		addition to the "NPC" function, which performs nonparametric
		combination itself, the package also contains a number of
		helper functions, many of which calculate a test statistic
		given an input of data.
