		Efficient Iterator for Permutations and Combinations // Iterator
		for generating permutations and combinations. They can be
		either drawn with or without replacement, or with distinct/
		non-distinct items (multiset). The generated sequences are in
		lexicographical order (dictionary order). The algorithms to
		generate permutations and combinations are memory efficient.
		These iterative algorithms enable users to process all
		sequences without putting all results in the memory at the same
		time. The algorithms are written in C/C++ for faster
		performance.
