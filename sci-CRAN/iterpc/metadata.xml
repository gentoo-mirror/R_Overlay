		Efficient Iterators for Permutations and Combinations // A
		collection of iterators for generating permutations and
		combinations with or without replacement; with distinct items
		or non-distinct items (multiset). The generated sequences are
		in lexicographical order (dictionary order). The algorithms to
		generate permutations and combinations are memory efficient.
		These iterative algorithms enable users to process all
		sequences without putting all results in the memory at the same
		time. The algorithms are written in C/C++ for faster
		performances.
