		Calculate Weather Indices // Weather indices represent the
		overall weekly effect of a weather variable on crop yield
		throughout the cropping season. This package contains functions
		that can convert the weekly weather data into yearly weighted
		Weather indices with weights being the correlation coefficient
		between weekly weather data over the years and crop yield over
		the years. This can be done for an individual weather variable
		and for two weather variables at a time as the interaction
		effect. This method was first devised by Jain, RC, Agrawal R,
		and Jha, MP (1980), "Effect of climatic variables on rice yield
		and its forecast",MAUSAM, 31(4), 591596,
		doi:10.54302/mausam.v31i4.3477. Later, the method have been
		used by various researchers and the latest can found in Gupta,
		AK, Sarkar, KA, Dhakre, DS,  Bhattacharya, D (2022), "Weather
		Based Potato Yield Modelling using Statistical and Machine
		Learning Technique",Environment and Ecology, 40(3B),
		14441449,https://www.environmentandecology.com/volume-40-2022.
