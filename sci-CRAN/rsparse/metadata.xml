		Statistical Learning on Sparse Matrices // Implements many
		algorithms for statistical learning on sparse matrices - matrix
		factorizations, matrix completion, elastic net regressions,
		factorization machines. Also 'rsparse' enhances 'Matrix'
		package by providing methods for multithreaded sparse, dense
		matrix products and native slicing of the sparse matrices in
		Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. List of the algorithms for
		regression problems: 1) Elastic Net regression via Follow The
		Proximally-Regularized Leader (FTRL) Stochastic Gradient
		Descent (SGD), as per McMahan et al(,
		doi:10.1145/2487575.2488200) 2) Factorization Machines via SGD,
		as per Rendle (2010, doi:10.1109/ICDM.2010.127) List of
		algorithms for matrix factorization and matrix completion: 1)
		Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF) via
		Alternating Least Squares (ALS) - paper by Hu, Koren, Volinsky
		(2008, doi:10.1109/ICDM.2008.22) 2) Maximum-Margin Matrix
		Factorization via ALS, paper by Rennie, Srebro (2005,
		doi:10.1145/1102351.1102441) 3) Fast Truncated Singular Value
		Decomposition (SVD), Soft-Thresholded SVD, Soft-Impute matrix
		completion via ALS - paper by Hastie, Mazumder et al. (2014,
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1410.2596) 4) Linear-Flow matrix
		factorization, from 'Practical linear models for large-scale
		one-class collaborative filtering' by Sedhain, Bui, Kawale et
		al (2016, ISBN:978-1-57735-770-4) 5) GlobalVectors (GloVe)
		matrix factorization via SGD, paper by Pennington, Socher,
		Manning (2014, https://aclanthology.org/D14-1162/) Package is
		reasonably fast and memory efficient - it allows to work with
		large datasets - millions of rows and millions of columns. This
		is particularly useful for practitioners working on recommender
		systems.
