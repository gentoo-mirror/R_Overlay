		Landscape Utility Toolbox // Provides utility functions for some
		of the less-glamorous tasks involved in landscape analysis. It
		includes functions to coerce raster data to the common tibble
		format and vice versa, it helps with flexible reclassification
		tasks of raster data and it provides a function to merge
		multiple raster. Furthermore, 'landscapetools' helps landscape
		scientists to visualize their data by providing optional themes
		and utility functions to plot single landscapes, rasterstacks,
		-bricks and lists of raster.
