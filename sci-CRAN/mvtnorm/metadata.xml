		Multivariate Normal and t Distributions // Computes multivariate
		normal and t probabilities, quantiles, random deviates, and
		densities. Log-likelihoods for multivariate Gaussian models and
		Gaussian copulae parameterised by Cholesky factors of
		covariance or precision matrices are implemented for interval-
		censored and exact data, or a mix thereof. Score functions for
		these log-likelihoods are available. A class representing
		multiple lower triangular matrices and corresponding methods
		are part of this package.
