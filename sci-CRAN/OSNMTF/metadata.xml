		Orthogonal Sparse Non-Negative Matrix Tri-Factorization // A
		novel method to implement cancer subtyping and subtype specific
		drug targets identification via non-negative matrix tri-
		factorization. To improve the interpretability, we introduce
		orthogonal constraint to the row coefficient matrix and column
		coefficient matrix. To meet the prior knowledge that each
		subtype should be strongly associated with few gene sets, we
		introduce sparsity constraint to the association sub-matrix.
		The average residue was introduced to evaluate the row and
		column cluster numbers. This is part of the work "Liver Cancer
		Analysis via Orthogonal Sparse Non-Negative Matrix Tri-
		Factorization" which will be submitted to BBRC.
