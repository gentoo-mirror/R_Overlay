		Assessing Proximal, Distal, and Mediated Causal Excursion Effects
		for Micro-Randomized Trials // Provides methods to analyze
		micro-randomized trials (MRTs) with binary treatment options.
		Supports three types of analyses: (1) proximal causal excursion
		effects, including weighted and centered least squares (WCLS)
		for continuous proximal outcomes by Boruvka et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1305274 and the estimator for
		marginal excursion effect (EMEE) for binary proximal outcomes
		by Qian et al. (2021) doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa070; (2) distal
		causal excursion effects (DCEE) for continuous distal outcomes
		using a two-stage estimator by Qian (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2502.13500; and (3) mediated causal
		excursion effects (MCEE) for continuous distal outcomes,
		estimating natural direct and indirect excursion effects in the
		presence of time-varying mediators by Qian (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2506.20027.
