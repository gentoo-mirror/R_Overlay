		Primary and Secondary Analyses for Micro-Randomized Trials //
		Calculate estimates, confidence intervals, standard errors, and
		p-values for marginal causal excursion effects and moderated
		causal excursion effects for micro-randomized trial (MRT).
		Applicable to MRT with binary treatment options and continuous
		or binary outcomes. The method for MRT with continuous outcomes
		is the weighted centered least squares (WCLS) by Boruvka et al.
		(2018) doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1305274. The method for MRT
		with binary outcomes is the estimator for marginal excursion
		effect (EMEE) by Qian et al. (2021) doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa070.
