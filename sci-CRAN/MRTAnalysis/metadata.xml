		Assessing Proximal and Distal Causal Excursion Effects for Micro-
		Randomized Trials // Estimates marginal causal excursion
		effects and moderated causal excursion effects for micro-
		randomized trial (MRT). Applicable to MRT with binary treatment
		options and continuous or binary outcomes. The method for MRT
		with continuous outcomes is the weighted centered least squares
		(WCLS) by Boruvka et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1305274. The method for MRT with
		binary outcomes is the estimator for marginal excursion effect
		(EMEE) by Qian et al. (2021) doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa070.
		Estimates marginal and moderated causal excursion effects for
		micro-randomized trials (MRTs) with binary treatment options.
		Supports continuous and binary proximal outcomes as well as
		distal outcomes. Methods include weighted and centered least
		squares (WCLS) for continuous proximal outcomes by Boruvka et
		al. (2018) doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1305274, the estimator for
		marginal excursion effect (EMEE) for binary proximal outcomes
		by Qian et al. (2021) doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa070, and two-stage
		estimation of distal causal excursion effects (DCEE)  for
		continuous distal outcomes doi:10.48550/arXiv.2502.13500.
