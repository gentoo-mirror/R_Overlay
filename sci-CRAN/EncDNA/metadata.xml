		Encoding of Nucleotide Sequences into Numeric Feature Vectors //
		We describe fifteen different splice site sequence encoding
		schemes that have been used in earlier studies for mapping of
		splice site sequences into numeric feature vectors. These
		encoding schemes will also be helpful for transforming other
		nucleotide sequences into numeric forms, provided they are of
		equal length. These encoding schemes will help the
		computational biologist working in the field of classification
		(binary or multiclass) or prediction involving nucleic acid
		sequences of equal length.
