		Robust Coefficient Alpha and Omega with Missing and Non-Normal
		Data // Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega are widely used
		reliability or internal consistency measures in social,
		behavioral and education sciences. Alpha is reported in nearly
		every study that involves measuring a construct through
		multiple test items. The package 'coefficientalpha' calculates
		coefficient alpha and coefficient omega with missing data and
		non-normal data. Robust standard errors and confidence
		intervals are also provided. A test is also available to test
		the tau-equivalent and homogeneous assumptions. Since Version
		0.5, the bootstrap confidence intervals were added.
