		A Framework for Variance Reduction // In order to make it easy to
		use variance reduction algorithms for any simulation, this
		framework can help you. We propose user friendly and easy to
		extend framework. Antithetic Variates, Inner Control Variates,
		Outer Control Variates and Importance Sampling algorithms are
		available in the framework. User can write its own simulation
		function and use the Variance Reduction techniques in this
		package to obtain more efficient simulations. An implementation
		of Asian Option simulation is already available within the
		package. See Kemal Diner Dinge  Wolfgang Hrmann (2012)
