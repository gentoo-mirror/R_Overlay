		Mean Comparison in 'ggplot2' // Add mean comparison annotations
		to a 'ggplot'. This package provides an easy way to indicate if
		two or more groups are significantly different in a 'ggplot'.
		Usually you do not need to specify the test method, you only
		need to tell stat_compare() whether you want to perform a
		parametric test or a nonparametric test, and stat_compare()
		will automatically choose the appropriate test method based on
		your data. For comparisons between two groups, the p-value is
		calculated by t-test (parametric) or Wilcoxon rank sum test
		(nonparametric). For comparisons among more than two groups,
		the p-value is calculated by One-way ANOVA (parametric) or
		Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric).
