		Adds Subtotals to Data Reports // Adds subtotal rows / sections
		(a la the SAS "Proc Tabulate" "All" option) to a Group By
		output by running a series of Group By functions with partial
		sets of the same variables and combining the results with the
		original. Can be used to add comprehensive information to a
		data report or to quickly aggregate Group By outputs used to
		gain a greater understanding of data.
