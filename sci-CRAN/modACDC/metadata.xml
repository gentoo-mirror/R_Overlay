		Association of Covariance for Detecting Differential Co-
		Expression // A series of functions to implement association of
		covariance for detecting differential co-expression (ACDC), a
		novel approach for detection of differential co-expression that
		simultaneously accommodates multiple phenotypes or exposures
		with binary, ordinal, or continuous data types. Users can use
		the default method which identifies modules by Partition or may
		supply their own modules. Also included are functions to choose
		an information loss criterion (ILC) for Partition using OmicS-
		data-based Complex trait Analysis (OSCA). The manuscript
		describing these methods is as follows: Queen K, Nguyen MN,
		Gilliland F, Chun S, Raby BA, Millstein J. "ACDC: a general
		approach for detecting phenotype or exposure associated co-
		expression" (2023) https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389
		/fmed.2023.1118824/abstract.
