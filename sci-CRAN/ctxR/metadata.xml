		Utilities for Interacting with the 'CTX' APIs // Access chemical,
		hazard, bioactivity, and exposure data from the Computational
		Toxicology and Exposure ('CTX') APIs https://api-
		ccte.epa.gov/docs/. 'ctxR' was developed to streamline the
		process of accessing the information available through the
		'CTX' APIs without requiring prior knowledge of how to use
		APIs. Most data is also available on the CompTox Chemical
		Dashboard ('CCD') https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/ and other
		resources found at the EPA Computational Toxicology and
		Exposure Online Resources https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools.
