		The Fill-Mask Association Test // The Fill-Mask Association Test
		('FMAT') is an integrative, versatile, and probability-based
		method that uses Masked Language Models to measure conceptual
		associations or relations (e.g., attitudes, biases,
		stereotypes, social norms, cultural values) as propositional
		representations in natural language. The supported language
		models include 'BERT' (Devlin et al., 2018) arXiv:1810.04805
		and its model variants available at 'Hugging Face'
		https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=fill-mask. 'Python'
		('conda') environment and the 'transformers' module can be
		installed automatically using the FMAT_load() function.
		Methodological references and technical details are provided at
		https://psychbruce.github.io/FMAT/.
