		Univariate Time Series Forecasting // An engine for univariate
		time series forecasting using different regression models in an
		autoregressive way. The engine provides an uniform interface
		for applying the different models. Furthermore, it is
		extensible so that users can easily apply their own regression
		models to univariate time series forecasting and benefit from
		all the features of the engine, such as preprocessings or
		estimation of forecast accuracy.
