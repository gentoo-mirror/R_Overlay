		Bootstrap a Clustering Solution to Establish the Stability of the
		Clusters // Providing a cluster allocation for n samples,
		either with an $n \times p$ data matrix or an $n \times n$
		distance matrix, a bootstrap procedure is performed. The
		proportion of bootstrap replicates where a pair of samples
		cluster in the same cluster indicates who tightly the samples
		in a particular cluster clusters together.
