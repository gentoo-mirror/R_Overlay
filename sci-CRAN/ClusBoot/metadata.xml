		Bootstrap Clustering // Clustering algorithms are designed to
		cluster objects into a number of clusters. Any clustering
		algorithm provides the 'best' grouping of objects according to
		some criterion. This does not guarantee a 'good' clustering
		solution in the sense that some allocations were not simply the
		result of chance. This package allows the user to apply any
		clustering algorithm to a data set. The cluster allocations are
		subjected to a bootstrap analysis to determine the extent to
		which the clustering structure is stable and fundamental to the
		data set. For more information see https://slubbe.wixsite.com
