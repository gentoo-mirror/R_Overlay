		Numeric and Visual Comparisons of Heterogeneity in Parametric
		Models // Performs statistical tests to compare coefficients
		and residual variance across multiple models. Also provides
		graphical methods for assessing heterogeneity in coefficients
		and residuals. Currently supports linear and generalized linear
		models, as well as their multi-level and complex survey-
		weighted variations from the 'lme4' and 'survey' packages,
		respectively. Reference: Li (2015)
