		Lotka-Volterra Models for Gause's 'Struggle for Existence' // A
		collection of tools and data for analyzing the Gause microcosm
		experiments, and for fitting Lotka-Volterra models to time
		series data. Includes methods for fitting single-species
		logistic growth, and multi-species interaction models, e.g. of
		competition, predator/prey relationships, or mutualism. See
		documentation for individual functions for examples. In
		general, see the lv_optim() function for examples of how to fit
		parameter values in multi-species systems. Note that the
		general methods applied here, as well as the form of the
		differential equations that we use, are described in detail in
		the Quantitative Ecology textbook by Lehman et al., available
		at http://hdl.handle.net/11299/204551, and in Lina K. Mhlbauer,
		Maximilienne Schulze, W. Stanley Harpole, and Adam T. Clark.
