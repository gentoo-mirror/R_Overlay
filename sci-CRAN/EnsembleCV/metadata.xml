		Extensible Package for Cross-Validation-Based Integration of Base
		Learners // Extends the base classes and methods of
		EnsembleBase package for cross-validation-based integration of
		base learners. Default implementation calculates average of
		repeated CV errors, and selects the base learner /
		configuration with minimum average error. The package takes
		advantage of the file method provided in EnsembleBase package
		for writing estimation objects to disk in order to circumvent
		RAM bottleneck. Special save and load methods are provided to
		allow estimation objects to be saved to permanent files on
		disk, and to be loaded again into temporary files in a later R
		session. The package can be extended, e.g. by adding variants
		of the current implementation.
