		Sensitivity Assessment to Unmeasured Confounding with Multiple
		Treatments // A sensitivity analysis approach for unmeasured
		confounding in observational data with multiple treatments and
		a binary outcome. This approach derives the general bias
		formula and provides adjusted causal effect estimates in
		response to various assumptions about the degree of unmeasured
		confounding. Nested multiple imputation is embedded within the
		Bayesian framework to integrate   uncertainty about the
		sensitivity parameters and sampling variability.  Bayesian
		Additive Regression Model (BART) is used for outcome modeling.
		The causal estimands are the conditional average treatment
		effects (CATE) based on the risk difference.  For more details,
		see paper: Hu L et al. (2020) A flexible sensitivity analysis
		approach for unmeasured confounding with a multiple treatments
		and a binary outcome arXiv:2012.06093.
