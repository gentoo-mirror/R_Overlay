		Unbiased Distances for Mixed-Type Data // A comprehensive
		framework for calculating unbiased distances in datasets
		containing mixed-type variables (numerical and categorical).
		The package implements a general formulation that ensures
		multivariate additivity and commensurability, meaning that
		variables contribute equally to the overall distance regardless
		of their type, scale, or distribution. Supports multiple
		distance measures including Gower's distance, Euclidean
		distance, Manhattan distance, and various categorical variable
		distances such as simple matching, Eskin, occurrence frequency,
		and association-based distances. Provides tools for variable
		scaling (standard deviation, range, robust range, and principal
		component scaling), and handles both independent and
		association-based category dissimilarities. Implements methods
		to correct for biases that typically arise from different
		variable types, distributions, and number of categories.
		Particularly useful for cluster analysis, data visualization,
		and other distance-based methods when working with mixed data.
		Methods based on van de Velden et al. (2024)
