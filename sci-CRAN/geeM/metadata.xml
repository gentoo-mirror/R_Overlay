		Solve Generalized Estimating Equations // GEE estimation of the
		parameters in mean structures with possible correlation between
		the outcomes. User-specified mean link and variance functions
		are allowed, along with observation weighting. The 'M' in the
		name 'geeM' is meant to emphasize the use of the Matrix
		package, which allows for an implementation based fully in R.
