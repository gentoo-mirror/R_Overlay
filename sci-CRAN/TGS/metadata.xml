		Rapid Reconstruction of Time-Varying Gene Regulatory Networks //
		Rapid advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing
		technologies have resulted in genome-scale time-series
		datasets. Uncovering the underlying temporal sequence of gene
		regulatory events in the form of time-varying gene regulatory
		networks demands accurate and computationally efficient
		algorithms. Such an algorithm is 'TGS'. It is proposed in
		Saptarshi Pyne, Alok Ranjan Kumar, and Ashish Anand. Rapid
		reconstruction of time-varying gene regulatory networks.
		IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and
		Bioinformatics, 17(1):278{291, Jan-Feb 2020. The TGS algorithm
		is shown to consume only 29 minutes for a microarray dataset
		with 4028 genes. This package provides an implementation of the
		TGS algorithm and its variants.
