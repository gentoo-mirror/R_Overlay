		Rapid Reconstruction of Time-Varying Gene Regulatory Networks //
		Rapid advancement in high-throughput gene expression
		measurement technologies has resulted in genome- scale time
		series datasets. Uncovering the underlying temporal sequence of
		gene regulatory events in the form of time-varying Gene
		Regulatory Networks (GRNs) demands computationally fast,
		accurate and highly scalable algorithms. To provide a flexible
		framework in a significantly time-efficient manner, a novel
		algorithm, namely TGS (Ashish Anand et al., 2018
		doi:10.1109/TCBB.2018.2861698), is proposed here. TGS is shown
		to consume only 29 minutes for a microarray dataset with 4028
		genes. Moreover, it provides the flexibility and time-
		efficiency, without losing the accuracy. Nevertheless, TGSs
		main memory requirement grows exponentially with the number of
		genes, which it tackles by restricting the maximum number of
		regulators for each gene. Relaxing this restriction remains an
		important challenge as the true number of regulators is not
		known a prior.
