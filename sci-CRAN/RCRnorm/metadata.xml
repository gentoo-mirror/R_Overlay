		An Integrated Regression Model for Normalizing 'NanoString
		nCounter' Data // 'NanoString nCounter' is a medium-throughput
		platform that measures gene or microRNA expression levels. Here
		is a publication that introduces this platform: Malkov (2009)
		doi:10.1186/1756-0500-2-80. Here is the webpage of 'NanoString
		nCounter' where you can find detailed information about this
		platform https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content
		/technology-overview/ncounter-technology. It has great clinical
		application, such as diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.
		Implements integrated system of random-coefficient hierarchical
		regression model to normalize data from 'NanoString nCounter'
		platform so that noise from various sources can be removed.
