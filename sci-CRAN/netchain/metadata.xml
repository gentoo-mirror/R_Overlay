		Inferring Causal Effects on Collective Outcomes under
		Interference // In networks, treatments may spill over from the
		treated individual to his or her social contacts and outcomes
		may be contagious over time. Under this setting, causal
		inference on the collective outcome observed over all network
		is often of interest. We use chain graph models approximating
		the projection of the full longitudinal data onto the observed
		data to identify the causal effect of the intervention on the
		whole outcome. Justification of such approximation is
		demonstrated in Ogburn et al. (2018) arXiv:1812.04990.
