		Transfer Learning with Regularized Generalized Linear Models //
		We provide an efficient implementation for two-step multi-
		source transfer learning algorithms in high-dimensional
		generalized linear models (GLMs). The elastic-net penalized GLM
		with three popular families, including linear, logistic and
		Poisson models, can be fitted. To avoid negative transfer, a
		transferable source detection algorithm is available. We also
		provides visualization for the transferable source detection
		results. A relevant paper by Ye Tian and Yang Feng (2021) will
		be available soon on arXiv.
