		Transfer Learning under Regularized Generalized Linear Models //
		We provide an efficient implementation for two-step multi-
		source transfer learning algorithms in high-dimensional
		generalized linear models (GLMs). The elastic-net penalized GLM
		with three popular families, including linear, logistic and
		Poisson regression models, can be fitted. To avoid negative
		transfer, a transferable source detection algorithm is
		proposed. We also provides visualization for the transferable
		source detection results. The relevant paper is available on
		arXiv: arXiv:2105.14328.
