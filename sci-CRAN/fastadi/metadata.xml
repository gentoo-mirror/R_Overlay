		Self-Tuning Data Adaptive Matrix Imputation // Implements the
		AdaptiveImpute matrix completion algorithm of 'Intelligent
		Initialization and Adaptive Thresholding for Iterative Matrix
		Completion' doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1518238 as well as the
		specialized variant of 'Co-Factor Analysis of Citation
		Networks' doi:10.1080/10618600.2024.2394464. AdaptiveImpute is
		useful for embedding sparsely observed matrices, often out
		performs competing matrix completion algorithms, and self-tunes
		its hyperparameter, making usage easy.
