		Self-Tuning Data Adaptive Matrix Imputation // Implements the
		AdaptiveImpute matrix completion algorithm of 'Intelligent
		Initialization and Adaptive Thresholding for Iterative Matrix
		Completion', https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/106
		18600.2018.1518238. AdaptiveImpute is useful for embedding
		sparsely observed matrices, often out performs competing matrix
		completion algorithms, and self-tunes its hyperparameter,
		making usage easy.
