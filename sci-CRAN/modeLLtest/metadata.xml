		Compare Models with Cross-Validated Log-Likelihood // An
		implementation of the cross-validated difference in means
		(CVDM) test by Desmarais and Harden (2014)
		doi:10.1007/s11135-013-9884-7 (see also Harden and Desmarais,
		2011 doi:10.1177/1532440011408929) and the cross-validated
		median fit (CVMF) test by Desmarais and Harden (2012)
		doi:10.1093/pan/mpr042. These tests use leave-one-out cross-
		validated log-likelihoods to assist in selecting among model
		estimations. You can also utilize data from Golder (2010)
		doi:10.1177/0010414009341714 and Joshi  Mason (2008)
		doi:10.1177/0022343308096155 that are included to facilitate
		examples from real-world analysis.
