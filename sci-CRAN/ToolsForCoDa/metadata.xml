		Multivariate Tools for Compositional Data Analysis // Provides
		functions for multivariate analysis with compositional data.
		Includes a function for doing compositional canonical
		correlation analysis.  This analysis requires two data matrices
		of compositions, which can be adequately transformed and used
		as entries in a specialized program for canonical correlation
		analysis, that is able to deal with singular covariance
		matrices. The methodology is described in Graffelman et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1101/144584. A function for log-ratio principal
		component analysis with condition number computations has been
		added to the package.
