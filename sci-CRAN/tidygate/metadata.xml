		Add Gate Information to Your Tibble // It interactively or
		programmatically label points within custom gates on two
		dimensions. The information is added to your tibble. It is
		based on the package 'gatepoints' from Wajid Jawaid (who is
		also author of this package). The code of gatepoints was nto
		integrated in tidygate. The benefits are (i) in interactive
		mode you can draw your gates on extensive 'ggplot'-like scatter
		plots; (ii) you can draw multiple gates; and (iii) you can save
		your gates and apply the programmatically.
