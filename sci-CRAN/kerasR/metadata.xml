		R Interface to the Keras Deep Learning Library // Provides a
		consistent interface to the 'Keras' Deep Learning Library
		directly from within R. 'Keras' provides specifications for
		describing dense neural networks, convolution neural networks
		(CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) running on top of
		either 'TensorFlow' or 'Theano'. Type conversions between
		Python and R are automatically handled correctly, even when the
		default choices would otherwise lead to errors. Includes
		complete R documentation and many working examples.
