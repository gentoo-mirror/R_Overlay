		Multivariate Estimates and Tests // Multivariate estimation and
		testing, currently a package for testing parametric data. To
		deal with parametric data, various multivariate normality tests
		and outlier detection are performed and visualized using the
		'ggplot2' package. Homogeneity tests for covariance matrices
		are also possible, as well as the Hotelling's T-square test and
		the multivariate analysis of variance test. We are exploring
		additional tests and visualization techniques, such as profile
		analysis and randomized complete block design, to be made
		available in the future and making them easily accessible to
		users.
