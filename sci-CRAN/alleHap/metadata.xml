		Allele Imputation and Haplotype Reconstruction from Pedigree
		Databases // Tools to simulate alphanumeric alleles, impute
		genetic missing data and reconstruct non-recombinant haplotypes
		from pedigree databases in a deterministic way. Allelic
		simulations can be implemented taking into account many factors
		(such as number of families, markers, alleles per marker,
		probability and proportion of missing genotypes, recombination
		rate, etc). Genotype imputation can be used with simulated
		datasets or real databases (previously loaded in .ped format).
		Haplotype reconstruction can be carried out even with missing
		data, since the program firstly imputes each family genotype
		(without a reference panel), to later reconstruct the
		corresponding haplotypes for each family member. All this
		considering that each individual (due to meiosis) should
		unequivocally have two alleles per marker (one inherited from
		each parent) and thus imputation and reconstruction results can
		be deterministically calculated.
