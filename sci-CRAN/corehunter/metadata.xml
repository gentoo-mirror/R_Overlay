		Multi-Purpose Core Subset Selection // Core Hunter is a tool to
		sample diverse, representative subsets from large germplasm
		collections, with minimum redundancy. Such so-called core
		collections have applications in plant breeding and genetic
		resource management in general. Core Hunter can construct cores
		based on genetic marker data, phenotypic traits or precomputed
		distance matrices, optimizing one of many provided evaluation
		measures depending on the precise purpose of the core (e.g.
		high diversity, representativeness, or allelic richness). In
		addition, multiple measures can be simultaneously optimized as
		part of a weighted index to bring the different perspectives
		closer together. The Core Hunter library is implemented in Java
		8 as an open source project (see http://www.corehunter.org).
