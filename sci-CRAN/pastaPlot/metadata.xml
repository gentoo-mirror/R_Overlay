		Spaghetti-Plot Fixed and Random Effects of Linear Mixed Models //
		Plot both fixed and random effects of linear mixed models,
		multilevel models in a single spaghetti plot. The package
		allows to visualize the effect of a predictor on a criterion
		between different levels of a grouping variable. Additionally,
		confidence intervals can be displayed for fixed effects.
		Calculation of predicted values of random effects allows only
		models with one random intercept and/or one random slope to be
		plotted. Confidence intervals and predicted values of fixed
		effects are computed using the 'ggpredict' function from the
		'ggeffects' package. Ldecke, D. (2018) doi:10.21105/joss.00638.
