		The Self-Consistent, Competing Risks (SC-CR) Algorithms // The
		SC-SR Algorithm is used to calculate fully non-parametric and
		self-consistent estimators of the cause-specific failure
		probabilities in the presence of interval-censoring and
		possible making of the failure cause in a competing risks
		environment. In the version 2.0 the function creating the
		probability matrix from double-censored data is added.
