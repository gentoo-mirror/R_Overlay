		group shape, precision, and accuracy. This includes graphical
		methods, descriptive statistics, and inference tests using
		standard, but also non-parametric and robust statistical
		methods. Implements distributions for radial error in bivariate
		normal variables. Works with files exported by 'OnTarget
		PC/TDS', 'Silver Mountain' e-target, 'ShotMarker' e-target, or
		'Taran', as well as with custom data files in text format.
		Supports inference from range statistics like extreme spread.
		Includes a set of web-based graphical user interfaces.
