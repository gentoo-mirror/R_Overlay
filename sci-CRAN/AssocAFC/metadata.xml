		Allele Frequency Comparison // When doing association analysis
		one does not always have the genotypes for the control
		population.  In such cases it may be necessary to fall back on
		frequency based tests using well known sources for the
		frequencies in the control population, for instance, from the
		1000 Genomes Project.  The Allele Frequency Comparison
		('AssocAFC') package performs multiple rare variant association
		analyses in both population and family-based GWAS (Genome-Wide
		Association Study) designs. It includes three score tests that
		are based on the difference of the sum of allele frequencies
		between cases and controls.  Two of these tests, Wcorrected()
		and Wqls(), are collapsing-based tests and suffer from having
		protective and risk variants. The third test, afcSKAT(), is a
		score test that overcomes the mix of SNP (Single-Nucleotide
		Polymorphism) effect directions. For more details see Saad M
		and Wijsman EM (2017) doi:10.1093/bib/bbx107.
