		Taxometric Analysis // We provide functions to perform taxometric
		analyses. This package contains 52 functions, but only 5 should
		be called directly by users. CheckData() should be run prior to
		any taxometric analysis to ensure that the data are appropriate
		for taxometric analysis. RunTaxometrics() performs taxometric
		analyses for a sample of data. RunCCFIProfile() performs a
		series of taxometric analyses to generate a CCFI profile.
		CreateData() generates a sample of categorical or dimensional
		data. ClassifyCases() assigns cases to groups using the base-
		rate classification method.
