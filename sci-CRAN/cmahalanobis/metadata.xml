		Calculate Distance Measures for DataFrames // It provides
		functions that calculate Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean
		distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev distance, Hamming
		distance, Canberra distance, Minkowski dissimilarity (distance
		defined for p = 1), Cosine dissimilarity, Bhattacharyya
		dissimilarity, Jaccard distance, Hellinger distance, Bray-
		Curtis dissimilarity, Sorensen-Dice dissimilarity between each
		pair of species in a list of data frames. These statistics are
		fundamental in various fields, such as cluster analysis,
		classification, and other applications of machine learning and
		data mining, where assessing similarity or dissimilarity
		between data is crucial. The package is designed to be flexible
		and easily integrated into data analysis workflows, providing
		reliable tools for evaluating distances in multidimensional
		contexts.
