		Calculate the Mahalanobis Distance for a Given List of Data
		Frames with Factors // It provides a function that calculates
		the Mahalanobis distance between each pair of species in a list
		of data frames. Each data frame contains the observations of a
		species with some factors. Mahalanobis distance is a measure of
		dissimilarity between two vectors of multivariate random
		variables, based on the covariance matrix. This distance is
		useful for statistical matching or fusion of data, that is the
		integration of two data sources that refer to the same target
		population and that share some variables. - "Fisher, R.A.
