		Calculate Distance Measures for a Given List of Data Frames with
		Factors // It provides functions that calculate Mahalanobis
		distance, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev
		distance, Hamming distance, Canberra distance, Minkowski
		distance, Cosine distance, Bhattacharyya distance, Jaccard
		distance, Hellinger distance, Bray-Curtis distance, Sorensen-
		Dice distance between each pair of species in a list of data
		frames. These metrics are fundamental in various fields, such
		as cluster analysis, classification, and other applications of
		machine learning and data mining, where assessing similarity or
		dissimilarity between data is crucial. The package is designed
		to be flexible and easily integrated into data analysis
		workflows, providing reliable tools for evaluating distances in
		multidimensional contexts.
