		Swiss Solvency Test (SST) Standard Models // Framework for the
		implementation of solvency related computations based on
		standard models for the Swiss Solvency Test (SST), a risk-based
		capital standard for Swiss insurance companies. Allows Monte
		Carlo simulation of market risk, some insurance risks and their
		aggregation. Additional toolbox for preprocessing computations.
		Convenient 'shiny' GUI combined with a parser for an input
		'excel' (.xlsx) template to simplify model configuration, data
		fill-in and results visualization.
