		'DataSHIELD' 'Tidyverse' Serverside Package // Implementation of
		selected 'Tidyverse' functions within 'DataSHIELD', an open-
		source federated analysis solution in R. Currently, DataSHIELD
		contains very limited tools for data manipulation, so the aim
		of this package is to improve the researcher experience by
		implementing essential functions for data manipulation,
		including subsetting, filtering, grouping, and renaming
		variables. For more information, see https://www.tidyverse.org/
		and https://datashield.org/.
