		Intelligent Predicting Response to Cancer Immunotherapy Through
		Systematic Modeling // Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer
		treatment, but predicting patient response remains challenging.
		Here, we presented Intelligent Predicting Response to cancer
		Immunotherapy through Systematic Modeling (iPRISM), a novel
		network-based model that integrates multiple data types to
		predict immunotherapy outcomes. It incorporates gene
		expression, biological functional network, tumor
		microenvironment characteristics, immune-related pathways, and
		clinical data to provide a comprehensive view of factors
		influencing immunotherapy efficacy. By identifying key genetic
		and immunological factors, it provides an insight for more
		personalized treatment strategies and combination therapies to
		overcome resistance mechanisms.
