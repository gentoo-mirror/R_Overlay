		Automatically Runs 36 Logistic Models (Individual and Ensembles)
		// Automatically returns 24 logistic models including 13
		individual models and 11 ensembles of models of logistic data.
		The package also returns 25 plots, 5 tables, and a summary
		report. The package automatically builds all 24 models, reports
		all results, and provides graphics to show how the models
		performed. This can be used for a wide range of data, such as
		sports or medical data. The package includes medical data (the
		Pima Indians data set), and information about the performance
		of Lebron James. The package can be used to analyze many other
		examples, such as stock market data. The package automatically
		returns many values for each model, such as True Positive Rate,
		True Negative Rate, False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate,
		Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, F1 Score,
		Area Under the Curve. The package also returns 36 Receiver
		Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each of the 24
		models.
