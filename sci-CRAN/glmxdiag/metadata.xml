		A Collection of Graphic Tools for GLM Diagnostics and some
		Extensions // Provides diagnostic graphic tools for GLMs, beta-
		binomial regression model (estimated by 'VGAM' package), beta
		regression model (estimated by 'betareg' package) and negative
		binomial regression model (estimated by 'MASS' package). Since
		most of functions implemented in 'glmxdiag' already exist in
		other packages, the aim is to provide the user unique functions
		that work on almost all regression models previously specified.
		Details about some of the implemented functions can be found in
		Brown (1992) doi:10.2307/2347617, Dunn and Smyth (1996)
