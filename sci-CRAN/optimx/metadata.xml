		Expanded Replacement and Extension of the 'optim' Function //
		Provides a replacement and extension of the optim() function to
		call to several function minimization codes in R in a single
		statement. These methods handle smooth, possibly box
		constrained functions of several or many parameters. Note that
		function 'optimr()' was prepared to simplify the incorporation
		of minimization codes going forward. Also implements some
		utility codes and some extra solvers, including safeguarded
		Newton methods. Many methods previously separate are now
		included here. This is the version for CRAN.
