		Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning Methods // The
		purpose of 'forecastML' is to simplify the process of multi-
		step-ahead direct forecasting with standard machine learning
		algorithms. 'forecastML' supports lagged, dynamic, static, and
		grouping features for modeling single and grouped time series.
		In addition, simple wrapper functions are used to support
		model-building with most R packages. This approach to
		forecasting is inspired by Bergmeir, Hyndman, and Koo's (2018)
		paper "A note on the validity of cross-validation for
		evaluating autoregressive time series prediction"
