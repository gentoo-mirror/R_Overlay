		Aggregating Trees // Aggregates a set of trees with the same
		leaves to create a consensus tree. The trees are typically
		obtained via hierarchical clustering, hence the hclust format
		is used to encode both the aggregated trees and the final
		consensus tree. The method is exact and proven to be
		O(nqlog(n)), n being the individuals and q being the number of
		trees to aggregate.
