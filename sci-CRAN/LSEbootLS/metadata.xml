		Bootstrap Methods for Regression Models with Locally Stationary
		Errors // Implements bootstrap methods for linear regression
		models with errors following a time-varying process, focusing
		on approximating the distribution of the least-squares
		estimator for regression models with locally stationary errors.
		It enables the construction of bootstrap and classical
		confidence intervals for regression coefficients, leveraging
		intensive simulation studies and real data analysis.
