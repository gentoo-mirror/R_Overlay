		Creates Pseudo-Observations and Analysis for Recurrent Event Data
		// Computation of one-, two- and three-dimensional pseudo-
		observations based on recurrent events and terminal events.
		Generalised linear models are fitted using generalised
		estimating equations. Technical details on the bivariate
		procedure can be found in "Bivariate pseudo-observations for
		recurrent event analysis with terminal events" (Furberg et al.,
		2021) doi:10.1007/s10985-021-09533-5.
