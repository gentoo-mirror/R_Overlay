		Quick Multivariate Graphs // Functions used for graphing in
		multivariate contexts. These functions are designed to support
		produce reasonable graphs with minimal input of graphing
		parameters. The motivation for these functions was to support
		students learning multivariate concepts and R - there may be
		other functions and packages better-suited to practical data
		analysis. For details about the ellipse methods see Johnson and
		Wichern (2007, ISBN:9780131877153).
