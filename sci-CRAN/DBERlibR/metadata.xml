		Automated Assessment Data Analysis for Discipline-Based Education
		Research // Discipline-Based Education Research scientists
		repeatedly analyze assessment data to ensure question items
		reliability and examine the efficacy of a new educational
		intervention. Analyzing assessment data comprises multiple
		steps and statistical techniques that consume much of
		researchers time and are error-prone. While education research
		continues to grow across many disciplines of science,
		technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the
		discipline-based education research community lacks tools to
		streamline education research data analysis. DBERlibRan R
		package to streamline and automate assessment data processing
		and analysisfills this gap. The package reads user-provided
		assessment data, cleans them, merges multiple datasets (as
		necessary), checks assumption(s) for specific statistical
		techniques (as necessary), applies various statistical tests
		(e.g., one-way analysis of covariance, one-way repeated-
		measures analysis of variance), and presents and interprets the
		results all at once. By providing the most frequently used
		analytic techniques, this package will contribute to education
		research by facilitating the creation and widespread use of
		evidence-based knowledge and practices. The outputs contain a
		sample interpretation of the results for users convenience.
		User inputs are minimal; they only need to prepare the data
		files as instructed and type a function in the 'R' console to
		conduct a specific data analysis.\n For descriptions of the
		statistical methods employed in package, refer to the following
