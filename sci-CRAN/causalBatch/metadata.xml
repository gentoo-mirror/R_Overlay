		Causal Batch Effects // Software which provides numerous
		functionalities for detecting and removing group-level effects
		from high-dimensional scientific data which, when combined with
		additional assumptions, allow for causal conclusions, as-
		described in our manuscripts Bridgeford et al. (2024)
		doi:10.1101/2021.09.03.458920 and Bridgeford et al. (2023)
		arXiv:2307.13868. Also provides a number of useful utilities
		for generating simulations and balancing covariates across
		multiple groups/batches of data via matching and propensity
		trimming for more than two groups.
