		Covariate-Adjusted Adaptive Randomization via Mahalanobis-
		Distance // In randomized controlled trial (RCT), balancing
		covariate is often one of the most important concern. CARM
		package provides functions to balance the covariates and
		generate allocation sequence by covariate-adjusted Adaptive
		Randomization via Mahalanobis-distance (ARM) for RCT. About
		what ARM is and how it works please see Y. Qin, Y. Li, W. Ma,
		H. Yang, and F. Hu (2022). "Adaptive randomization via
		Mahalanobis distance" Statistica Sinica.
		doi:10.5705/ss.202020.0440. In addition, the package is also
		suitable for the randomization process of multi-arm trials. For
		details, please see Yang H, Qin Y, Wang F, et al. (2023).
