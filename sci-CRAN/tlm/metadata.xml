		Effects under Linear, Logistic and Poisson Regression Models with
		Transformed Variables // Computation of effects under linear,
		logistic and Poisson regression models with transformed
		variables. Logarithm and power transformations are allowed.
		Effects can be displayed both numerically and graphically in
		both the original and the transformed space of the variables.
		The methods are described in Barrera-Gomez and Basagana (2015)
		doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000247.
