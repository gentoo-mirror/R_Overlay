		A Code Generator for ODE-Based Models // Provides an R6 class and
		several utility methods to facilitate the implementation of
		models based on ordinary differential equations. The heart of
		the package is a code generator that creates compiled 'Fortran'
		(or 'R') code which can be passed to a numerical solver. There
		is direct support for solvers contained in packages 'deSolve'
		and 'rootSolve'.
