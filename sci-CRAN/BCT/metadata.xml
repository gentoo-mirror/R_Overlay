		Bayesian Context Trees for Discrete Time Series // An
		implementation of a collection of tools for exact Bayesian
		inference with discrete times series. This package contains
		functions that can be used for prediction, model selection,
		estimation, and other statistical tasks. Specifically, the
		functions provided can be used for the exact computation of the
		prior predictive likelihood of the data, for the identification
		of the a posteriori most likely (MAP) variable-memory Markov
		models, for calculating the exact posterior probabilities and
		the AIC and BIC scores of these models, and for prediction with
		respect to log-loss and 0-1 loss. All the functions here
		(except generate_data) are implementations of deterministic
		algorithms that have linear complexity in the length of the
		input data. Example data sets from finance, genetics and animal
		communication are also provided. Detailed descriptions of the
		underlying theory and algorithms can be found in [Kontoyiannis
		et al. 'Bayesian Context Trees: Modelling and exact inference
		for discrete time series.' arXiv:2007.14900 [stat.ME], July
		2020].
