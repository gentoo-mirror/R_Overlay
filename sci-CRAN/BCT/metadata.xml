		Bayesian Context Trees for Discrete Time Series // An
		implementation of a collection of tools for exact Bayesian
		inference with discrete times series. This package contains
		functions that can be used for prediction, model selection,
		estimation, segmentation/change-point detection and other
		statistical tasks. Specifically, the functions provided can be
		used for the exact computation of the prior predictive
		likelihood of the data, for the identification of the a
		posteriori most likely (MAP) variable-memory Markov models, for
		calculating the exact posterior probabilities and the AIC and
		BIC scores of these models, for prediction with respect to log-
		loss and 0-1 loss and segmentation/change-point detection.
		Example data sets from finance, genetics, animal communication
		and meteorology are also provided. Detailed descriptions of the
		underlying theory and algorithms can be found in [Kontoyiannis
		et al. 'Bayesian Context Trees: Modelling and exact inference
		for discrete time series.' Journal of the Royal Statistical
		Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology), April 2022.
		Available at: arXiv:2007.14900 [stat.ME], July 2020] and [Lungu
		et al. 'Change-point Detection and Segmentation of Discrete
		Data using Bayesian Context Trees' arXiv:2203.04341 [stat.ME],
