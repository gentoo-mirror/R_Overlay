		Early Detection of Public Health Threats from Twitter Data // It
		allows you to automatically monitor trends of tweets by time,
		place and topic aiming at detecting public health threats early
		through the detection of signals (e.g. an unusual increase in
		the number of tweets). It was designed to focus on infectious
		diseases, and it can be extended to all hazards or other fields
		of study by modifying the topics and keywords.
