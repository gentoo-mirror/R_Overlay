		Blending and Compositing Algebra for 'ggplot2' // Algebra of
		operations for blending, copying, adjusting, and compositing
		layers in 'ggplot2'. Supports copying and adjusting the
		aesthetics or parameters of an existing layer, partitioning a
		layer into multiple pieces for re-composition, applying affine
		transformations to layers, and combining layers (or partitions
		of layers) using blend modes (including commutative blend
		modes, like multiply and darken). Blend mode support is
		particularly useful for creating plots with overlapping groups
		where the layer drawing order does not change the output; see
		Kindlmann and Scheidegger (2014) doi:10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346325.
