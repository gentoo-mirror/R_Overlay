		Multivariate Analysis Using Biplots in R // Several multivariate
		techniques from a biplot perspective. It is the translation
		(with many improvements) into R of the previous package
		developed in 'Matlab'. The package contains some of the main
		developments of my team during the last 30 years together with
		some more standard techniques. Package includes: Classical
		Biplots, HJ-Biplot, Canonical Biplots, MANOVA Biplots,
		Correspondence Analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis,
		Canonical STATIS-ACT, Logistic Biplots for binary and ordinal
		data, Multidimensional Unfolding, External Biplots for
		Principal Coordinates Analysis or Multidimensional Scaling,
		among many others. References can be found in the help of each
		procedure.
