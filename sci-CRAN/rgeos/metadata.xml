		Interface to Geometry Engine - Open Source ('GEOS') // Interface
		to Geometry Engine - Open Source ('GEOS') using the C 'API' for
		topology operations on geometries. Please note that 'rgeos'
		will be retired during October 2023, plan transition to 'sf' or
		'terra' functions using 'GEOS', or the 'geos' package, at your
		earliest convenience (see
		https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html and earlier
		blogs for guidance). The 'GEOS' library is external to the
		package, and, when installing the package from source, must be
		correctly installed first. Windows and Mac Intel OS X binaries
		are provided on 'CRAN'. ('rgeos' = 0.5-1): Up to and including
		'GEOS' 3.7.1, topological operations succeeded with some
		invalid geometries for which the same operations fail from and
		including 'GEOS' 3.7.2. The 'checkValidity=' argument defaults
		and structure have been changed, from default FALSE to integer
		default '0L' for 'GEOS'  3.7.2 (no check), '1L' 'GEOS' = 3.7.2
		(check and warn). A value of '2L' is also provided that may be
		used, assigned globally using 'set_RGEOS_CheckValidity(2L)', or
		locally using the 'checkValidity=2L' argument, to attempt zero-
		width buffer repair if invalid geometries are found. The
		previous default (FALSE, now '0L') is fastest and used for
		'GEOS'  3.7.2, but will not warn users of possible problems
		before the failure of topological operations that previously
		succeeded. From 'GEOS' 3.8.0, repair of geometries may also be
		attempted using 'gMakeValid()', which may, however, return a
		collection of geometries of different types.
