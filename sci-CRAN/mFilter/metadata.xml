		Miscellaneous Time Series Filters // The mFilter package
		implements several time series filters useful for smoothing and
		extracting trend and cyclical components of a time series. The
		routines are commonly used in economics and finance, however
		they should also be interest to other areas. Currently,
		Christiano-Fitzgerald, Baxter-King, Hodrick-Prescott,
		Butterworth, and trigonometric regression filters are included
		in the package.
