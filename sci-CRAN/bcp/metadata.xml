		Bayesian Analysis of Change Point Problems // Provides an
		implementation of the Barry and Hartigan (1993) product
		partition model for the normal errors change point problem
		using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. It also extends the methodology
		to regression models on a connected graph (Wang and Emerson,
		2015); this allows estimation of change point models with
		multivariate responses. Parallel MCMC, previously available in
		bcp v.3.0.0, is currently not implemented.
