		Programming with Big Data -- Interface to Parallel Unidata
		NetCDF4 Format Data Files // This package adds collective
		parallel read and write capability to the R package ncdf4
		version 1.8. Typical use is as a parallel NetCDF4 file reader
		in SPMD style programming. Each R process reads and writes its
		own data in a synchronized collective mode, resulting in faster
		parallel performance. Performance improvement is conditional on
		a parallel file system.
