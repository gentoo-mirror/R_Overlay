		Resampling Methods for Triangular and Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers
		// The classical (i.e. Efron's, see Efron and Tibshirani (1994,
		ISBN:978-0412042317)  "An Introduction to the Bootstrap")
		bootstrap is widely used for both the real (i.e. "crisp") and
		fuzzy data. The main aim of the algorithms implemented in this
		package  is to overcome a problem with repetition of a few
		distinct values and to create fuzzy numbers, which are
		"similar" (but not the same) to values from the initial sample.
		To do this, different characteristics of triangular/trapezoidal
		numbers are kept (like the value, the ambiguity, etc., see
		Grzegorzewski et al. doi:10.2991/eusflat-19.2019.68,
		Grzegorzewski et al. (2020) doi:10.2991/ijcis.d.201012.003,
		Grzegorzewski et al. (2020) doi:10.34768/amcs-2020-0022,
		Romaniuk and Hryniewicz (2019) doi:10.1007/s00500-018-3251-5).
		Some additional procedures related to these resampling methods
		are also provided, like calculation of the Bertoluzza et al.'s
		distance (aka the mid/spread distance, see Bertoluzza et al.
		(1995) "On a new class of distances between fuzzy numbers") and
		estimation of the p-value of the one-sample bootstrapped test
		for the mean (see Lubiano et al. (2016,
		doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2015.11.016)). Additionally, there are
		procedures which randomly generate trapezoidal fuzzy numbers
		using some well-known statistical distributions.
