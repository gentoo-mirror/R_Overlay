		R Client for 'iRODS' // The open sourced data management software
		'Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System' ('iRODS') offers
		solutions for the whole data life cycle (https://irods.org/).
		The loosely constructed and highly configurable architecture of
		'iRODS' frees the user from strict formatting constraints and
		single-vendor solutions. This package provides an interface to
		the 'iRODS' REST API, allowing you to manage your data and
		metadata in 'iRODS' with R. Storage of annotated files and R
		objects in 'iRODS' ensures findability, accessibility,
		interoperability, and reusability of data.
