		A Collection of Techniques Correcting for Sample Selection Bias
		// A collection of various techniques correcting statistical
		models for sample selection bias is provided. In particular,
		the resampling-based methods "stochastic inverse-probability
		oversampling" and "parametric inverse-probability bagging" are
		placed at the disposal which generate synthetic observations
		for correcting classifiers for biased samples resulting from
		stratified random sampling. For further information, see the
		article Krautenbacher, Theis, and Fuchs (2017)
		doi:10.1155/2017/7847531. The methods may be used for further
		purposes where weighting and generation of new observations is
		needed.
