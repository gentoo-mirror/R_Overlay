		Create Phantom Variables in Structural Equation Models for
		Sensitivity Analyses // Create phantom variables, which are
		variables that were not observed, for the purpose of
		sensitivity analyses for structural equation models. The
		package makes it easier for a user to test different
		combinations of covariances between the phantom variable(s) and
		observed variables. The package may be used to assess a model's
		or effect's sensitivity to temporal bias (e.g., if cross-
		sectional data were collected) or confounding bias.
