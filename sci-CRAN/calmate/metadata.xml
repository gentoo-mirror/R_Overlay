		Improved Allele-Specific Copy Number of SNP Microarrays for
		Downstream Segmentation // The CalMaTe method calibrates
		preprocessed allele-specific copy number estimates (ASCNs) from
		DNA microarrays by controlling for single-nucleotide
		polymorphism-specific allelic crosstalk. The resulting ASCNs
		are on average more accurate, which increases the power of
		segmentation methods for detecting changes between copy number
		states in tumor studies including copy neutral loss of
		heterozygosity. CalMaTe applies to any ASCNs regardless of
		preprocessing method and microarray technology, e.g. Affymetrix
		and Illumina.
