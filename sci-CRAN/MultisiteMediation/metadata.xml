		Causal Mediation Analysis in Multisite Trials // Multisite causal
		mediation analysis using the methods proposed by Qin and Hong
		(2017) doi:10.3102/1076998617694879, Qin, Hong, Deutsch, and
		Bein (2019) doi:10.1111/rssa.12446, and Qin, Deutsch, and Hong
		(2021) doi:10.1002/pam.22268. It enables causal mediation
		analysis in multisite trials, in which individuals are assigned
		to a treatment or a control group at each site. It allows for
		estimation and hypothesis testing for not only the population
		average but also the between-site variance of direct and
		indirect effects transmitted through one single mediator or two
		concurrent (conditionally independent) mediators. This strategy
		conveniently relaxes the assumption of no treatment-by-mediator
		interaction while greatly simplifying the outcome model
		specification without invoking strong distributional
		assumptions. This package also provides a function that can
		further incorporate a sample weight and a nonresponse weight
		for multisite causal mediation analysis in the presence of
		complex sample and survey designs and non-random nonresponse,
		to enhance both the internal validity and external validity.
		The package also provides a weighting-based balance checking
		function for assessing the remaining overt bias.
