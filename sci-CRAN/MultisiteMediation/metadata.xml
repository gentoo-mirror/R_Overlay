		Causal Mediation Analysis in Multisite Trials // We implement
		multisite causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed
		by Qin and Hong (2017) doi:10.3102/1076998617694879 and Qin,
		Hong, Deutsch, and Bein (under review). It enables causal
		mediation analysis in multisite trials, in which individuals
		are assigned to a treatment or a control group at each site. It
		allows for estimation and hypothesis testing for not only the
		population average but also the between-site variance of direct
		and indirect effects. This strategy conveniently relaxes the
		assumption of no treatment-by-mediator interaction while
		greatly simplifying the outcome model specification without
		invoking strong distributional assumptions. This package also
		provides a function that can further incorporate a sample
		weight and a nonresponse weight for multisite causal mediation
		analysis in the presence of complex sample and survey designs
		and non-random nonresponse, to enhance both the internal
		validity and external validity. Because the identification
		assumptions are not always warranted, the package also provides
		a weighting-based balance checking function for assessing the
		remaining overt bias, as well as a weighting-based sensitivity
		analysis function for further evaluating the potential bias
		related to omitted confounding or to propensity score model
		misspecification.
