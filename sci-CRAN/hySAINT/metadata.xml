		Hybrid Genetic and Simulated Annealing for Variable Selection //
		We provide a stage-wise selection method using genetic
		algorithms, designed to efficiently identify main and two-way
		interactions within high-dimensional linear regression models.
		Additionally, it implements simulated annealing algorithms
		during the mutation process. The relevant paper can be found
		at: Ye, C.,and Yang,Y. (2019) doi:10.1109/TIT.2019.2913417.
