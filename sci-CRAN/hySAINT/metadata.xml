		Hybrid Genetic and Simulated Annealing Algorithm for High
		Dimensional Linear Models with Interaction Effects // We
		provide a stage-wise selection method using genetic algorithms,
		designed to efficiently identify main and two-way interactions
		within high-dimensional linear regression models. Additionally,
		it implements simulated annealing algorithm during the mutation
		process. The relevant paper can be found at: Ye, C.,and Yang,Y.
