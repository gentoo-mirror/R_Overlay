		Tools for Normalizing and Comparing ChIP-seq Samples // Chromatin
		immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing
		(ChIP-seq) is the premier technology for profiling genome-wide
		localization of chromatin-binding proteins, including
		transcription factors and histones with various modifications.
		This package provides a robust method for normalizing ChIP-seq
		signals across individual samples or groups of samples. It also
		designs a self-contained system of statistical models for
		calling differential ChIP-seq signals between two or more
		biological conditions as well as for calling hypervariable
		ChIP-seq signals across samples. Refer to Tu et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1101/gr.262675.120 and Chen et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1101/2021.07.27.453915 for associated statistical
		details.
