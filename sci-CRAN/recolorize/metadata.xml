		Color-Based Image Segmentation // Automatic, semi-automatic, and
		manual functions for generating color maps from images. The
		idea is to simplify the colors of an image according to a
		metric that is useful for the user, using deterministic methods
		whenever possible. Many images will be clustered well using the
		out-of-the-box functions, but the package also includes a
		toolbox of functions for making manual adjustments (layer
		merging/isolation, blurring, fitting to provided color clusters
		or those from another image, etc). Also includes export methods
		for other color/pattern analysis packages (pavo, patternize,
		colordistance).
