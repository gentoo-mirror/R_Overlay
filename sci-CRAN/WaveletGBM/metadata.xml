		Wavelet Based Gradient Boosting Method // Wavelet decomposition
		method is very useful for modelling noisy time series data.
		Wavelet decomposition using 'haar' algorithm has been
		implemented to developed hybrid Wavelet GBM (Gradient Boosting
		Method) model for time series forecasting using algorithm by
		Anjoy and Paul (2017) DOI:10.1007/s00521-017-3289-9.
