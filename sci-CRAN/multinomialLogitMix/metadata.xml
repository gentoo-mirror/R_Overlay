		Clustering Multinomial Count Data under the Presence of
		Covariates // Methods for model-based clustering of multinomial
		counts under the presence of covariates using mixtures of
		multinomial logit models, as implemented in Papastamoulis
		(2023) DOI:10.1007/s11634-023-00547-5. These models are
		estimated under  a frequentist as well as a Bayesian setup
		using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and Markov chain
		Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC), respectively. The (unknown) number
		of clusters is selected according to the Integrated Completed
		Likelihood criterion (for the frequentist model), and
		estimating the number of non-empty components using overfitting
		mixture models after imposing suitable sparse prior assumptions
		on the mixing proportions (in the Bayesian case), see Rousseau
		and Mengersen (2011) DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00781.x. In
		the latter case, various MCMC chains run in parallel and are
		allowed to switch states. The final MCMC output is suitably
		post-processed in order to undo label switching using the
		Equivalence Classes Representatives (ECR) algorithm, as
		described in Papastamoulis (2016) DOI:10.18637/jss.v069.c01.
