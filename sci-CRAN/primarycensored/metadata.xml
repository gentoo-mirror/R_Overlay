		Primary Event Censored Distributions // Provides functions for
		working with primary event censored distributions and 'Stan'
		implementations for use in Bayesian modeling. Primary event
		censored distributions are useful for modeling delayed
		reporting scenarios in epidemiology and other fields (Charniga
		et al. (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2405.08841). It also provides
		support for arbitrary delay distributions, a range of common
		primary distributions, and allows for truncation and secondary
		event censoring to be accounted for (Park et al. (2024)
		doi:10.1101/2024.01.12.24301247). A subset of common
		distributions also have analytical solutions implemented,
		allowing for faster computation. In addition, it provides
		multiple methods for fitting primary event censored
		distributions to data via optional dependencies.
