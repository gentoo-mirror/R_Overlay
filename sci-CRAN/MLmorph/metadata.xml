		Integrating Morphological Modeling and Machine Learning for
		Decision Support // Integrating morphological modeling with
		machine learning to support structured decision-making (e.g.,
		in management and consulting). The package enumerates a
		morphospace of feasible configurations and uses random forests
		to estimate class probabilities over that space, bridging
		deductive model exploration with empirical validation. It
		includes utilities for factorizing inputs, model training,
		morphospace construction, and an interactive 'shiny' app for
		scenario exploration.
