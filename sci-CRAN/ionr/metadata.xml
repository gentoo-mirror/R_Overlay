		Test for Indifference of Indicator // Provides item exclusion
		procedure, which is a formal method to test 'Indifference Of
		iNdicator' (ION). When a latent personality trait-outcome
		association is assumed, then the association strength should
		not depend on which subset of indicators (i.e. items) has been
		chosen to reflect the trait. Personality traits are  often
		measured (reflected) by  a sum-score of a certain set of
		indicators. Item exclusion procedure randomly excludes items
		from a sum-score and tests, whether the sum-score - outcome
		correlation changes. ION has been achieved, when any item can
		be excluded from the sum-score without the sum-score - outcome
		correlation substantially changing . For more details, see
		Vainik, Mottus et. al, (2015) "Are Trait-Outcome Associations
		Caused by Scales or Particular Items? Example Analysis of
		Personality Facets and BMI",European Journal of Personality
		DOI: 10.1002/per.2009 .
