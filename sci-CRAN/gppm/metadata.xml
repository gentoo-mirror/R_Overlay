		Gaussian Process Panel Modeling // Provides an implementation of
		Gaussian process panel modeling (GPPM). GPPM is described in
		Karch, Brandmaier  Voelkle (2020; DOI:10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00351)
		and Karch (2016; DOI:10.18452/17641). Essentially, GPPM is
		Gaussian process based modeling of longitudinal panel data.
		'gppm' also supports regular Gaussian process regression (with
		a focus on flexible model specification), and multi-task
		learning.
