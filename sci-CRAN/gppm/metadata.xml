		Gaussian Process Panel Modeling // Provides an implementation of
		Gaussian process panel modeling (GPPM). GPPM is described in
		Karch (2016; DOI:10.18452/17641) and Karch, Brandmaier  Voelkle
		(2018; DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/KVW5Y). Essentially, GPPM is
		Gaussian process based modeling of longitudinal panel data.
		'gppm' also supports regular Gaussian process regression (with
		a focus on flexible model specification), and multi-task
		learning.
