		Robust Test for Complete Independence in High-Dimensions // Test
		Statistics for Independence in High-Dimensional Datasets. This
		package consists of two functions to perform the complete
		independence test based on test statistics proposed by Bulut
		(unpublished yet) and suggested by Najarzadeh (2021) doi:
		10.1080/03610926.2019.1702699. The Bulut's statistic is not
		sensitive to outliers in high-dimensional data, unlike one of
		Najarzadeh (2021) doi: 10.1080/03610926.2019.1702699. So, the
		Bulut's statistic can be performed robustly by using RDnp
		function.
