		Analysis of Accelerated Destructive Degradation Test Data //
		Accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDT) are often used
		to collect necessary data for assessing the long-term
		properties of polymeric materials. Based on the collected data,
		a thermal index (TI) is estimated. The TI can be useful for
		material rating and comparison. This package implements the
		traditional method based on the least-squares method, the
		parametric method based on maximum likelihood estimation, and
		the semiparametric method based on spline methods, and the
		corresponding methods for estimating TI for polymeric
		materials. The traditional approach is a two-step approach that
		is currently used in industrial standards, while the parametric
		method is widely used in the statistical literature. The
		semiparametric method is newly developed. Both the parametric
		and semiparametric approaches allow one to do statistical
		inference such as quantifying uncertainties in estimation,
		hypothesis testing, and predictions. Publicly available
		datasets are provided illustrations. More details can be found
		in Jin et al. (2017).
