		Tools and Methods for Working with MIDFIELD Data in 'R' //
		Provides tools and demonstrates methods for working with
		individual undergraduate student-level records (registrar's
		data) in 'R'. Tools include filters for program codes, data
		sufficiency, and timely completion. Methods include gathering
		blocs of records, computing quantitative metrics such as
		graduation rate, and creating charts to visualize comparisons.
		'midfieldr' interacts with practice data provided in
		'midfielddata', an R data package available at
		https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/. 'midfieldr' also
		interacts with the full MIDFIELD database for users who have
		access. This work is supported by the US National Science
		Foundation through grant numbers 1545667 and 2142087.
