		Unified Cross-Omics Deconvolution // UNIfied Cross-Omics
		deconvolution (Unico) deconvolves standard 2-dimensional bulk
		matrices of samples by features into a 3-dimensional tensors
		representing samples by features by cell types. Unico stands
		out as the first principled model-based deconvolution method
		that is theoretically justified for any heterogeneous genomic
		data. For more details see Chen and Rahmani et al. (2024)
