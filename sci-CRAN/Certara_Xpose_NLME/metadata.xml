		Enhances 'xpose' Diagnostics for Pharmacometric Models from
		'Certara.RsNLME' and Phoenix NLME // Facilitates the creation
		of 'xpose' data objects from Nonlinear Mixed Effects (NLME)
		model outputs produced by 'Certara.RsNLME' or Phoenix NLME.
		This integration enables users to utilize all 'ggplot2'-based
		plotting functions available in 'xpose' for thorough model
		diagnostics and data visualization. Additionally, the package
		introduces specialized plotting functions tailored for
		covariate model evaluation, extending the analytical
		capabilities beyond those offered by 'xpose' alone.
