		Combine Multiple GWAS by Using Gene-Environment Interactions //
		Classical methods for combining summary data from genome-wide
		association studies (GWAS) only use marginal genetic effects
		and power can be compromised in the presence of heterogeneity.
		'subgxe' is a R package that implements p-value assisted subset
		testing for association (pASTA), a method developed by Yu et
		al. (2019) doi:10.1159/000496867. pASTA generalizes association
		analysis based on subsets by incorporating gene-environment
		interactions into the testing procedure.
