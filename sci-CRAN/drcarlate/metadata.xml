		Improving Estimation Efficiency in CAR with Imperfect Compliance
		// We provide a list of functions for replicating the results
		of the Monte Carlo simulations and empirical application of
		Jiang et al. (2022). In particular, we provide corresponding
		functions for generating the three types of random data
		described in this paper, as well as all the estimation
		strategies. Detailed information about the data generation
		process and estimation strategy can be found in Jiang et al.
