		Gaussian Mixture Model for Multi-Omics Data Integration // A
		multivariate Gaussian mixture model framework to integrate
		multiple types of genomic data and allow modeling of inter-
		data-type correlations for association analysis. 'IMIX' can be
		implemented to test whether a disease is associated with genes
		in multiple genomic data types, such as DNA methylation, copy
		number variation, gene expression, etc. It can also study the
		integration of multiple pathways. 'IMIX' uses the summary
		statistics of association test outputs and conduct integration
		analysis for two or three types of genomics data. 'IMIX'
		features statistically-principled model selection, global FDR
		control and computational efficiency. Details are described in
		Ziqiao Wang and Peng Wei (2020)
