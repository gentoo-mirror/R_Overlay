		Remote Sensing Field Work Tools // In remote sensing, designing a
		field campaign to collect ground-truth data can be a
		challenging task. We need to collect representative samples
		while accounting for issues such as budget constraints and
		limited accessibility created by e.g. poor infrastructure. As
		suggested by Olofsson et al. (2014)
		doi:10.1016/j.rse.2014.02.015, this demands the establishment
		of best-practices to collect ground-truth data that avoid the
		waste of time and funds. 'fieldRS' addresses this issue by
		helping scientists and practitioners design field campaigns
		through the identification of priority sampling sites, the
		extraction of potential sampling plots and the conversion of
		plots into consistent training and validation samples that can
		be used in e.g. land cover classification.
