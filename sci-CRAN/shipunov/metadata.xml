		Miscellaneous Functions from Alexey Shipunov // A collection of
		functions for data manipulation, plotting and statistical
		computing, to use separately or with the book "Visual
		Statistics. Use R!": Shipunov (2019)
		http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/software/r/r-en.htm. Most useful
		functions are probably Bclust(), Jclust() and BootA() which
		bootstrap hierarchical clustering; Recode() which does multiple
		recoding in a fast, flexible and simple way; Misclass() which
		outputs confusion matrix even if classes are not concerted;
		Overlap() which calculates overlaps of convex hulls from any
		projection; Biarrows() which converts any scatterplot into
		biplot, and Pleiad() which is fast and flexible correlogram.
		There are much more useful functions, please see documentation.
