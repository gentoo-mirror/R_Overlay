		Miscellaneous Functions from Alexey Shipunov // A collection of
		functions for data manipulation, plotting and statistical
		computing, to use separately or with the book "Visual
		Statistics. Use R!": Shipunov (2020)
		http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/software/r/r-en.htm. Most useful
		functions: Bclust(), Jclust() and BootA() which bootstrap
		hierarchical clustering; Recode() which does multiple recoding
		in a fast, simple and flexible way; Misclass() which outputs
		confusion matrix even if classes are not concerted; Overlap()
		which measures group separation on any projection; Biarrows()
		which converts any scatterplot into biplot; and Pleiad() which
		is fast and flexible correlogram.
