		Vegetation Indices (VIs) Calculation for Remote Sensing Analysis
		// It provides a comprehensive toolkit for calculating a suite
		of common vegetation indices (VIs) derived from remote sensing
		imagery. VIs are essential tools used to quantify vegetation
		characteristics, such as biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and
		photosynthetic activity, which are essential parameters in
		various ecological, agricultural, and environmental studies.
		Applications of this package include biomass estimation, crop
		monitoring, forest management, land use and land cover change
		analysis and climate change studies. For method details see,
		Deb,D.,Deb,S.,Chakraborty,D.,Singh,J.P.,Singh,A.K.,Dutta,P.and
		Choudhury,A.(2020)doi:10.1080/10106049.2020.1756461. Utilizing
		this R package, users can effectively extract and analyze
		critical information from remote sensing imagery, enhancing
		their comprehension of vegetation dynamics and their importance
		in global ecosystems. The package includes the function
		vegetation_indices().
