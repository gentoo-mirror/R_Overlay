		Modelling Traditional Life Insurance Contracts // R6 classes to
		model traditional life insurance contracts like annuities,
		whole life insurances or endowments. Such life insurance
		contracts provide a guaranteed interest and are not directly
		linked to the performance of a particular investment vehicle,
		but they typically provide (discretionary) profit
		participation. This package provides a framework to model such
		contracts in a very generic (cash-flow-based) way and includes
		modelling profit participation schemes, dynamic increases or
		more general contract layers, as well as contract changes (like
		sum increases or premium waivers). All relevant quantities like
		premium decomposition, reserves and benefits over the whole
		contract period are calculated and potentially exported to
		'Excel'. Mortality rates are given using the 'MortalityTables'
		package.
