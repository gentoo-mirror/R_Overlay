		Create Meme // The word 'Meme' was originated from the book, 'The
		Selfish Gene', authored by Richard Dawkins (1976). It is a unit
		of culture that is passed from one generation to another and
		correlates to the gene, the unit of physical heredity. The
		internet memes are captioned photos that are intended to be
		funny, ridiculous. Memes behave like infectious viruses and
		travel from person to person quickly through social media. The
		'meme' package allows users to make custom memes.
