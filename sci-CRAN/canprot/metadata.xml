		Chemical Composition of Differential Protein Expression //
		Datasets are collected here for differentially (up- and down-)
		expressed proteins identified in proteomic studies of cancer
		and in cell culture experiments. Tables of amino acid
		compositions of proteins are used for calculations of chemical
		composition, projected into selected basis species. Plotting
		functions are used to visualize the compositional differences
		and thermodynamic potentials for proteomic transformations.
