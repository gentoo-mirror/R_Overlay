		Chemical Metrics of Differentially Expressed Proteins // Chemical
		metrics of differentially expressed proteins in cancer and cell
		culture proteomics experiments. Data files in the package have
		amino acid compositions of proteins obtained from UniProt and
		250 published lists of up- and down-regulated proteins in
		different cancer types and laboratory experiments. Functions
		are provided to calculate chemical metrics including protein
		length, grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), isoelectric
		point (pI), carbon oxidation state, and stoichiometric
		hydration state; the latter two are described in Dick et al.
		(2020) doi:10.5194/bg-17-6145-2020. The vignettes visualize
		differences of chemical metrics between up- and down-regulated
		proteins and list literature references for all datasets.
