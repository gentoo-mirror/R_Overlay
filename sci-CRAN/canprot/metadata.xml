		Chemical Analysis of Proteins // Chemical analysis of proteins
		based on their amino acid compositions. Amino acid compositions
		can be read from FASTA files and used to calculate chemical
		metrics including carbon oxidation state and stoichiometric
		hydration state, as described in Dick et al. (2020)
		doi:10.5194/bg-17-6145-2020. Other properties that can be
		calculated include protein length, grand average of hydropathy
		(GRAVY), isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight (MW),
		standard molal volume (V0), and metabolic costs (Akashi and
		Gojobori, 2002 doi:10.1073/pnas.062526999; Wagner, 2005
		doi:10.1093/molbev/msi126; Zhang et al., 2018
		doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06461-1). A database of amino acid
		compositions of human proteins derived from UniProt is
		provided.
