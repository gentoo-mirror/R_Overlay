		Compositional Analysis of Differentially Expressed Proteins in
		Cancer // Compositional analysis of differentially expressed
		proteins in cancer and cell culture proteomics experiments. The
		data include lists of up- and down-regulated proteins in
		different cancer types (breast, colorectal, liver, lung,
		pancreatic, prostate) and laboratory conditions (hypoxia,
		hyperosmotic stress, high glucose, 3D cell culture, and
		proteins secreted in hypoxia), together with amino acid
		compositions computed for protein sequences obtained from
		UniProt. Functions are provided to calculate compositional
		metrics including protein length, carbon oxidation state, and
		stoichiometric hydration state. In addition, phylostrata
		(evolutionary ages) of protein-coding genes are compiled using
		data from Liebeskind et al. (2016) doi:10.1093/gbe/evw113 or
		Trigos et al. (2017) doi:10.1073/pnas.1617743114. The vignettes
		contain plots of compositional differences, phylostrata for
		human proteins, and references for all datasets.
