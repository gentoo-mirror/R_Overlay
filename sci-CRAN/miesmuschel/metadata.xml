		Mixed Integer Evolution Strategies // Evolutionary black box
		optimization algorithms building on the 'bbotk' package.
		'miesmuschel' offers both ready-to-use optimization algorithms,
		as well as their fundamental building blocks that can be used
		to manually construct specialized optimization loops. The Mixed
		Integer Evolution Strategies as described by Li et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1162/EVCO_a_00059 can be implemented, as well as the
		multi-objective optimization algorithms NSGA-II by Deb, Pratap,
		Agarwal, and Meyarivan (2002) doi:10.1109/4235.996017.
