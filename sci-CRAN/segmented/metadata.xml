		Regression Models with Break-Points / Change-Points Estimation
		(with Possibly Random Effects) // Fitting regression models
		where, in addition to possible linear terms, one or more
		covariates have segmented (i.e., broken-line or piece-wise
		linear) or stepmented (i.e. piece-wise constant) effects.
		Multiple breakpoints for the same variable are allowed. The
		estimation method is discussed in Muggeo (2003,
		doi:10.1002/sim.1545) and illustrated in Muggeo (2008,
		https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-1.pdf). An
		approach for hypothesis testing is presented in Muggeo (2016,
		doi:10.1080/00949655.2016.1149855), and interval estimation for
		the breakpoint is discussed in Muggeo (2017,
		doi:10.1111/anzs.12200). Segmented mixed models, i.e. random
		effects in the change point, are discussed in Muggeo (2014,
		doi:10.1177/1471082X13504721). Estimation of piecewise-constant
		relationships and changepoints (mean-shift models) is discussed
		in Fasola et al. (2018, doi:10.1007/s00180-017-0740-4).
