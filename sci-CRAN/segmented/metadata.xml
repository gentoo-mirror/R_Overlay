		Regression Models with Break-Points / Change-Points Estimation //
		Given a regression model, segmented `updates' it by adding one
		or more segmented (i.e., piece-wise linear) relationships.
		Several variables with multiple breakpoints are allowed. The
		estimation method is discussed in Muggeo (2003,
		doi:10.1002/sim.1545) and illustrated in Muggeo (2008,
		https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-1.pdf). An
		approach for hypothesis testing is presented in Muggeo (2016,
		doi:10.1080/00949655.2016.1149855).
