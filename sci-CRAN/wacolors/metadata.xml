		Colorblind-Friendly Palettes from Washington State // Color
		palettes taken from the landscapes and cities of Washington
		state. Colors were extracted from a set of photographs, and
		then combined to form a set of continuous and discrete
		palettes.  Continuous palettes were designed to be perceptually
		uniform, while discrete palettes were chosen to maximize
		contrast at several different levels of overall brightness and
		saturation. Each palette has been evaluated to ensure colors
		are distinguishable by colorblind people.
