		Computation of Bayes Factors for Common Biomedical Designs //
		BAYesian inference for MEDical designs in R. Functions for the
		computation of Bayes factors for common biomedical research
		designs. Implemented are functions to test the equivalence
		(equiv_bf), non-inferiority (infer_bf), and superiority
		(super_bf) of an experimental group compared to a control group
		on a continuous outcome measure. Bayes factors for these three
		tests can be computed based on raw data (x, y) or summary
		statistics (n_x, n_y, mean_x, mean_y, sd_x, sd_y [or ci_margin
		and ci_level]).
