		Sample Variance Plots (Sv-Plots) // Two versions of sample
		variance plots, Sv-plot1 and Sv-plot2, will be provided
		illustrating the squared deviations from sample variance.
		Besides indicating the contribution of squared deviations for
		the sample variability, these plots are capable of detecting
		characteristics of the distribution such as symmetry, skewness
		and outliers. A remarkable graphical method based on Sv-plot2
		can determine the decision on testing hypotheses over one or
		two population means. In sum, Sv-plots will be appealing
		visualization tools. Complete description of this methodology
		can be found in the article, Wijesuriya (2020)
