		Selecting Variable Subsets // A collection of functions which (i)
		assess the quality of variable subsets as surrogates for a full
		data set, in either an exploratory data analysis or in the
		context of a multivariate linear model, and (ii) search for
		subsets which are optimal under various criteria. Theoretical
		support for the heuristic search methods and exploratory data
		analysis criteria is in Cadima, Cerdeira, Minhoto (2003,
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2003.11.001). Theoretical support for the
		leap and bounds algorithm and the criteria for the general
		multivariate linear model is in Duarte Silva (2001,
		doi:10.1006/jmva.2000.1920). There is a package vignette
		"subselect", which includes additional references.
