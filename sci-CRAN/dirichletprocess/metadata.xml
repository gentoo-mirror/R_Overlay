		Build Dirichlet Process Objects for Bayesian Modelling // Perform
		nonparametric Bayesian analysis using Dirichlet processes
		without the need to program the inference algorithms. Utilise
		included pre-built models or specify custom models and allow
		the 'dirichletprocess' package to handle the Markov chain Monte
		Carlo sampling. Our Dirichlet process objects can act as
		building blocks for a variety of statistical models including
		and not limited to: density estimation, clustering and prior
		distributions in hierarchical models. See Teh, Y. W. (2011)
		https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/research/npbayes/Teh2010a.pdf,
		among many other sources.
