		Spatial Resampling Infrastructure // Functions and classes for
		spatial resampling to use with the 'rsample' package, such as
		spatial cross-validation (Brenning, 2012)
		doi:10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352393. The scope of 'rsample' and
		'spatialsample' is to provide the basic building blocks for
		creating and analyzing resamples of a spatial data set, but
		neither package includes functions for modeling or computing
		statistics. The resampled spatial data sets created by
		'spatialsample' do not contain much overhead in memory.
