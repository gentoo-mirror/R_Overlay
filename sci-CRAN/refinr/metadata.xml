		Cluster and Merge Similar Values Within a Character Vector //
		These functions take a character vector as input, identify and
		cluster similar values, and then merge clusters together so
		their values become identical. The functions are an
		implementation of the key collision and ngram fingerprint
		algorithms from the open source tool Open Refine
		https://openrefine.org/. More info on key collision and ngram
		fingerprint can be found here
		https://openrefine.org/docs/technical-reference/clustering-in-
		depth.
