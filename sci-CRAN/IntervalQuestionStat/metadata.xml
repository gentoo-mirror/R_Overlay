		Tools to Deal with Interval-Valued Responses in Questionnaires //
		A user-friendly toolbox for doing the statistical analysis of
		interval-valued responses in questionnaires measuring
		intrinsically imprecise human attributes or features
		(attitudes, perceptions, opinions, feelings, etc.). In
		particular, this package provides S4 classes, methods, and
		functions in order to compute basic arithmetic and statistical
		operations with interval-valued data; prepare customized plots;
		associate each interval-valued response to its equivalent
		Likert-type and visual analogue scales answers through the
		minimum theta-distance and the mid-point criteria; analyze the
		reliability of respondents' answers from the internal
		consistency point of view by means of Cronbach's alpha
		coefficient; and simulate interval-valued responses in this
		type of questionnaires. The package also incorporates some
		real-life data that can be used to illustrate its working with
		several non-trivial reproducible examples. The methodology used
		in this package is based in many theoretical and applied
		publications from SMIRE+CoDiRE (Statistical Methods with
		Imprecise Random Elements and Comparison of Distributions of
		Random Elements) Research Group
		(https://bellman.ciencias.uniovi.es/smire+codire/) from the
		University of Oviedo (Spain).
