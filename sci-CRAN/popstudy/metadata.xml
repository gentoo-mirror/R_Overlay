		Applied Techniques to Demographic and Time Series Analysis // The
		use of overparameterization is proposed with combinatorial
		analysis to test a broader spectrum of possible ARIMA models.
		In the selection of ARIMA models, the most traditional methods
		such as correlograms or others, do not usually cover many
		alternatives to define the number of coefficients to be
		estimated in the model, which represents an estimation method
		that is not the best. The popstudy package contains several
		tools for statistical analysis in demography and time series
		based in Shryock research (Shryock et. al. (1980)
		https://books.google.co.cr/books?id=8Oo6AQAAMAAJ).
