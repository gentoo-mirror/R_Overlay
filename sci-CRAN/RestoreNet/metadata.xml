		Random-Effects Stochastic Reaction Networks // A random-effects
		stochastic model that allows quick detection of clonal
		dominance events from clonal tracking data collected in gene
		therapy studies. Starting from the Ito-type equation describing
		the dynamics of cells duplication, death and differentiation at
		clonal level, we first considered its local linear
		approximation as the base model. The parameters of the base
		model, which are inferred using a maximum likelihood approach,
		are assumed to be shared across the clones. Although this
		assumption makes inference easier, in some cases it can be too
		restrictive and does not take into account possible scenarios
		of clonal dominance. Therefore we extended the base model by
		introducing random effects for the clones. In this extended
		formulation the dynamic parameters are estimated using a
		tailor-made expectation maximization algorithm. Further details
		on the methods can be found in L. Del Core et al., (2022)
