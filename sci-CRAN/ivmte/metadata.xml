		Instrumental Variables: Extrapolation by Marginal Treatment
		Effects // The marginal treatment effect was introduced by
		Heckman and Vytlacil (2005)
		doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2005.00594.x to provide a choice-
		theoretic interpretation to instrumental variables models that
		maintain the monotonicity condition of Imbens and Angrist
		(1994) doi:10.2307/2951620. This interpretation can be used to
		extrapolate from the compliers to estimate treatment effects
		for other subpopulations. This package provides a flexible set
		of methods for conducting this extrapolation. It allows for
		parametric or nonparametric sieve estimation, and allows the
		user to maintain shape restrictions such as monotonicity. The
		package operates in the general framework developed by Mogstad,
		Santos and Torgovitsky (2018) doi:10.3982/ECTA15463, and
		accommodates either point identification or partial
		identification (bounds). In the partially identified case,
		bounds are computed using either linear programming or
		quadratically constrained quadratic programming. Support for
		four solvers is provided. Gurobi and the Gurobi R API can be
		obtained from http://www.gurobi.com/index. CPLEX can be
		obtained from https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer.
		CPLEX R APIs 'Rcplex' and 'cplexAPI' are available from CRAN.
		MOSEK and the MOSEK R API can be obtained from
		https://www.mosek.com/. The lp_solve library is freely
		available from http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/, and is
		included when installing its API 'lpSolveAPI', which is
		available from CRAN.
