		Linear Regressions with a Latent Outcome Variable // Fit linear
		models, estimating score distributions for groups of people,
		following Cohen and Jiang (1999) doi:10.2307/2669917. In this
		model, the response is a latent trait (such as student ability)
		and raw item responses are combined with item difficulties in
		an item response theory (IRT) framework to form a density for
		each unit (student). This latent trait is then integrated out.
		This software is intended to fit the same models as the
		existing software 'AM' http://am.air.org/.
