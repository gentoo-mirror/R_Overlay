		Linear Regressions with a Latent Outcome Variable // Fit latent
		variable linear models, estimating score distributions for
		groups of people, following Cohen and Jiang (1999)
		doi:10.2307/2669917. In this model, a latent distribution is
		conditional on students item response, item characteristics,
		and conditioning variables the user includes. This latent trait
		is then integrated out. This software is intended to fit the
		same models as the existing software 'AM' https://am.air.org/.
		As of version 2, also allows the user to draw plausible values.
