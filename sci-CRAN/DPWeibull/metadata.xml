		Dirichlet Process Weibull Mixture Model for Survival Data // Use
		Dirichlet process Weibull mixture model and dependent Dirichlet
		process Weibull mixture model for survival data with and
		without competing risks. Dirichlet process Weibull mixture
		model is used for data without covariates and dependent
		Dirichlet process model is used for regression data. The
		package is designed to handle exact/right-censored/ interval-
		censored observations without competing risks and exact/right-
		censored observations for data with competing risks. Inside
		each cluster of Dirichlet process, we assume a multiplicative
		effect of covariates as in Cox model and Fine and Gray model.
		In addition, we provide a wrapper for DPdensity() function from
		the R package 'DPpackage'. This wrapper automatically uses Low
		Information Omnibus prior and can model one and two dimensional
		data with Dirichlet mixture of Gaussian distributions.
