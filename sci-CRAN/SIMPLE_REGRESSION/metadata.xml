		OLS, Moderated, Logistic, and Count Regressions Made Simple //
		Provides SPSS- and SAS-like output for least squares multiple
		regression, logistic regression, and count variable
		regressions. Detailed output is also provided for OLS moderated
		regression, interaction plots, and Johnson-Neyman regions of
		significance. The output includes standardized coefficients,
		partial and semi-partial correlations, collinearity
		diagnostics, plots of residuals, and detailed information about
		simple slopes for interactions. The output for some functions
		includes Bayes Factors and, if requested, regression
		coefficients from Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses.
		There are numerous options for model plots. The
		REGIONS_OF_SIGNIFICANCE function also provides Johnson-Neyman
		regions of significance and plots of interactions for both lm
		and lme models. There is also a function for partial and
		semipartial correlations and a function for conducting Cohen's
		set correlation analyses.
