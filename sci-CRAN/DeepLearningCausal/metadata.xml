		Causal Inference with Super Learner and Deep Neural Networks //
		Functions to estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects
		(CATE) and Population Average Treatment Effects on the Treated
		(PATT) from experimental or observational data using the Super
		Learner (SL) ensemble method and Deep neural networks. The
		package first provides functions to implement meta-learners
		such as the Single-learner (S-learner) and Two-learner
		(T-learner) described in KCnzel et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.1804597116 for estimating the CATE. The S- and
		T-learner are each estimated using the SL ensemble method and
		deep neural networks. It then provides functions to implement
		the Ottoboni and Poulos (2020) doi:10.1515/jci-2018-0035
		PATT-C estimator to obtain the PATT from experimental data with
		noncompliance by using the SL ensemble method and deep neural
		networks.
