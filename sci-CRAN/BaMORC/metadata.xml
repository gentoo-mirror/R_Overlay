		Bayesian Model Optimized Reference Correction Method for Assigned
		and Unassigned Protein NMR Spectra // Provides reference
		correction for protein NMR spectra. Bayesian Model Optimized
		Reference Correction (BaMORC) is utilizing Bayesian
		probabilistic framework to perform protein NMR referencing
		correction, currently for alpha and beta carbon-13 chemical
		shifts, without any resonance assignment and/or three-
		dimensional protein structure. For more detailed explanation,
		please refer to the paper "Automatic 13C Chemical Shift
		Reference Correction for Unassigned Protein NMR Spectra"
		https://rdcu.be/4ly5 (Journal of Biomolecular NMR, Aug 2018)"
		doi:10.1007/s10858-018-0202-5.
