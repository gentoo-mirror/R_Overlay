		Coercion Methods for Simplicial Complex Data Structures //
		Computational topology, which includes topological data
		analysis (TDA), makes pervasive use of abstract mathematical
		objects called simplicial complexes; see Edelsbrunner and Harer
		(2010) doi:10.1090/mbk/069. Several R packages and other
		software libraries used through an R interface construct and
		use data structures that represent simplicial complexes,
		including mathematical graphs viewed as 1-dimensional
		complexes. This package provides coercers (converters) between
		these data structures. Currently supported structures are
		complete lists of simplices as used by 'TDA'; the simplex trees
		of Boissonnat and Maria (2014) doi:10.1007/s00453-014-9887-3 as
		implemented in 'simplextree' and in Python GUDHI (by way of
		'reticulate'); and the graph classes of 'igraph' and 'network',
		by way of the 'intergraph' package.
