		Sum of Single Effects Linear Regression // Implements methods for
		variable selection in linear regression based on the "Sum of
		Single Effects" (SuSiE) model, as described in Wang et al
		(2020) DOI:10.1101/501114. These methods provide simple
		summaries, called "Credible Sets", for accurately quantifying
		uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The methods
		are motivated by genetic fine-mapping applications, and are
		particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly
		correlated and detectable effects are sparse. The fitting
		algorithm, a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods
		called "Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection" (IBSS), is
		simple and fast, allowing the SuSiE model be fit to large data
		sets (thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of
		variables).
