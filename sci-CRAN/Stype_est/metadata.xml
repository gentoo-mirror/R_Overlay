		S-Type Estimators // Implements the S-type estimators, novel
		robust estimators for general linear regression models,
		addressing challenges such as outlier contamination and
		leverage points. This package introduces robust regression
		techniques to provide a robust alternative to classical methods
		and includes diagnostic tools for assessing model fit and
		performance. The methodology is based on the study, "Comparison
		of the Robust Methods in the General Linear Regression Model"
		by Sazak and Mutlu (2023). This package is designed for
		statisticians and applied researchers seeking advanced tools
		for robust regression analysis.
