		Zero-Inflated Models (ZIM) for Count Time Series with Excess
		Zeros // Analyze count time series with excess zeros. Two types
		of statistical models are supported: Markov regression by Yang
		et al. (2013) doi:10.1016/j.stamet.2013.02.001 and state-space
		models by Yang et al. (2015) doi:10.1177/1471082X14535530. They
		are also known as observation-driven and parameter-driven
		models respectively in the time series literature. The
		functions used for Markov regression or observation-driven
		models can also be used to fit ordinary regression models with
		independent data under the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) or zero-
		inflated negative binomial (ZINB) assumption. Besides, the
		package contains some miscellaneous functions to compute
		density, distribution, quantile, and generate random numbers
		from ZIP and ZINB distributions.
