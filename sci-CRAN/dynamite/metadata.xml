		Bayesian Modeling and Causal Inference for Multivariate
		Longitudinal Data // Easy-to-use and efficient interface for
		Bayesian inference of complex panel (time series) data using
		dynamic multivariate panel models by Helske and Tikka (2022)
		doi:10.31235/osf.io/mdwu5. The package supports joint modeling
		of multiple measurements per individual, time-varying and time-
		invariant effects, and a wide range of discrete and continuous
		distributions. Estimation of these dynamic multivariate panel
		models is carried out via 'Stan'.
