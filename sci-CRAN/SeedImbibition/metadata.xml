		Seed Imbibition Percentage // Imbibition causes seeds to expand,
		which results in the seed coat or testa being broken. Seed
		germination begins with imbibition. Imbibition aids in the
		transport of water into the developing ovules. Imbibition is
		required during the first stages of root water absorption.
