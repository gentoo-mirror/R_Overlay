		Temporal and Spatio-Temporal Modeling and Monitoring of Epidemic
		Phenomena // Statistical methods for the modeling and
		monitoring of time series of counts, proportions and
		categorical data, as well as for the modeling of continuous-
		time point processes of epidemic phenomena. The monitoring
		methods focus on aberration detection in count data time series
		from public health surveillance of communicable diseases, but
		applications could just as well originate from environmetrics,
		reliability engineering, econometrics, or social sciences. The
		package implements many typical outbreak detection procedures
		such as the (improved) Farrington algorithm, or the negative
		binomial GLR-CUSUM method of Hoehle and Paul (2008)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.015. A novel CUSUM approach
		combining logistic and multinomial logistic modeling is also
		included. The package contains several real-world data sets,
		the ability to simulate outbreak data, and to visualize the
		results of the monitoring in a temporal, spatial or spatio-
		temporal fashion. A recent overview of the available monitoring
		procedures is given by Salmon et al. (2016)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10. For the retrospective analysis of
		epidemic spread, the package provides three endemic-epidemic
		modeling frameworks with tools for visualization, likelihood
		inference, and simulation. hhh4() estimates models for
		(multivariate) count time series following Paul and Held (2011)
		doi:10.1002/sim.4177 and Meyer and Held (2014)
		doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743. twinSIR() models the susceptible-
		infectious-recovered (SIR) event history of a fixed population,
		e.g, epidemics across farms or networks, as a multivariate
		point process as proposed by Hoehle (2009)
		doi:10.1002/bimj.200900050. twinstim() estimates self-exciting
		point process models for a spatio-temporal point pattern of
		infective events, e.g., time-stamped geo-referenced
		surveillance data, as proposed by Meyer et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01684.x. A recent overview of the
		implemented space-time modeling frameworks for epidemic
		phenomena is given by Meyer et al. (2017)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i11.
