		Crunch.io Data Tools // The Crunch.io service (http://crunch.io/)
		provides a cloud-based data store and analytic engine, as well
		as an intuitive web interface. Using this package, analysts can
		interact with and manipulate Crunch datasets from within R.
		Importantly, this allows technical researchers to collaborate
		naturally with team members, managers, and clients who prefer a
		point-and-click interface.
