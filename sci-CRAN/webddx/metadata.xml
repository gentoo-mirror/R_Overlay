		Interact with Online Differential Diagnosis-Generating Tools //
		Freely available online differential-diagnosis generating tools
		are changing clinical medicine and biomedical research. With
		webddx, useRs can generate differential diagnosis lists given a
		set of symptoms. The web tools would likely be directly used in
		clinical practice, but programmatic interaction and data
		manipulation can sharply increase efficiency and
		reproducibility of research in clinical informatics. Relevant
		visualizations can also be created with webddx.
