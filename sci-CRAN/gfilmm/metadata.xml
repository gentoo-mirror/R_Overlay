		Generalized Fiducial Inference for Normal Linear Mixed Models //
		Simulation of the generalized fiducial distribution for normal
		linear mixed models with interval data. Fiducial inference is
		somehow similar to Bayesian inference, in the sense that it is
		based on a distribution that represents the uncertainty about
		the parameters, like the posterior distribution in Bayesian
		statistics. It does not require a prior distribution, and it
		yields results close to frequentist results. Reference:
		Cisewski and Hannig (2012) doi:10.1214/12-AOS1030.
