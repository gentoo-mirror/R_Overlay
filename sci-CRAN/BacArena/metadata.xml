		Modeling Framework for Cellular Communities in their Environments
		// Can be used for simulation of organisms living in
		communities (Bauer and Zimmermann (2017)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005544). Each organism is represented
		individually and genome scale metabolic models determine the
		uptake and release of compounds. Biological processes such as
		movement, diffusion, chemotaxis and kinetics are available
		along with data analysis techniques.
