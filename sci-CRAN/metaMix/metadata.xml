		Bayesian Mixture Analysis for Metagenomic Community Profiling //
		Resolves complex metagenomic mixtures by analysing deep
		sequencing data, using a mixture model based approach. The use
		of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of
		the species space enables the identification of the set of
		species more likely to contribute to the mixture.
