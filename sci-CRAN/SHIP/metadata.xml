		Shrinkage Covariance Incorporating Prior Knowledge // Implements
		estimation methods for shrinkage covariance matrices using
		user-specified covariance targets. The covariance target is a
		structured matrix towards which the unbiased sample covariance
		is shrunk, optionally incorporating prior knowledge. Shrinkage
		intensity is computed analytically. The method is described and
		applied to microarray gene expression data in Jelizarow et al.
