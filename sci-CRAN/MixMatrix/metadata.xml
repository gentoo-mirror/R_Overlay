		Classification with Matrix Variate Normal and t Distributions //
		Provides sampling and density functions for matrix variate
		normal, t, and inverted t distributions;  ML estimation for
		matrix variate normal and t distributions using the EM
		algorithm, including some restrictions on the parameters; and
		classification by linear and quadratic discriminant analysis
		for matrix variate normal and t distributions described in
		Thompson et al. (2019) arXiv:1907.09565. Performs clustering
		with matrix variate normal and t mixture models.
