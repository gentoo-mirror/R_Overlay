		Triangle Meshes and Related Geometry Tools // Generate planar and
		spherical triangle meshes, compute finite element calculations
		for 1- and 2-dimensional flat and curved manifolds with
		associated basis function spaces, methods for lines and
		polygons, and transparent handling of coordinate reference
		systems and coordinate transformation, including 'sf' and 'sp'
		geometries. The core 'fmesher' library code was originally part
		of the 'INLA' package, and implements parts of "Triangulations
		and Applications" by Hjelle and Daehlen (2006)
