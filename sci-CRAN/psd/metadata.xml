		Adaptive, Sine-Multitaper Power Spectral Density and Cross
		Spectrum Estimation // Produces power spectral density
		estimates through iterative refinement of the optimal number of
		sine-tapers at each frequency. This optimization procedure is
		based on the method of Riedel and Sidorenko (1995), which
		minimizes the Mean Square Error (sum of variance and bias) at
		each frequency, but modified for computational stability. The
		same procedure can now be used to calculate the cross spectrum
		(multivariate analyses).
