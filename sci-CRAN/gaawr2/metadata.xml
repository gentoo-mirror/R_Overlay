		Genetic Association Analysis // It gathers information, meta-data
		and scripts in a two-part Henry-Stewart talk by Zhao (2009,
		doi:10.69645/DCRY5578), which showcases analysis in aspects
		such as testing of polymorphic variant(s) for Hardy-Weinberg
		equilibrium, association with trait using genetic and
		statistical models as well as Bayesian implementation, power
		calculation in study design and genetic annotation. It also
		covers R integration with the Linux environment, GitHub,
		package creation and web applications.
