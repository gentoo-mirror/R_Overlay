		Early Warning System // The purpose of Early Warning Systems
		(EWS) is to detect accurately the occurrence of a crisis, which
		is represented by a binary variable which takes the value of
		one when the event occurs, and the value of zero otherwise. EWS
		are a toolbox for policymakers to prevent or attenuate the
		impact of economic downturns. Modern EWS are based on the
		econometric framework of Kauppi and Saikkonen (2008)
		doi:10.1162/rest.90.4.777. Specifically, this framework
		includes four dichotomous models, relying on a logit approach
		to model the relationship between yield spreads and future
		recessions, controlling for recession risk factors. These
		models can be estimated in a univariate or a balanced panel
		framework as in Candelon, Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2014)
		doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.03.015. This package provides
		both methods for estimating these models and a dataset covering
		13 OECD countries over a period of 45 years. In addition, this
		package also provides methods for the analysis of the
		propagation mechanisms of an exogenous shock, as well as robust
		confidence intervals for these response functions using a
		block-bootstrap method as in Lajaunie (2021). This package
		constitutes a useful toolbox (data and functions) for scholars
		as well as policymakers.
