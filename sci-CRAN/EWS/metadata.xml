		Early Warning System // Early Warning Systems (EWS) are a toolbox
		for policymakers to prevent or attenuate the impact of economic
		downturns. Modern EWS are based on the econometric framework of
		Kauppi and Saikkonen (2008) doi:10.1162/rest.90.4.777.
		Specifically, this framework includes four dichotomous models,
		relying on a logit approach to model the relationship between
		yield spreads and future recessions, controlling for recession
		risk factors. These models can be estimated in a univariate or
		a balanced panel framework as in Candelon, Dumitrescu and
		Hurlin (2014) doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.03.015. This
		package provides both methods for estimating these models and a
		dataset covering 13 OECD countries over a period of 45 years.
		This package constitutes a useful toolbox (data and functions)
		for scholars as well as policymakers.
