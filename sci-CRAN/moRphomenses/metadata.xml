		Geometric Morphometric Tools to Align, Scale, and Compare "Shape"
		of Menstrual Cycle Hormones // Mitteroecker  Gunz (2009)
		doi:10.1007/s11692-009-9055-x describe how geometric
		morphometric methods allow researchers to quantify the size and
		shape of physical biological structures. We provide tools to
		extend geometric morphometric principles to the study of non-
		physical structures, hormone profiles, as outlined in Ehrlich
		et al (2021) doi:10.1002/ajpa.24514. Easily transform daily
		measures into multivariate landmark-based data. Includes custom
		functions to apply multivariate methods for data exploration as
		well as hypothesis testing. Also includes 'shiny' web app to
		streamline data exploration. Developed to study menstrual cycle
		hormones but functions have been generalized and should be
		applicable to any biomarker over any time period.
