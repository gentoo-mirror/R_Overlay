		Fitting Linear and Generalized Linear Models in "Divide and
		Recombine" Approach to Large Data Sets // To overcome the
		memory limitations for fitting linear (LM) and Generalized
		Linear Models (GLMs) to large data sets, this package
		implements the Divide and Recombine (DR) strategy. It basically
		divides the entire large data set into suitable subsets
		manageable in size and then fits model to each subset. Finally,
		results from each subset are aggregated to obtain the final
		estimate. This package also supports fitting GLMs to data sets
		that cannot fit into memory and provides methods for fitting
		GLMs under linear regression, binomial regression, Poisson
		regression, and multinomial logistic regression settings.
		Respective models are fitted using different DR strategies as
		described by: Xi, Lin, and Chen (2009)
