		Adaptive Sum of Powered Score Test // R codes for the (adaptive)
		Sum of Powered Score ('SPU' and 'aSPU') tests, inverse variance
		weighted Sum of Powered score ('SPUw' and 'aSPUw') tests and
		gene-based and some pathway based association tests (Pathway
		based Sum of Powered Score tests ('SPUpath'), adaptive
		'SPUpath' ('aSPUpath') test, 'GEEaSPU' test for multiple traits
		- single 'SNP' (single nucleotide polymorphism) association in
		generalized estimation equations, 'MTaSPUs' test for multiple
		traits - single 'SNP' association with Genome Wide Association
		Studies ('GWAS') summary statistics, Gene-based Association
		Test that uses an extended 'Simes' procedure ('GATES'), Hybrid
		Set-based Test ('HYST') and extended version of 'GATES' test
		for pathway-based association testing ('GATES-Simes'). ). The
		tests can be used with genetic and other data sets with
		covariates. The response variable is binary or quantitative.
		Summary; (1) Single trait-'SNP' set association with
		individual-level data ('aSPU', 'aSPUw', 'aSPUr'), (2) Single
		trait-'SNP' set association with summary statistics ('aSPUs'),
		(3) Single trait-pathway association with individual-level data
		('aSPUpath'), (4) Single trait-pathway association with summary
		statistics ('aSPUsPath'), (5) Multiple traits-single 'SNP'
		association with individual-level data ('GEEaSPU'), (6)
		Multiple traits- single 'SNP' association with summary
		statistics ('MTaSPUs'), (7) Multiple traits-'SNP' set
		association with summary statistics('MTaSPUsSet'), (8) Multiple
