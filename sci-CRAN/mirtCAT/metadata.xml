		Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Item Response
		Theory // Provides tools to generate an HTML interface for
		creating adaptive and non-adaptive educational and
		psychological tests using the shiny package (Chalmers (2016)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v071.i05). Suitable for applying
		unidimensional and multidimensional computerized adaptive tests
		(CAT) using item response theory methodology and for creating
		simple questionnaires forms to collect response data directly
		in R. Additionally, optimal test designs (e.g., "shadow
		testing") are supported for tests which contain a large number
		of item selection constraints. Finally, package contains tools
		useful for performing Monte Carlo simulations for studying the
		behavior of computerized adaptive test banks.
