		Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Item Response
		Theory // Provides tools to generate HTML interfaces for
		adaptive and non-adaptive tests using the shiny package
		(Chalmers (2016) doi:10.18637/jss.v071.i05). Suitable for
		applying unidimensional and multidimensional computerized
		adaptive tests (CAT) using item response theory methodology and
		for creating simple questionnaires forms to collect response
		data directly in R. Additionally, optimal test designs (e.g.,
		"shadow testing") are supported for tests that contain a large
		number of item selection constraints. Finally, package contains
		tools useful for performing Monte Carlo simulations for
		studying test item banks.
