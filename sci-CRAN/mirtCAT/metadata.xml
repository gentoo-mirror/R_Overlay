		Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Item Response
		Theory // Provides tools to generate an HTML interface for
		creating adaptive and non-adaptive educational and
		psychological tests using the shiny package. Suitable for
		applying unidimensional and multidimensional computerized
		adaptive tests (CAT) using item response theory methodology and
		for creating simple questionnaires forms to collect response
		data directly in R. Additionally, optimal test designs (e.g.,
		"shadow testing") are supported for tests which contain a large
		number of item selection constraints. Finally, package contains
		tools useful for performing Monte Carlo simulations for
		studying the behavior of computerized adaptive test banks.
