		Tools for Discrete Multivariate Mixed Membership Models // Fits
		mixed membership models with discrete multivariate data (with
		or without repeated measures) following the general framework
		of Erosheva et al (2004). This package uses a Variational EM
		approach by approximating the posterior distribution of latent
		memberships and selecting hyperparameters through a pseudo-MLE
		procedure. Currently supported data types are Bernoulli,
		multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce). The extended GoM model
		with fixed stayers from Erosheva et al (2007) is now also
		supported. See Airoldi et al (2014) for other examples of mixed
		membership models.
