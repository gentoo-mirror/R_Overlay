		Search Tagged Peptides  Draw Highlighted Mass Spectra // In a
		typical protein labelling procedure, proteins are chemically
		tagged with a functional group, usually at specific sites, then
		digested into peptides, which are then analyzed using matrix-
		assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass
		spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to generate peptide fingerprint.
		Relative to the control, peptides that are heavier by the mass
		of the labelling group are informative for sequence
		determination. Searching for peptides with such mass shifts,
		however, can be difficult. This package, designed to tackle
		this inconvenience, takes as input the mass list of two or
		multiple MALDI-TOF MS mass lists, and makes pairwise
		comparisons between the labeled groups vs. control, and
		restores centroid mass spectra with highlighted peaks of
		interest for easier visual examination. Particularly, peaks
		differentiated by the mass of the labelling group are defined
		as a pair, those with equal masses as a match, and all the
		other peaks as a mismatch.For more bioanalytical background
		information, refer to following publications: Jingjing Deng
