		High-Dimensional Robust Factor Analysis // Factor models have
		been widely applied in areas such as economics and finance, and
		the well-known heavy-tailedness of macroeconomic/financial data
		should be taken into account when conducting factor analysis.
		We propose two algorithms to do robust factor analysis by
		considering the Huber loss. One is based on minimizing the
		Huber loss of the idiosyncratic error's L2 norm, which turns
		out to do Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the weighted
		sample covariance matrix and thereby named as Huber PCA. The
		other one is based on minimizing the element-wise Huber loss,
		which can be solved by an iterative Huber regression algorithm.
		In this package we also provide the code for traditional PCA,
		the Robust Two Step (RTS) method by He et al. (2022) and the
		Quantile Factor Analysis (QFA) method by Chen et al. (2021) and
		He et al. (2023).
