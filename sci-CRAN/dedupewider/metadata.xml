		Deduplication Across Multiple Columns // Duplicated data can
		exist in different rows and columns and user may need to treat
		observations (rows) connected by duplicated data as one
		observation, e.g. companies can belong to one family (and thus:
		be one company) by sharing some telephone numbers. This package
		provides a function to find connected rows based on data on
		chosen columns and collapse it into one row.
