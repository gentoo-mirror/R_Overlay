		About some Small Functions // The solution to some common
		problems is proposed, as well as a summary of some small
		functions. In particular, it provides a useful function for
		some problems in chemistry. For example, monoa(), monob() and
		mono() function can be used to calculate The pH of weak
		acid/base. The ggpng() function can save the PNG format with
		transparent background. The period_table() function will show
		the periodic table. Also the show_ruler() function will show
		the ruler. The show_color() function is funny and easier to
		show colors. I also provide the symb() function to generate
		multiple symbols at once. The csv2vcf() function provides an
		easy method to generate a file. The sym2poly() and sym2coef()
		function can extract coefficients from polynomials.
