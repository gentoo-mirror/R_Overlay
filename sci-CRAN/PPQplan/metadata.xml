		Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) Plans in Chemistry,
		Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) Statistical Analysis //
		Assessment for statistically-based PPQ sampling plan, including
		calculating the passing probability, optimizing the baseline
		and high performance cutoff points, visualizing the PPQ plan
		and power dynamically. The analytical idea is based on the
		simulation methods from the textbook Burdick, R. K., LeBlond,
