		'ggplot2' Based Publication Ready Plots // The 'ggplot2' package
		is excellent and flexible for elegant data visualization in R.
		However the default generated plots requires some formatting
		before we can send them for publication. Furthermore, to
		customize a 'ggplot', the syntax is opaque and this raises the
		level of difficulty for researchers with no advanced R
		programming skills. 'ggpubr' provides some easy-to-use
		functions for creating and customizing 'ggplot2'- based
		publication ready plots.
