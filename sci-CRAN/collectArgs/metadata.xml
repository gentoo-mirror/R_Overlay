		Quickly and Neatly Collect Arguments from One Environment to Pass
		to Another // We often want to take all (or most) of the
		objects in one environment (such as the parameter values of a
		function) and pass them to another. This might be calling a
		second function, or iterating over a list, calling the same
		function. These functions wrap often repeated code. Current
		stable version (committed on October 14, 2017).
