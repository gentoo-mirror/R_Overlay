		Make Symmetric and Asymmetric ARDL Estimations // Implements
		estimation procedures for Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL)
		and Nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) models, which allow researchers to
		investigate both short- and long-run relationships in time
		series data under mixed orders of integration. The package
		supports simultaneous modeling of symmetric and asymmetric
		regressors, flexible treatment of short-run and long-run
		asymmetries, and automated equation handling. It includes
		several cointegration testing approaches such as the Pesaran-
		Shin-Smith F and t bounds tests, the Banerjee error correction
		test, and the restricted ECM test, together with diagnostic
		tools including Wald tests for asymmetry, ARCH tests, and
		stability procedures (CUSUM and CUSUMQ). Methodological
		foundations are provided in Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001)
		doi:10.1016/S0304-4076(01)00049-5 and Shin, Yu, and Greenwood-
		Nimmo (2014, ISBN:9780123855079).
