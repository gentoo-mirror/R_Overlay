		Locating Distributional Changes in Highly Dependent Time Series
		// Provides algorithms to locate multiple distributional
		change-points in piecewise stationary time series. The
		algorithms are provably consistent, even in the presence of
		long-range dependencies. Knowledge of the number of change-
		points is not required. The code is written in Go and
		interfaced with R.
