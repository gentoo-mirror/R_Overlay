		Adaptive Enrichment Designs with Sample Size Re-Estimation //
		Software of 'esDesign' is developed to implement the adaptive
		enrichment designs with sample size re-estimation. In details,
		three-proposed trial designs are provided, including the
		AED1-SSR (or ES1-SSR), AED2-SSR (or ES2-SSR) and AED3-SSR (or
		ES3-SSR). In addition, this package also contains several
		widely used adaptive designs, such as the Marker Sequential
		Test (MaST) design proposed Freidlin et al. (2014)
		doi:10.1177/1740774513503739, the adaptive enrichment designs
		without early stopping (AED or ES), the sample size re-
		estimation procedure (SSR) based on the conditional power
		proposed by Proschan and Hunsberger (1995) doi:10.2307/2533262,
		and some useful functions. In details, we can calculate the
		futility and/or efficacy stopping boundaries, the sample size
		required, calibrate the value of the threshold of the
		difference between subgroup-specific test statistics, conduct
		the simulation studies in AED, SSR, AED1-SSR, AED2-SSR and
		AED3-SSR.
