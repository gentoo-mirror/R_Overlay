		Correcting Nonparametric Frontier Measurements for Outliers //
		Provides method used to check whether data have outlier in
		efficiency measurement of big samples with data envelopment
		analysis (DEA). In this jackstrap method, the package provides
		two criteria to define outliers: heaviside and k-s test. The
