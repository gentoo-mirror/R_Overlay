		Codon Usage Bias Fits // Estimating mutation and selection
		coefficients on synonymous codon bias usage based on models of
		ribosome overhead cost (ROC). Multinomial logistic regression
		and Markov Chain Monte Carlo are used to estimate and predict
		protein production rates with/without the presence of
		expressions and measurement errors. Work flows with examples
		for simulation, estimation and prediction processes are also
		provided with parallelization speedup. The whole framework is
		tested with yeast genome and gene expression data of Yassour,
		et al. (2009) doi:10.1073/pnas.0812841106.
