		Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space Modeling // The MARSS
		package provides maximum-likelihood parameter estimation for
		constrained and unconstrained linear multivariate
		autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models fit to multivariate
		time-series data.  Fitting is primarily via an Expectation-
		Maximization (EM) algorithm, although fitting via the BFGS
		algorithm (using the optim function) is also provided.  MARSS
		models are a class of dynamic linear model (DLM) and vector
		autoregressive model (VAR) model.  Functions are provided for
		parametric and innovations bootstrapping, Kalman filtering and
		smoothing, bootstrap model selection criteria (AICb),
		confidences intervals via the Hessian approximation and via
		bootstrapping and calculation of auxiliary residuals for
		detecting outliers and shocks.  The user guide shows examples
		of using MARSS for parameter estimation for a variety of
		applications, model selection, dynamic factor analysis, outlier
		and shock detection, and addition of covariates.  Online
		workshops (lectures, eBook, and computer labs) at https://atsa-
		es.github.io/  See the NEWS file for update information.
