		Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space Modeling // The MARSS
		package provides maximum-likelihood parameter estimation for
		constrained and unconstrained linear multivariate
		autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models, including partially
		deterministic models. MARSS models are a class of dynamic
		linear model (DLM) and vector autoregressive model (VAR) model.
		Fitting available via Expectation-Maximization (EM), BFGS
		(using optim), and 'TMB' (using the 'marssTMB' companion
		package). Functions are provided for parametric and innovations
		bootstrapping, Kalman filtering and smoothing, model selection
		criteria including bootstrap AICb, confidences intervals via
		the Hessian approximation or bootstrapping, and all conditional
		residual types. See the user guide for examples of dynamic
		factor analysis, dynamic linear models, outlier and shock
		detection, and multivariate AR-p models. Online workshops
		(lectures, eBook, and computer labs) at https://atsa-
		es.github.io/.
