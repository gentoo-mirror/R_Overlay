		Two-Sample Test in High Dimensions using Random Projection //
		Performs the random projection test (Lopes et al., (2011)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1108.2401) for the one-sample and two-sample
		hypothesis testing problem for equality of means in the high
		dimensional setting. We are interested in detecting the mean
		vector in the one-sample problem or the difference between mean
		vectors in the two-sample problem.
