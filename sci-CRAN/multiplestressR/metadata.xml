		Additive and Multiplicative Null Models for Multiple Stressor
		Data // An implementation of the additive (Gurevitch et al.,
		2000 doi:10.1086/303337) and multiplicative (Lajeunesse, 2011
		doi:10.1890/11-0423.1) factorial null models for multiple
		stressor data (Burgess et al., 2021
		doi:10.1101/2021.07.21.453207). Effect sizes are able to be
		calculated for either null model, and subsequently classified
		into one of four different interaction classifications (e.g.,
		antagonistic or synergistic interactions). Analyses can be
		conducted on data for single experiments through to large meta-
		analytical datasets. Minimal input (or statistical knowledge)
		is required, with any output easily understood. Summary figures
		are also able to be easily generated.
