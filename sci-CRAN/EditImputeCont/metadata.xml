		Simultaneous Edit-Imputation for Continuous Microdata // An
		integrated editing and imputation method for continuous
		microdata under linear constraints is implemented. It relies on
		a Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical modeling approach as
		described in Kim et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1040881. In this approach, the joint
		distribution of the data is estimated by a flexible joint
		probability model. The generated edit-imputed data are
		guaranteed to satisfy all imposed edit rules, whose types
		include ratio edits, balance edits and range restrictions.
