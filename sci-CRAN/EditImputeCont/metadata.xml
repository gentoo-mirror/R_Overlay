		Simultaneous Edit-Imputation for Continuous Microdata // An
		integrated editing and imputation method for continuous
		microdata under linear constraints is implemented. It relies on
		a Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical modeling approach in
		which the joint distribution of the data is estimated by a
		flexible joint probability model. The generated edit-imputed
		data are guaranteed to satisfy all imposed edit rules, whose
		types include ratio edits, balance edits and range
		restrictions.
