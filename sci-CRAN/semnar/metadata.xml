		Constructing and Interacting with Databases of Presentations //
		Provides methods for constructing and maintaining a database of
		presentations in R. The presentations are either ones that the
		user gives or gave or presentations at a particular event or
		event series. The package also provides a plot method for the
		interactive mapping of the presentations using 'leaflet' by
		grouping them according to country, city, year and other
		presentation attributes. The markers on the map come with
		popups providing presentation details (title, institution,
		event, links to materials and events, and so on).
