		Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models //
		Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis
		tests in multivariate linear models. HE plots represent sums-
		of-squares-and-products matrices for linear hypotheses and for
		error using ellipses (in two dimensions) and ellipsoids (in
		three dimensions). It also provides other tools for analysis
		and graphical display of the models such as robust methods and
		homogeneity of variance covariance matrices. The related
		'candisc' package provides visualizations in a reduced-rank
		canonical discriminant space when there are more than a few
		response variables.
