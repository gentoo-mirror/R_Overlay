		Explore the UK's National Power Grid Datasets // The purpose of
		'Relexon' is to allow R users to pull data from the UK's
		Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service, otherwise known as
		'Elexon', using the 'BMRS' API
		https://www.bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=help/about-us. This can range
		from different types of electricity generation, how much
		electricity is used in a 5-minute period, imports, temperatures
		and forecasts. Users will require an 'Elexon' key, which are
		freely available by registering at
		https://www.elexonportal.co.uk.
