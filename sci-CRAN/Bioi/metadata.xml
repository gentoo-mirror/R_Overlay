		Biological Image Analysis // Single linkage clustering and
		connected component analyses are often performed on biological
		images. 'Bioi' provides a set of functions for performing these
		tasks. This functionality is implemented in several key
		functions that can extend to from 1 to many dimensions. The
		single linkage clustering method implemented here can be used
		on n-dimensional data sets, while connected component analyses
		are limited to 3 or fewer dimensions.
