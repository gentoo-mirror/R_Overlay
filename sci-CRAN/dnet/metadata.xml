		Integrative Analysis of Omics Data in Terms of Network, Evolution
		and Ontology // The focus of the dnet by Fang and Gough (2014)
		doi:10.1186/s13073-014-0064-8 is to make sense of omics data
		(such as gene expression and mutations) from different angles
		including: integration with molecular networks, enrichments
		using ontologies, and relevance to gene evolutionary ages.
		Integration is achieved to identify a gene subnetwork from the
		whole gene network whose nodes/genes are labelled with
		informative data (such as the significant levels of
		differential expression or survival risks). To help make sense
		of identified gene networks, enrichment analysis is also
		supported using a wide variety of pre-compiled ontologies and
		phylostratific gene age information in major organisms
		including: human, mouse, rat, chicken, C.elegans, fruit fly,
		zebrafish and arabidopsis. Add-on functionalities are supports
		for calculating semantic similarity between ontology terms (and
		between genes) and for calculating network affinity based on
		random walk; both can be done via high-performance parallel
		computing.
