		Break Down Plots // Break Down Plots are inspired by waterfall
		plots created by 'xgboostExplainer' package (see https://github
		.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/xgboostExplainer). The idea
		behind Break Down Plots it to decompose model prediction for a
		single observation. Break Down Plots show the contribution of
		every variable present in the model. Such plots will work for
		binary classifiers and general regression models.
