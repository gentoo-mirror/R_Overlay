		Analyte Flux and Load from Estimates of Concentration and
		Discharge // Flux (mass per unit time) and Load (mass) are
		computed from timeseries estimates of analyte concentration and
		discharge. Concentration timeseries are computed from
		regression between surrogate and user-provided analyte.
		Uncertainty in calculations is estimated using bootstrap
		resampling. Code for the processing of acoustic backscatter
		from horizontally profiling acoustic Doppler current profilers
		is provided. All methods detailed in Livsey et al (2020)
