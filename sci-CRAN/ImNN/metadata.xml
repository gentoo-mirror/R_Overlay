		Neural Networks for Predicting Volume of Forest Trees // Neural
		network has potential in forestry modelling. This package is
		designed to create and assess Artificial Intelligence based
		Neural Networks with varying architectures for prediction of
		volume of forest trees using two input features: height and
		diameter at breast height, as they are the key factors in
		predicting volume, therefore development and validation of
		efficient volume prediction neural network model is necessary.
		This package has been developed using the algorithm of Tabassum
		et al. (2022) doi:10.18805/ag.D-5555.
