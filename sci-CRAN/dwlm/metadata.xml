		Doubly Weighted Linear Model // This linear model solution is
		useful when both predictor and response have associated
		uncertainty. The doubly weights linear model solution is
		invariant on which quantity is used as predictor or response.
		Based on the results by Reed(1989) doi:10.1119/1.15963 and
		Ripley  Thompson(1987) doi:10.1039/AN9871200377.
