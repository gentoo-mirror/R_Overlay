		Jot Down Values for Later // Reproducible work requires a record
		of where every statistic originated. When writing reports, some
		data is too big to load in the same environment and some
		statistics take a while to compute. This package offers a way
		to keep notes on statistics, simple functions, and small
		objects. Notepads can be locked to avoid accidental updates.
		Notepads keep track of who added the notes and when the notes
		were added. A simple text representation is used to allow for
		clear version histories.
