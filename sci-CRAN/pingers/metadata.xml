		Identify, Ping, and Log Internet Provider Connection Data // To
		assist you with troubleshooting internet connection issues and
		assist in isolating packet loss on your network. It does this
		by allowing you to retrieve the top trace route destinations
		your internet provider uses, and recursively ping each server
		in series while capturing the results and writing them to a log
		file. Each iteration it queries the destinations again, before
		shuffling the sequence of destinations to ensure the analysis
		is unbiased and consistent across each trace route.
