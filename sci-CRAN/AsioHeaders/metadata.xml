		'Asio' C++ Header Files // 'Asio' is a cross-platform C++ library
		for network and low-level I/O programming that provides
		developers with a consistent asynchronous model using a modern
		C++ approach. It is also included in Boost but requires linking
		when used with Boost. Standalone it can be used header-only
		(provided a recent compiler). 'Asio' is written and maintained
		by Christopher M. Kohlhoff, and released under the 'Boost
		Software License', Version 1.0.
