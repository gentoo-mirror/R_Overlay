		Calculate the Cost and Environmental Impact of a Ideal Diet //
		Easily perform a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the cost
		and carbon, ecological, and water footprints of a set of ideal
		diets. Pre-processing tools are also available to quickly treat
		the data, along with basic statistical features to analyze the
		simulation results  including the ability to establish
		confidence intervals for selected parameters, such as nutrients
		and price/emissions. A 'standard version' of the datasets
		employed is included as well, allowing users easy access to
		customization. This package brings to R the 'Python' software
		initially developed by Vandevijvere, Young, Mackay, Swinburn
		and Gahegan (2018) doi:10.1186/s12966-018-0648-6.
