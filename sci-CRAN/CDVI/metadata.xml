		Cuddy-Della Valle Index for Capturing the Instability in Time
		Series Data // Cuddy-Della valle index gives the degree of
		instability present in the data by accommodating the effect of
		a trend. The adjusted R squared value of the best fitted model
		is chosen. The index is obtained by multiplying the coefficient
		of variation with square root of one minus the adjusted
		R-squared value. This package has been developed using concept
		of Shankar et al. (2022)doi:10.3389/fsufs.2023.1208898.
