		Manage R Environments Better // Provides a small set of functions
		for managing R environments, with defaults designed to
		encourage usage patterns that scale well to larger code bases.
		It provides: import_from(), a flexible way to assign bindings
		that defaults to the current environment; include(), a
		vectorized alternative to base::source() that also default to
		the current environment; and attach_eval() and attach_source(),
		a way to evaluate expressions in attached environments.
		Together, these (and other) functions pair to provide a robust
		alternative to base::library() and base::source().
