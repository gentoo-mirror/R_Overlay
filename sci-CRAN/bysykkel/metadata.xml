		Get, Download, and Read City Bike Data from Norway // Functions
		to get, download, and read open data from each City Bike
		website, and each City Bike API, in Norway that is made
		available under the NLOD 2.0 https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/2.0.
		These functions speed up the process of reading city bike data
		directly to R, and to download the data to disk, so that the
		user can focus on data analysis. The data is retrieved from the
		"developer" or "open data" pages of Oslo City Bike
		https://developer.oslobysykkel.no/, Oslo Winter Bike
		https://oslovintersykkel.no/en/open-data, Bergen City Bike
		https://bergenbysykkel.no/en/open-data, and Trondheim City Bike
		https://trondheimbysykkel.no/en/open-data.
