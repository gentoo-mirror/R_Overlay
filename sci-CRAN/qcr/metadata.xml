		Quality Control Review // Univariate and multivariate SQC tools
		that completes and increases the SQC techniques available in R.
		Apart from integrating different R packages devoted to SQC
		('qcc','MSQC'), provides nonparametric tools that are highly
		useful when Gaussian assumption is not met. This package
		computes standard univariate control charts for individual
		measurements, X-bar, S, R, p, np, c, u, EWMA and CUSUM. In
		addition, it includes functions to perform multivariate control
		charts such as Hotelling T2, MEWMA and MCUSUM. As
		representative feature, multivariate nonparametric alternatives
		based on data depth are implemented in this package: r, Q and S
		control charts. In addition, Phase I and II control charts for
		functional data are included. This package also allows the
		estimation of the most complete set of capability indices from
		first to fourth generation, covering the nonparametric
		alternatives, and performing the corresponding capability
		analysis graphical outputs, including the process capability
		plots.
