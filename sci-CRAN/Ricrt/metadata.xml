		Randomization Inference of Clustered Randomized Trials // Methods
		for randomization inference in group-randomized trials.
		Specifically, it can be used to analyze the treatment effect of
		stratified data with multiple clusters in each stratum with
		treatment given on cluster level. User may also input as many
		covariates as they want to fit the data. Methods are described
		by Dylan S Small et al., (2012) doi:10.1198/016214507000000897.
