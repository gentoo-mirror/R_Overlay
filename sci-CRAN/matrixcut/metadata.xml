		Determines Clustering Threshold Based on Similarity Values // The
		user must supply a matrix filled with similarity values. The
		software will search for significant differences between
		similarity values at different hierarchical levels. The
		algorithm will return a Loess-smoothed plot of the similarity
		values along with the inflection point, if there are any. There
		is the option to search for an inflection point within a
		specified range. The package also has a function that will
		return the matrix components at a specified cutoff. References:
