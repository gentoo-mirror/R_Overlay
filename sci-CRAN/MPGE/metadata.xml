		A Two-Step Approach to Testing Overall Effect of Gene-Environment
		Interaction for Multiple Phenotypes // Interaction between a
		genetic variant (e.g., a single nucleotide polymorphism) and an
		environmental variable (e.g., physical activity) can have a
		shared effect on multiple phenotypes (e.g., blood lipids). We
		implement a two-step method to test for an overall interaction
		effect on multiple phenotypes. In first step, the method tests
		for an overall marginal genetic association between the genetic
		variant and the multivariate phenotype. The genetic variants
		which show an evidence of marginal overall genetic effect in
		the first step are prioritized while testing for an overall
		gene-environment interaction effect in the second step.
