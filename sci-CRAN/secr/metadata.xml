		Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture // Functions to estimate the
		density and size of a spatially distributed animal population
		sampled with an array of passive detectors, such as traps, or
		by searching polygons or transects. Models incorporating
		distance-dependent detection are fitted by maximizing the
		likelihood. Tools are included for data manipulation and model
		selection.
