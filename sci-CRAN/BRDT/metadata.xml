		Binomial Reliability Demonstration Tests // This is an
		implementation of design methods for binomial reliability
		demonstration tests (BRDTs) with failure count data. The
		acceptance decision uncertainty of BRDT has been quantified and
		the impacts of the uncertainty on related reliability assurance
		activities such as reliability growth (RG) and warranty
		services (WS) are evaluated. This package is associated with
		the work from the published paper "Optimal Binomial Reliability
		Demonstration Tests Design under Acceptance Decision
		Uncertainty" by Suiyao Chen et al. (2020)
