		Single Reader Between-Cases AUC Estimator in Nested Data // This
		R package provides a calculation of between-cases AUC estimate,
		corresponding covariance, and variance estimate in the nested
		data problem.  Also, the package has the function to simulate
		the nested data. The calculated between-cases AUC estimate is
		used to evaluate the reader's diagnostic performance in
		clinical tasks with nested data. For more details on the above
		methods, please refer to the paper by H Du, S Wen, Y Guo, F
		Jin, BD Gallas (2022) doi:10.1177/09622802221111539.
