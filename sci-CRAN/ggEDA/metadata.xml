		Turnkey Visualisations for Exploratory Data Analysis // Provides
		interactive visualisations for exploratory data analysis of
		high-dimensional datasets. Includes parallel coordinate plots
		for exploring large datasets with mostly quantitative features,
		but also stacked one-dimensional visualisations that more
		effectively show missingness and complex categorical
		relationships in smaller datasets.
