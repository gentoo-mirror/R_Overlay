		Compute the Personalized Activity Index Based on a Flexible
		Bayesian Negative Binomial Model // The functions in this
		package implement the safety monitoring procedures proposed in
		the paper titled "A flexible mixed effect negative binomial
		regression model for detecting unusual increases in MRI lesion
		counts in individual multiple sclerosis patients" by Kondo, Y.,
		Zhao, Y. and Petkau, A.J. The procedure first models
		longitudinally collected count variables with a negative
		binomial mixed-effect regression model. To account for the
		correlation among repeated measures from the same patient, the
		model has subject-specific random intercept, which is modelled
		with the infinite mixture of Beta distributions, very flexible
		distribution that theoretically allows any form. The package
		also has the option of a single beta distribution for random
		effects. These mixed-effect models could be useful beyond the
		application of the safety monitoring. The inference is based on
		MCMC samples and this package contains a Gibbs sampler to
		sample from the posterior distribution of the negative binomial
		mixed-effect regression model. Based on the fitted model, the
		personalized activity index is computed for each patient.
		Lastly, this package is companion to R package lmeNB, which
		contains the functions to compute the Personalized Activity
		Index in the frequentist framework.
