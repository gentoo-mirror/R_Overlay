		Simple Visualisation with 'ggplot2' and 'leaflet' Wrappers //
		Provides 'ggplot2' and 'leaflet' wrapper functions designed to
		simplify the creation of high quality graph and map
		visualisations. These functions only require inputs of data,
		variables and titles to provide beautiful interactive or image
		visualisations. However they allow for more flexibility if
		required. The intent is that high quality well-designed graphs
		and maps can be made more consistently with less effort, code
		and expertise than would otherwise be required.
