		Powerful Replicability Analysis of Genome-Wide Association
		Studies // A robust and powerful approach is developed for
		replicability analysis of two Genome-wide association studies
		(GWASs) accounting for the linkage disequilibrium (LD) among
		genetic variants. The LD structure in two GWASs is captured by
		a four-state hidden Markov model (HMM). The unknowns involved
		in the HMM are estimated by an efficient expectation-
		maximization (EM) algorithm in combination with a non-
		parametric estimation of functions. By incorporating
		information from adjacent locations via the HMM, this approach
		identifies the entire clusters of genotype-phenotype associated
		signals, improving the power of replicability analysis while
		effectively controlling the false discovery rate.
