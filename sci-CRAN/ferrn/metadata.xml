		Facilitate Exploration of touRR optimisatioN // Diagnostic plots
		for optimisation, with a focus on projection pursuit. These
		show paths the optimiser takes in the high-dimensional space in
		multiple ways: by reducing the dimension using principal
		component analysis, and also using the tour to show the path on
		the high-dimensional space. Several botanical colour palettes
		are included, reflecting the name of the package.
