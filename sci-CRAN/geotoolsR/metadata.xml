		Tools to Improve the Use of Geostatistic // The basic idea of
		this package is provides some tools to help the researcher to
		work with geostatistics. Initially, we present a collection of
		functions that allow the researchers to deal with spatial data
		using bootstrap procedure.There are five methods available and
		two ways to display them: bootstrap confidence interval -
		provides a two-sided bootstrap confidence interval; bootstrap
		plot - a graphic with the original variogram and each of the B
		bootstrap variograms.
