		Automated Gene Identification for Post-GWAS and QTL Analysis //
		Facilitates the post-Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and
		Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis of identifying candidate
		genes within user-defined search window, based on the
		identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as given by
		Mazumder AK (2024) doi:10.1038/s41598-024-66903-3. It supports
		candidate gene analysis for wheat and rice. Just import your
		GWAS result as explained in the sample_data file and the
		function does all the manual search and retrieve candidate
		genes for you, while exporting the results into ready-to-use
		output.
