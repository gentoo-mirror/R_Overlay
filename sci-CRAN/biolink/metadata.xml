		Create Hyperlinks to Biological Databases and Resources //
		Generate urls and hyperlinks to commonly used biological
		databases and resources based on standard identifiers. This is
		primarily useful when writing dynamic reports that reference
		things like gene symbols in text or tables, allowing you to,
		for example, convert gene identifiers to hyperlinks pointing to
		their entry in the 'NCBI' Gene database. Currently supports
		'NCBI' Gene, 'PubMed', Gene Ontology, 'KEGG', CRAN and
		Bioconductor.
