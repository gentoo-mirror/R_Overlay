		In-Silico Knockout Experiments from Single-Cell Gene Regulatory
		Networks // A workflow based on 'scTenifoldNet' to perform in-
		silico knockout experiments using single-cell RNA sequencing
		(scRNA-seq) data from wild-type (WT) control samples as input.
		First, the package constructs a single-cell gene regulatory
		network (scGRN) and knocks out a target gene from the adjacency
		matrix of the WT scGRN by setting the genes outdegree edges to
		zero. Then, it compares the knocked out scGRN with the WT scGRN
		to identify differentially regulated genes, called virtual-
		knockout perturbed genes, which are used to assess the impact
		of the gene knockout and reveal the genes function in the
		analyzed cells.
