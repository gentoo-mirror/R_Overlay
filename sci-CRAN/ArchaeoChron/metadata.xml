		Bayesian Modeling of Archaeological Chronologies // Provides a
		list of functions for the Bayesian modeling of archaeological
		chronologies. The Bayesian models are implemented in 'JAGS'
		('JAGS' stands for Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program
		for the analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. See http://mcmc-
		jags.sourceforge.net/ and "JAGS Version 4.3.0 user manual",
		Martin Plummer (2017) https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-
		jags/files/Manuals/.). The inputs are measurements with their
		associated standard deviations and the study period. The output
		is the MCMC sample of the posterior distribution of the event
		date with or without radiocarbon calibration.
