		Renewal Hawkes Process // The renewal Hawkes (RHawkes) process
		(Wheatley, Filimonov, and Sornette, 2016
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2015.08.007) is an extension to the
		classical Hawkes self-exciting point process widely used in the
		modelling of clustered event sequence data. This package
		provides functions to simulate the RHawkes process with a given
		immigrant hazard rate function and offspring birth time density
		function, to compute the exact likelihood of a RHawkes process
		using the recursive algorithm proposed by Chen and Stindl
		(2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1341324, to compute the
		Rosenblatt residuals for goodness-of-fit assessment, and to
		predict future event times based on observed event times up to
		a given time. A function implementing the linear time RHawkes
		process likelihood approximation algorithm proposed in Stindl
		and Chen (2021) doi:10.1007/s11222-021-10002-0 is also
		included.
