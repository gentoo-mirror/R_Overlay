		Renewal Hawkes Process // Simulate a renewal Hawkes (RHawkes)
		self-exciting process, with a given immigrant hazard rate
		function and offspring density function. Calculate the
		likelihood of a RHawkes process with given hazard rate function
		and offspring density function for an (increasing) sequence of
		event times. Calculate the Rosenblatt residuals of the event
		times. Predict future event times based on observed event times
		up to a given time. For details see Chen and Stindl (2017)
