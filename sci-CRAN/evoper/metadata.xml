		Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for 'Repast Simphony' Models //
		The EvoPER, Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for Individual-
		based Models is an extensible package providing optimization
		driven parameter estimation methods using metaheuristics  and
		evolutionary computation techniques (Particle Swarm
		Optimization, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization for
		continuous domains, Tabu Search, Evolutionary Strategies, ...)
		which could be more efficient and require, in some cases, fewer
		model evaluations than alternatives relying on experimental
		design.  Currently there are built in support for models
		developed with 'Repast Simphony'  Agent-Based framework
		(https://repast.github.io/) and with NetLogo
		(https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) which are the most used
		frameworks for Agent-based modeling.
