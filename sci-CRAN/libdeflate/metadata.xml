		DEFLATE Compression and Static Library // Whole-buffer DEFLATE-
		based compression and decompression of raw vectors using the
		'libdeflate' library (see
		https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate). Provides the user with
		additional control over the speed and the quality of DEFLATE
		compression compared to the fixed level of compression offered
		in R's 'memCompress()' function. Also provides the 'libdeflate'
		static library and 'C' headers along with a 'CMake' target and
		'packageconfig' file that ease linking of 'libdeflate' in
		packages that compile and statically link bundled libraries
		using 'CMake'.
