		Distribution of Gaussian Ratios // It is well known that the
		distribution of a Gaussian ratio does not follow a Gaussian
		distribution. The lack of awareness among users of vegetation
		indices about this non-Gaussian nature could lead to incorrect
		statistical modeling and interpretation. This package provides
		tools to accurately handle and analyse such ratios: density
		function, parameter estimation, simulation. An example on the
		study of chlorophyll fluorescence can be found in A. El Ghaziri
		et al. (2023) doi:10.3390/rs15020528.
