		Mapping Fisheries Data and Spatial Analysis Tools // This
		software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the
		Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in 'Nanaimo', British
		Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language to include two-
		dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly
		available in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Embedded C
		code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
		finding polygons that contain specified point events or
		converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse
		Mercator (UTM) coordinates. Additionally, we include 'C++' code
		developed by Angus Johnson for the 'Clipper' library, data for
		a global shoreline, and other data sets in the public domain.
		Under the user's R library directory '.libPaths()',
		specifically in './PBSmapping/doc', a complete user's guide is
		offered and should be consulted to use package functions
		effectively.
