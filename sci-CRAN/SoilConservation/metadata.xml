		Soil and Water Conservation // Includes four functions:
		RFactor_calc(), RFactor_est(), KFactor() and SoilLoss(). The
		rainfall erosivity factors can be calculated or estimated, and
		soil erodibility will be estimated by the equation extracted
		from the monograph. Soil loss will be estimated by the product
		of five factors (rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, length
		and steepness slope, cover-management factor and support
		practice factor. In the future, additional functions can be
		included. This efforts to advance research in soil and water
		conservation, with fast and accurate results.
