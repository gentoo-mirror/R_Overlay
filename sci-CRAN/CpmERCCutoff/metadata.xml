		Calculation of Log2 Counts per Million Cutoff from ERCC Controls
		// Implementation of the empirical method to derive log2 counts
		per million (CPM) cutoff to filter out lowly expressed genes
		using ERCC spike-ins as described in Goll and Bosinger et.al
		(2022)doi:10.1101/2022.06.23.497396. This package utilizes the
		synthetic mRNA control pairs developed by the External RNA
		Controls Consortium (ERCC) (ERCC 1 / ERCC 2) that are spiked
		into sample pairs at known ratios at various absolute
		abundances.  The relationship between the observed and expected
		fold changes is then used to empirically determine an optimal
		log2 CPM cutoff for filtering out lowly expressed genes.
