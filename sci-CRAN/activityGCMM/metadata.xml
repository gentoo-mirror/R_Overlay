		Circular Mixed Effect Mixture Models of Animal Activity Patterns
		// Bayesian parametric generalized circular mixed effect
		mixture models (GCMMs) for estimating animal activity patterns
		from camera trap data and other nested data structures using
		'JAGS', including automatic Bayesian k-cluster selection and
		random circular intercepts for nested data. The GCMM function
		automatically selects the number of components for the mixture
		model (supporting up to 4 mixture components) based on a
		Bayesian linear finite normal mixture model and fits a Bayesian
		parametric circular mixed effect  mixture model with one or two
		random effects as random circular intercepts with a a von Mises
		or wrapped Cauchy distribution. Provides graphs of the combined
		mixture model or separate mixture components. Functionality is
		provided to allow quantitative  comparisons between model
		parameters. See Campbell et al. (in press) It's time to expand
		our analyses of animal activity;  Campbell et al. (in press)
		Temporal and microspatial niche partitioning; Campbell et al.
		(in press) A novel approach to comparing animal activity
		patterns. News, updates, and tutorials will be available on
		www.atlasgoldenwolf.org/stats and www.github.com/LizADCampbell
