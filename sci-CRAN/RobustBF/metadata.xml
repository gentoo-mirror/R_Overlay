		Robust Solution to the Behrens-Fisher Problem // Robust tests (RW
		and RF) are provided for testing the equality of two long-
		tailed symmetric (LTS) means when the variances are unknown and
		arbitrary. RW test is a robust version of Welch's two sample t
		test and the RF is a robust fiducial based test. The RW and RF
		tests are proposed using the adaptive modified maximum
		likelihood (AMML) estimators derived by Tiku and Surucu (2009)
