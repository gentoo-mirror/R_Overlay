		Miscellaneous Pedometric Tools // An R implementation of methods
		employed in the field of pedometrics, soil science discipline
		dedicated to studying the spatial, temporal, and spatio-
		temporal variation of soil using statistical and computational
		methods. The methods found here include the calibration of
		linear regression models using covariate selection strategies,
		computation of summary validation statistics for predictions,
		generation of summary plots, evaluation of the local quality of
		a geostatistical model of uncertainty, and so on. Other
		functions simply extend the functionalities of or facilitate
		the usage of functions from other packages that are commonly
		used for the analysis of soil data. Formerly available versions
		of suggested packages no longer available from CRAN can be
		obtained from the CRAN archive
		https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/.
