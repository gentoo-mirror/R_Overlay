		A Universal Approach for Causal Mediation Analysis // This
		program realizes a universal estimation approach that
		accommodates multi-category variables and effect scales, making
		up for the deficiencies of the existing approaches when dealing
		with non-binary exposures and complex models. The estimation
		via bootstrapping can simultaneously provide results of causal
		mediation on risk difference (RD), odds ratio (OR) and risk
		ratio (RR) scales with tests of the effects' difference. The
		estimation is also applicable to many other settings, e.g.,
		moderated mediation, inconsistent covariates, panel data, etc.
		The high flexibility and compatibility make it possible to
		apply for any type of model, greatly meeting the needs of
		current empirical researches.
