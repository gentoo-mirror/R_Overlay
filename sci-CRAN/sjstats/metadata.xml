		Collection of Convenient Functions for Common Statistical
		Computations // Collection of convenient functions for common
		statistical computations, which are not directly provided by
		R's base or stats packages. This package aims at providing,
		first, shortcuts for statistical measures, which otherwise
		could only be calculated with additional effort (like Cramer's
		V, Phi, or effect size statistics like Eta or Omega squared),
		or for which currently no functions available. Second, another
		focus lies on weighted variants of common statistical measures
		and tests like weighted standard error, mean, t-test,
		correlation, and more.
