		Collection of Convenient Functions for Common Statistical
		Computations // Collection of convenient functions for common
		statistical computations, which are not directly provided by
		R's base or stats packages. This package aims at providing,
		first, shortcuts for statistical measures, which otherwise
		could only be calculated with additional effort (like standard
		errors or root mean squared errors). Second, these shortcut
		functions are generic (if appropriate), and can be applied not
		only to vectors, but also to other objects as well (e.g., the
		Coefficient of Variation can be computed for vectors, linear
		models, or linear mixed models; the r2()-function returns the
		r-squared value for 'lm', 'glm', 'merMod' and other model
		objects). The focus of most functions lies on summary
		statistics or fit measures for regression models, including
		generalized linear models, mixed effects models and Bayesian
		models. However, some of the functions also deal with other
		statistical measures, like Cronbach's Alpha, Cramer's V, Phi
		etc.
