		Optimal Design and Statistical Power of Multilevel Randomized
		Trials // Calculate the optimal sample allocation that produces
		smallest variance of a treatment effect or the highest
		statistical power for experimental studies under a budget
		constraint, perform power analyses with and without
		accommodating cost structures of sampling, and calculate the
		relative efficiency between two sample allocations. The
		references for the proposed methods are: (1) Shen, Z. (2019).
