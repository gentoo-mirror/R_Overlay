		Optimal Design and Statistical Power of Cost-Efficient Multilevel
		Randomized Trials // Calculate the optimal sample allocation
		that minimizes variance of treatment effect in a multilevel
		randomized trial under fixed budget and cost structure, perform
		power analyses with and without accommodating costs and budget.
		The reference for proposed methods is: Shen, Z.,  Kelcey, B.
