		Optimal Design and Statistical Power for Multilevel Experiments
		Investigating Main, Mediation, and Moderation Effects //
		Calculate the optimal sample allocation that produces the
		highest statistical power for experimental studies under a
		budget constraint, perform power analyses with and without
		accommodating cost structures of sampling, and calculate the
		relative efficiency between two sample allocations. The
		references for the proposed methods include: (1) Shen, Z.,

		costs in cluster-randomized trials. Journal of Educational and
		Behavioral Statistics, 45(4): 446-474.
