		Optimal Design and Statistical Power for Experimental Studies
		Investigating Main, Mediation, and Moderation Effects //
		Calculate the optimal sample size allocation that produces the
		highest statistical power for experimental studies under a
		budget constraint, and perform power analyses with and without
		accommodating cost structures of sampling. The designs cover
		single-level and multilevel experiments detecting main,
		mediation, and moderation effects (and some combinations). The
		references for the proposed methods include: (1) Shen, Z.,
		Kelcey, B. (2020). Optimal sample allocation under unequal
		costs in cluster-randomized trials. Journal of Educational and
		Behavioral Statistics, 45(4): 446-474.
