		Optimal Design and Statistical Power of Multilevel Randomized
		Trials // Calculate the optimal sample allocation that
		minimizes the variance of treatment effect in multilevel
		randomized trials under fixed budget and cost structure,
		perform power analyses with and without accommodating costs and
		budget. The references for proposed methods are: (1) Shen, Z.

		statistical precision and design efficiency for multilevel
		randomized trials. (unpublished doctoral dissertation).
