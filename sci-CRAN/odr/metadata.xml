		Optimal Design and Statistical Power of Multilevel Randomized
		Trials // Calculate the optimal sample allocation that produces
		the highest statistical power for experimental studies under a
		budget constraint, perform power analyses with and without
		accommodating cost structures of sampling, and calculate the
		relative efficiency between two sample allocations. The
		references for the proposed methods are: (1) Shen, Z.,  Kelcey,

		Behavioral Statistics, 45(4): 446-474.
