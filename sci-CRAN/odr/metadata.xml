		Optimal Design and Statistical Power of Multilevel Randomized
		Trials // Calculate the optimal sample allocation that
		minimizes the variance of treatment effect in multilevel
		randomized trials under fixed budget and cost structure,
		perform power analyses with and without accommodating costs and
		budget. The references for proposed methods are: (1) Shen, Z.,
		Kelcey, B. (2018, April). Optimal design of cluster randomized
		trials under condition- and unit-specific cost structures.
		Roundtable discussion to be presented at American Educational
		Research Association (AERA) annual conference; (2) Shen, Z.,
		Kelcey, B. (under review). Optimal sample allocation under
		unequal costs in cluster-randomized trials. Journal of
		Educational and Behavioral Statistics; (3) Shen, Z.(in

		efficiency for multilevel randomized trials. (Unpublished
