		Data Set of Trig Points in Great Britain in British National Grid
		Coordinates // A complete data set of historic GB trig points
		in British National Grid (OSGB36) coordinate reference system.
		Trig points (aka triangulation stations) are fixed survey
		points used to improve the accuracy of map making in Great
		Britain during the 20th Century. Trig points are typically
		located on hilltops so still serve as a useful navigational aid
		for walkers and hikers today.
