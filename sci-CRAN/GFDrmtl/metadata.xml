		Multiple RMTL-Based Tests for Competing Risks Data in General
		Factorial Designs // We implemented multiple tests based on the
		restricted mean time lost (RMTL) for general factorial designs
		as described in Munko et al. (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2409.07917. Therefore, an asymptotic test
		and a permutation test are incorporated with a Wald-type test
		statistic. The asymptotic test takes the asymptotic exact
		dependence structure of the test statistics into account to
		gain more power. Furthermore, confidence intervals for RMTL
		contrasts can be calculated and plotted and a stepwise
		extension that can improve the power of the multiple tests is
		available.
