		A Constrained L1 Minimization Approach for Estimating Multiple
		Sparse Gaussian or Nonparanormal Graphical Models // This is an
		R implementation of a constrained l1 minimization approach for
		estimating multiple Sparse Gaussian or Nonparanormal Graphical
		Models (SIMULE). The SIMULE algorithm can be used to estimate
		multiple related precision matrices. For instance, it can
		identify context-specific gene networks from multi-context gene
		expression datasets. By performing data-driven network
		inference from high-dimensional and heterogenous data sets,
		this tool can help users effectively translate aggregated data
		into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities.
		Please run demo(simuleDemo) to learn the basic functions
		provided by this package. For further details, please read the
		original paper: Beilun Wang, Ritambhara Singh, Yanjun Qi (2017)
		DOI:10.1007/s10994-017-5635-7.
