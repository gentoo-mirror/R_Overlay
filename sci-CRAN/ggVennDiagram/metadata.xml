		A 'ggplot2' Implement of Venn Diagram // Easy-to-use functions to
		generate 2-7 sets Venn plot in publication quality.
		'ggVennDiagram' plot Venn using well-defined geometry dataset
		and 'ggplot2'. The shapes of 2-4 sets Venn use circles and
		ellipses, while the shapes of 4-7 sets Venn use irregular
		polygons (4 has both forms), which are developed and imported
		from another package 'venn', authored by Adrian Dusa. We
		provided internal functions to integrate shape data with user
		provided sets data, and calculated the geometry of every
		regions/intersections of them, then separately plot Venn in
		three components: set edges, set labels, and regions. From
		version 1.0, it is possible to customize these components as
		you demand in ordinary 'ggplot2' grammar.
