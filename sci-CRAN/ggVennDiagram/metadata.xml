		A 'ggplot2' Implement of Venn Diagram // Easy-to-use functions to
		generate 2-7 sets Venn or upset plot in publication quality.
		'ggVennDiagram' plot Venn or upset using well-defined geometry
		dataset and 'ggplot2'. The shapes of 2-4 sets Venn use circles
		and ellipses, while the shapes of 4-7 sets Venn use irregular
		polygons (4 has both forms), which are developed and imported
		from another package 'venn', authored by Adrian Dusa. We
		provided internal functions to integrate shape data with user
		provided sets data, and calculated the geometry of every
		regions/intersections of them, then separately plot Venn in
		four components: set edges/labels, and region edges/labels.
		From version 1.0, it is possible to customize these components
		as you demand in ordinary 'ggplot2' grammar. From version
		1.4.4, it supports unlimited number of sets, as it can draw a
		plain upset plot automatically when number of sets is more than
		7.
