		Inference for Model-Free Between-Group Parameters for Censored
		Survival Data // Performs inference of several model-free group
		contrast measures, which include difference/ratio of cumulative
		incidence rates at given time points, quantiles, and restricted
		mean survival times (RMST). Two kinds of covariate adjustment
		procedures (i.e., regression and augmentation) for inference of
		the metrics based on RMST are also included.
