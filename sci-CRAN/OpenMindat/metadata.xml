		Quickly Retrieve Datasets from the 'mindat.org' API // 'Mindat'
		('mindat.org') is one of the world's most widely used databases
		of mineral species and their distribution. Many scientists in
		mineralogy, geochemistry, petrology, and other Earth and
		planetary disciplines have been using the 'Mindat' data. Still,
		an open data service and the machine interface have never been
		fully established. To meet the overwhelming data needs, the
		'Mindat' team has built an API
		(https://api.mindat.org/schema/redoc/) for data
		access.'OpenMindat' R package provides valuable functions to
		bridge the data highway, connecting users' data requirements to
		the 'Mindat' API server and assist with retrieval and initial
		processing to improve efficiency further and lower the barrier
		of data query and access to scientists. 'OpenMindat' provides
		friendly and extensible data retrieval functions, including the
		subjects of geomaterials (e.g., rocks, minerals, synonyms,
		variety, mixture, and commodity), localities, and the IMA
		(International Mineralogical Association)-approved mineral
		list. 'OpenMindat' R package will accelerate the process of
		data-intensive studies in mineral informatics and lead to more
		scientific discoveries.
