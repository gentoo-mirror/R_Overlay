		Interactive Genomic Visualization of Biological Data // Provides
		interactive, configurable and elegant graphics visualization of
		the chromosomes or chromosome regions of any living organism
		allowing users to map chromosome elements (like genes, SNPs
		etc.) on the chromosome plot. It introduces a special plot viz.
		the "chromosome heatmap" that, in addition to mapping elements,
		can visualize the data associated with chromosome elements
		(like gene expression) in the form of heat colors which can be
		highly advantageous in the scientific interpretations and
		research work. Because of the large size of the chromosomes, it
		is impractical to visualize each element on the same plot.
		However, the plot provides a magnified view for each of
		chromosome locus to render additional information and
		visualization specific for that location. You can map thousands
		of genes and can view all mappings easily. Users can
		investigate the detailed information about the mappings (like
		gene names or total genes mapped on a location) or can view the
		magnified single or double stranded view of the chromosome at a
		location showing each mapped element in sequential order. The
		package provide multiple features like visualizing multiple
		sets, chromosome heat-maps, group annotations, adding
		hyperlinks, and labelling. The plots can be saved as HTML
		documents that can be customized and shared easily. In
		addition, you can include them in R Markdown or in R 'Shiny'
		applications.
