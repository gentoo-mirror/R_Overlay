		Bivariate Probability Distributions // Provides alternatives to
		persp() for plotting bivariate functions, including both step
		and continuous functions. Also, provides convenience functions
		for constructing and plotting bivariate probability
		distributions. Currently, only normal distributions are
		supported but other probability distributions are likely to be
		added in the near future.
