		Permutation-Based Inference for Generalized Linear Models // In
		practical applications, the assumptions underlying generalized
		linear models frequently face violations, including incorrect
		specifications of the outcome variable's distribution or
		omitted predictors. These deviations can render the results of
		standard generalized linear models unreliable. As the sample
		size increases, what might initially appear as minor issues can
		escalate to critical concerns. To address these challenges, we
		adopt a permutation-based inference method tailored for
		generalized linear models. This approach offers robust
		estimations that effectively counteract the mentioned problems,
		and its effectiveness remains consistent regardless of the
		sample size.
