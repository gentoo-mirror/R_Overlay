		Standardized Accuracy and Other Model Performance Metrics //
		Standardized accuracy (staccuracy) is framework for expressing
		accuracy scores such that 50% represents a reference level of
		performance and 100% is perfect prediction. The 'staccuracy'
		package provides tools for creating staccuracy functions as
		well as some recommended staccuracy measures. It also provides
		functions for some classic performance metrics such as mean
		absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and area
		under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC), as
		well as their winsorized versions when applicable.
