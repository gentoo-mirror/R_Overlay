		Regression Modeling Strategies // Regression modeling, testing,
		estimation, validation, graphics, prediction, and typesetting
		by storing enhanced model design attributes in the fit.  'rms'
		is a collection of functions that assist with and streamline
		modeling.  It also contains functions for binary and ordinal
		logistic regression models, ordinal models for continuous Y
		with a variety of distribution families, and the Buckley-James
		multiple regression model for right-censored responses, and
		implements penalized maximum likelihood estimation for logistic
		and ordinary linear models.  'rms' works with almost any
		regression model, but it was especially written to work with
		binary or ordinal regression models, Cox regression,
		accelerated failure time models, ordinary linear models,
		the Buckley-James model, generalized least squares for serially
		or spatially correlated observations, generalized linear
		models, and quantile regression.
