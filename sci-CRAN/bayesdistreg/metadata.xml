		Bayesian Distribution Regression // Implements Bayesian
		Distribution Regression methods. This package contains
		functions for three estimators (non-asymptotic, semi-asymptotic
		and asymptotic) and related routines for Bayesian Distribution
		Regression in Huang and Tsyawo (2018) doi:10.2139/ssrn.3048658
		which is also the recommended reference to cite for this
		package. The functions can be grouped into three (3)
		categories. The first computes the logit likelihood function
		and posterior densities under uniform and normal priors. The
		second contains Independence and Random Walk Metropolis-
		Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms as
		functions and the third category of functions are useful for
		semi-asymptotic and asymptotic Bayesian distribution regression
		inference.
