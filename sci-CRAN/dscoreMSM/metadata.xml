		Survival Proximity Score Matching in Multi-State Survival Model
		// Implements survival proximity score matching in multi-state
		survival models. Includes tools for simulating survival data
		and estimating transition-specific coxph models with frailty
		terms. The primary methodological work on multistate censored
		data modeling using propensity score matching has been
		published by Bhattacharjee et al.(2024)
