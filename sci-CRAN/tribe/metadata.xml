		Play with the Tribe of Attributes // Functions to make
		manipulation of object attributes easier. It also contains a
		few functions that extend the 'dplyr' package for data
		manipulation, and it provides new pipe operators, including the
		pipe '%@%' similar to the 'magrittr' '%%', but with the
		additional functionality to enable attributes propagation.
