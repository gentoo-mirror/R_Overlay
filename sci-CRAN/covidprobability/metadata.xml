		Estimate the Unit-Wide Probability of COVID-19 // We propose a
		method to estimate the probability of an undetected case of
		COVID-19 in a defined setting, when a given number of people
		have been exposed, with a given pretest probability of having
		COVID-19 as a result of that exposure. Since we are interested
		in undetected COVID-19, we assume no person has developed
		symptoms (which would warrant further investigation) and that
		everyone was tested on a given day, and all tested negative.
