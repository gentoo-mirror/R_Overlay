		Kiener Distributions and Fat Tails in Finance and Neuroscience //
		Kiener distributions K1, K2, K3, K4 and K7 to characterize
		distributions with left and right, symmetric or asymmetric fat
		tails in finance, neuroscience and other disciplines. Two
		algorithms to estimate the distribution parameters, quantiles,
		value-at-risk and expected shortfall. IMPORTANT:
		Standardization has been changed in versions = 2.0.0 to get sd
		= 1 when kappa = Inf rather than 2*pi/sqrt(3) in versions =
		1.8.6. This affects parameter g (other parameters stay
		unchanged). Do not update if you need consistent comparisons
		with previous results for the g parameter.
