		Time Delay Estimation for Stochastic Time Series of
		Gravitationally Lensed Quasars // We provide a toolbox to
		estimate the time delay between the brightness time series of
		gravitationally lensed quasar images via Bayesian and profile
		likelihood approaches. The model is based on a state-space
		representation for  irregularly observed time series data
		generated from a latent continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
		process. Our Bayesian method adopts scientifically motivated
		hyper-prior distributions and a Metropolis-Hastings within
		Gibbs sampler, producing posterior samples of the model
		parameters that include the time delay. A profile likelihood of
		the time delay is a simple approximation to the marginal
		posterior distribution of the time delay. Both Bayesian and
		profile likelihood approaches complement each other, producing
		almost identical results; the Bayesian way is more principled
		but the profile likelihood is easier to implement. A new
		functionality is added in version 1.0.9 for estimating the time
		delay between doubly-lensed light curves observed in two bands.
