		Estimation with Penalisation in Systems of Ordinary Differential
		Equations // A set of statistical tools for inferring unknown
		parameters in continuous time processes governed by ordinary
		differential equations (ODE). Moreover, variance reduction and
		model selection can be obtained through various implemented
		penalisation schemes. The package offers two estimation
		procedures: exact estimation via least squares and a faster
		approximate estimation via inverse collocation methods. All
		estimators can handle multiple data sets arising from the same
		ODE system, but subjected to different interventions.
