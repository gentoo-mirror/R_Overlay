		Covariate Assisted Spectral Clustering on Ratios of Eigenvectors
		// Functions for implementing the novel algorithm CASCORE,
		which is designed to detect latent community structure in
		graphs with node covariates. This algorithm can handle models
		such as the covariate-assisted degree corrected stochastic
		block model (CADCSBM). CASCORE specifically addresses the
		disagreement between the community structure inferred from the
		adjacency information and the community structure inferred from
		the covariate information. For more detailed information,
		please refer to the reference paper: Yaofang Hu and Wanjie Wang
		(2022) arXiv:2306.15616. In addition to CASCORE, this package
		includes several classical community detection algorithms that
		are compared to CASCORE in our paper. These algorithms are:
		Spectral Clustering On Ratios-of Eigenvectors (SCORE),
		normalized PCA, ordinary PCA, network-based clustering,
		covariates-based clustering and covariate-assisted spectral
		clustering (CASC). By providing these additional algorithms,
		the package enables users to compare their performance with
		CASCORE in community detection tasks.
