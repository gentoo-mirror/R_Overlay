		Covariate Assisted Spectral Clustering on Ratios of Eigenvectors
		// Functions for the novel algorithm CASCORE, proposed to
		detect the latent community structure in graphs with node
		covariates. The models we can handle include covariate assisted
		degree corrected stochastic block model (CADCSBM). CASCORE
		allows for the disagreement between the community structure
		revealed in the adjacency information and the community
		structure revealed in the covariate information. More details
		are in the reference paper: Yaofang Hu and Wanjie Wang (2022)
		arXiv:2208.00257. This package also includes other classical
		community detection algorithms that are compared to CASCORE in
		our paper, such as Spectral Clustering On Ratios-of
		Eigenvectors (SCORE), normalized PCA, ordinary PCA and
		covariate-assisted spectral clustering (CASC) and ADMM.
