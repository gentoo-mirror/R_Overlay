		Estimating Hierarchical Linear Models for Single-Case Designs //
		Provides a set of tools for estimating hierarchical linear
		models and effect sizes based on data from single-case designs.
		Functions are provided for calculating standardized mean
		difference effect sizes that are directly comparable to
		standardized mean differences estimated from between-subjects
		randomized experiments, as described in Hedges, Pustejovsky,
		and Shadish (2012) DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1052; Hedges, Pustejovsky,
		and Shadish (2013) DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1086; Pustejovsky, Hedges,
		and Shadish (2014) DOI:10.3102/1076998614547577; and Chen,
		Pustejovsky, Klingbeil, and Van Norman (2023)
		DOI:10.1016/j.jsp.2023.02.002. Includes an interactive web
		interface.
