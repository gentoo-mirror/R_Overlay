		A Parallelized General-Purpose Optimization Based on Marquardt-
		Levenberg Algorithm // This algorithm provides a numerical
		solution to the problem of unconstrained local minimization (or
		maximization). It is particularly suited for complex problems
		and more efficient than the Gauss-Newton-like algorithm when
		starting from points very far from the final minimum (or
		maximum). Each iteration is parallelized and convergence relies
		on a stringent stopping criterion based on the first and second
		derivatives. See Philipps et al, 2021 doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-089.
