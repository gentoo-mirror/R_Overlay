		A Parallelized Algorithm for Least-Squares Curve Fitting // This
		algorithm provides a numerical solution to the problem of
		minimizing (or maximizing) a function. This is more efficient
		than the Gauss-Newton-like algorithm when starting from points
		very far from the final minimum (or maximum). A new convergence
		test is implemented (RDM) in addition to the usual stopping
		criterion : stopping rule is when the gradients are small
		enough in the parameters metric (GH-1G).
