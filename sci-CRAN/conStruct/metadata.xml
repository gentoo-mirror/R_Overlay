		Models Spatially Continuous and Discrete Population Genetic
		Structure // A method for modeling genetic data as a
		combination of discrete layers, within each of which
		relatedness may decay continuously with geographic distance.
		This package contains code for running analyses (which are
		implemented in the modeling language 'rstan') and visualizing
		and interpreting output. See the paper for more details on the
		model and its utility.
