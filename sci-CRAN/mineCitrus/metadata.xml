		Extract and Analyze Median Molecule Intensity from 'citrus'
		Output // Citrus is a computational technique developed for the
		analysis of high dimensional cytometry data sets. This package
		extracts, statistically analyzes, and visualizes marker
		expression from 'citrus' data. This code was used to generate
		data for Figures 3 and 4 in the forthcoming manuscript: Throm
		et al. Identification of Enhanced Interferon-Gamma Signaling in
		Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis with Mass
		Cytometry, JCI-Insight. For more information on Citrus, please
		see: Bruggner et al. (2014) doi:10.1073/pnas.1408792111. To
