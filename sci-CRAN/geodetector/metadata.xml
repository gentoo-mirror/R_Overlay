		Stratified Heterogeneity Measure, Dominant Driving Force
		Detection, Interaction Relationship Investigation // Spatial
		stratified heterogeneity (SSH), referring to the within strata
		are more similar than the between strata, a model with global
		parameters would be confounded if input data is SSH. Note that
		the "spatial" here can be either geospatial or the space in
		mathematical meaning. Geographical detector is a novel tool to
		investigate SSH: (1) measure and find SSH of a variable Y; (2)
		test the power of determinant X of a dependent variable Y
		according to the consistency between their spatial
		distributions; and (3) investigate the interaction between two
		explanatory variables X1 and X2 to a dependent variable Y (Wang
		et al 2014 doi:10.1080/13658810802443457, Wang, Zhang, and Fu
