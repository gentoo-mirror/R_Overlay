		'FASTA' ML and altall Sequences from IQ-TREE .state Files //
		Takes a .state file generated by IQ-TREE as an input and, for
		each ancestral node present in the file, generates a FASTA-
		formatted maximum likelihood (ML) sequence as well as an AltAll
		sequence in which uncertain sites, determined by the two
		parameters thres_1 and thres_2, have the maximum likelihood
		state swapped with the next most likely state as described in
		Geeta N. Eick, Jamie T. Bridgham, Douglas P. Anderson, Michael
		J. Harms, and Joseph W. Thornton (2017), "Robustness of
		Reconstructed Ancestral Protein Functions to Statistical
		Uncertainty" doi:10.1093/molbev/msw223.
