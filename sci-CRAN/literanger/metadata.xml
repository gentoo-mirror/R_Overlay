		Fast Serializable Random Forests Based on 'ranger' // An updated
		implementation of R package 'ranger' by Wright et al, (2017)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01 for training and predicting from
		random forests, particularly suited to high-dimensional data,
		and for embedding in 'Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations'
		(MICE) by van Buuren (2007) doi:10.1177/0962280206074463.
		Ensembles of classification and regression trees are currently
		supported. Sparse data of class 'dgCMatrix' (R package
		'Matrix') can be directly analyzed. Conventional bagged
		predictions are available alongside an efficient prediction for
		MICE via the algorithm proposed by Doove et al (2014)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.10.025. Trained forests can be written
		to and read from storage. Survival and probability forests are
		not supported in the update, nor is data of class 'gwaa.data'
		(R package 'GenABEL'); use the original 'ranger' package for
		these analyses.
