		Unsupervised Photometric Membership Assignment in Stellar
		Clusters // An implementation of the UPMASK method for
		performing membership assignment in stellar clusters in R. It
		is prepared to use photometry and spatial positions, but it can
		take into account other types of data. The method is able to
		take into account arbitrary error models, and it is
		unsupervised, data-driven, physical-model-free and relies on as
		few assumptions as possible. The approach followed for
		membership assessment is based on an iterative process,
		principal component analysis, a clustering algorithm and a
		kernel density estimation.
