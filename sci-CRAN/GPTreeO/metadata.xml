		Dividing Local Gaussian Processes for Online Learning Regression
		// We implement and extend the Dividing Local Gaussian Process
		algorithm by Lederer et al. (2020)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2006.09446. Its main use case is in online
		learning where it is used to train a network of local GPs
		(referred to as tree) by cleverly partitioning the input space.
		In contrast to a single GP, 'GPTreeO' is able to deal with
		larger amounts of data. The package includes methods to create
		the tree and set its parameter, incorporating data points from
		a data stream as well as making joint predictions based on all
		relevant local GPs.
