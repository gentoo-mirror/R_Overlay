		Analyzing Partial Rankings in Networks // Implements methods for
		centrality related analyses of networks. While the package
		includes the possibility to build more than 20 indices, its
		main focus lies on index-free assessment of centrality via
		partial rankings obtained by neighborhood-inclusion or
		positional dominance. These partial rankings can be analyzed
		with different methods, including probabilistic methods like
		computing expected node ranks and relative rank probabilities
		(how likely is it that a node is more central than another?).
		The methodology is described in depth in the vignettes and in
		Schoch (2018) doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2017.12.003.
