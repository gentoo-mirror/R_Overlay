		Artificial Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection // Training of
		general classification and regression neural networks using
		gradient descent. Special features include a function for
		training autoencoders as well as an implementation of
		replicator neural networks, for details see Hawkins et al.
		(2012) doi:10.1007/3-540-46145-0_17. Multiple activation and
		cost functions (including Huber and pseudo-Huber) are included,
		as well as L1 and L2 regularization, momentum, early stopping
		and the possibility to specify a learning rate schedule. The
		package contains a vectorized gradient descent implementation
		which facilitates faster training through batch learning.
