		Artificial Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection // Training of
		neural networks for classification and regression tasks using
		mini-batch gradient descent. Special features include a
		function for training autoencoders, which can be used to detect
		anomalies, and some related plotting functions. Multiple
		activation functions are supported, including tanh, relu, step
		and ramp. For the use of the step and ramp activation functions
		in detecting anomalies using autoencoders, see Hawkins et al.
		(2002) doi:10.1007/3-540-46145-0_17. Furthermore, several loss
		functions are supported, including robust ones such as Huber
		and pseudo-Huber loss, as well as L1 and L2 regularization. The
		possible options for optimization algorithms are RMSprop, Adam
		and SGD with momentum. The package contains a vectorized C++
		implementation that facilitates fast training through mini-
		batch learning.
