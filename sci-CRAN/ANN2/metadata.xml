		Artificial Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection // Training of
		general classification and regression neural networks using
		gradient descent. Special features include a function for
		training replicator neural networks and a function for training
		autoencoders. Multiple activation and cost functions (including
		Huber and pseudo-Huber) are supported, as well as L1 and L2
		regularization, momentum, early stopping and the possibility to
		specify a learning rate schedule. The package contains a
		vectorized gradient descent implementation which facilitates
		faster training through batch learning.
