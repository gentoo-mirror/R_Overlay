		Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Propagation Across Multiple Scales //
		Integrated environmental modelling requires coupling sub-models
		at different spatial and temporal scales, thus accounting for
		change of support procedures (aggregation and disaggregation).
		We contribute to state-of-the-art open source tools that
		support uncertainty propagation analysis in temporal and
		spatio-temporal domains. We implement the tool for uncertainty
		propagation in environmental modelling, with examples in the
		urban water domain. The functionalities of the class setup and
		the methods and functions MC.setup, MC.sim, MC.analysis and
		Agg.t are contained, which are used for setting up, running and
		analysing Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation simulations, and
		for spatio-temporal aggregation. We also implement
		functionalities to model and predict variables that vary in
		space and time. stUPscales takes uncertainty characterisation
		and propagation a step further by including temporal and
		spatio-temporal auto- and cross-correlation, resulting in more
		realistic (spatio-)temporal series of environmental variables.
		Due to its modularity, the package allows the implementation of
		additional methods and functions for spatio-temporal
		disaggregation of model inputs and outputs, when linking models
		across multiple space-time scales.
