		Connected Components of an Undirected Graph // Provides a
		function for fast computation of the connected components of an
		undirected graph (though not faster than the components()
		function of the 'igraph' package) from the edges or the
		adjacency matrix of the graph. Based on this one, a function to
		compute the connected components of a triangle 'rgl' mesh is
		also provided.
