		Statistical Inference and Prediction of Annotations in
		Phylogenetic Trees // Implements a parsimonious evolutionary
		model to analyze and predict gene-functional annotations in
		phylogenetic trees as described in Vega Yon et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007948. With a focus on computational
		efficiency, 'aphylo' makes it possible to estimate pooled
		phylogenetic models, including thousands (hundreds) of
		annotations (trees) in the same run. The package also provides
		the tools for visualization of annotated phylogenies,
		calculation of posterior probabilities (prediction,) and
		goodness-of-fit assessment featured in Vega Yon et al. (2021).
