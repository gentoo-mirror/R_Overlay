		Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Peak Detection in ChIP-Seq Data
		// A quadratic time dynamic programming algorithm can be used
		to compute an approximate solution to the problem of finding
		the most likely changepoints with respect to the Poisson
		likelihood, subject to a constraint on the number of segments,
		and the changes which must alternate: up, down, up, down, etc.
		For more info read

		constrained optimal segmentation and supervised penalty
		learning for peak detection in count data" by TD Hocking et al,
		proceedings of ICML2015.
