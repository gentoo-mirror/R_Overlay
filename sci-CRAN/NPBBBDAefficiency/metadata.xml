		A-Efficiency for Nested Partially Balanced Bipartite Block
		(NPBBB) Designs // Nested Partially Balanced Bipartite Block
		(NPBBB) designs involve two levels of blocking: (i) The block
		design (ignoring sub-block classification) serves as a
		partially balanced bipartite block (PBBB) design, and (ii) The
		sub-block design (ignoring block classification) also serves as
		a PBBB design. More details on constructions of the PBBB
		designs and their characterization properties are available in
		Vinayaka et al.(2023) doi:10.1080/03610926.2023.2251623. This
		package calculates A-efficiency values for both block and sub-
		block structures, along with all parameters of a given NPBBB
		design.
