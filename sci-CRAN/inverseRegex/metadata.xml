		Reverse Engineers Regular Expression Patterns for R Objects //
		Reverse engineer a regular expression pattern for the
		characters contained in an R object. Individual characters can
		be categorised into digits, letters, punctuation or spaces and
		encoded into run-lengths. This can be used to summarise the
		structure of a dataset or identify non-standard entries. Many
		non-character inputs such as numeric vectors and data frames
		are supported.
