		Funnel Plots for Proportion Data // A set of simplified functions
		for creating funnel plots for proportion data. This package
		supports user defined benchmarks, confidence limits and
		estimation methods (i.e. exact or approximate) based on
		Spiegelhalter (2005) doi:10.1002/sim.1970. Additional routines
		for returning scored unit level data according to a set of
		specifications is also implemented for convenience.
		Specifically, both a categorical and a continuous score
		variable is returned to the sample data frame, which identifies
		which observations are deemed extreme or in control. Typically,
		such variables are useful as stratifications or covariates in
		further exploratory analyses. Lastly, the plotting routine
		returns a base funnel plot ('ggplot2'), which can also be
		tailored.
