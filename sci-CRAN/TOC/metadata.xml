		Total Operating Characteristic Curve and ROC Curve //
		Construction of the Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) Curve
		and the Receiver (aka Relative) Operating Characteristic (ROC)
		Curve for spatial and non-spatial data. The TOC method is a
		modification of the ROC method which measures the ability of an
		index variable to diagnose either presence or absence of a
		characteristic. The diagnosis depends on whether the value of
		an index variable is above a threshold. Each threshold
		generates a two-by-two contingency table, which contains four
		entries: hits (H), misses (M), false alarms (FA), and correct
		rejections (CR). While ROC shows for each threshold only two
		ratios, H/(H + M) and FA/(FA + CR), TOC reveals the size of
		every entry in the contingency table for each threshold
