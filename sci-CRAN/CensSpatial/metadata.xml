		Censored Spatial Models // It fits linear regression models for
		censored spatial data. It provides different estimation methods
		as the SAEM (Stochastic Approximation of Expectation
		Maximization) algorithm and seminaive that uses Kriging
		prediction to estimate the response at censored locations and
		predict new values at unknown locations. It also offers
		graphical tools for assessing the fitted model.
