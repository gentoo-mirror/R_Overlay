		Censored Spatial Models // Fits linear regression models for
		censored spatial data. Provides different estimation methods as
		the SAEM (Stochastic Approximation of Expectation Maximization)

		estimate the response at censored locations and predict new
		values at unknown locations. Also offers graphical tools for
		assessing the fitted model.
