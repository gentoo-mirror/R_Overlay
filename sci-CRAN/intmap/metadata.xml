		Ordered Containers with Integer Keys // Provides a key-value
		store data structure. The keys are integers and the values can
		be any R object. This is like a list but indexed by a set of
		integers, not necessarily contiguous and possibly negative. The
		implementation uses a 'R6' class. These containers are not
		faster than lists but their usage can be more convenient for
		certain situations.
