		Clustering of Genomic Regions Analysis Method // Provides a new
		method for identification of clusters of genomic regions within
		chromosomes. Primarily, it is used for calling clusters of cis-
		regulatory elements (COREs). 'CREAM' uses genome-wide maps of
		genomic regions in the tissue or cell type of interest, such as
		those generated from chromatin-based assays including DNaseI,
		ATAC or ChIP-Seq. 'CREAM' considers proximity of the elements
		within chromosomes of a given sample to identify COREs in the
		following steps: 1) It identifies window size or the maximum
		allowed distance between the elements within each CORE, 2) It
		identifies number of elements which should be clustered as a
		CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters the COREs with lowest
		order which does not pass the threshold considered in the
		approach.
