		Optimal B-Robust Estimator Tools // An implementation for
		computing Optimal B-Robust Estimators (OBRE) of two parameters
		distributions. The procedure is composed by some equations that
		are evaluated alternatively until the solution is reached. Some
		tools for analyzing the estimates are included. The most
		relevant is OBRE covariance matrix computation using a closed
		formula.
