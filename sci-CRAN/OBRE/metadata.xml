		Optimal B-Robust Estimator Tools // An implementation for
		computing Optimal B-Robust Estimators of two-parameter
		distribution. The procedure is composed of some equations that
		are evaluated alternatively until the solution is reached. Some
		tools for analyzing the estimates are included. The most
		relevant is covariance matrix computation using a closed
		formula.
