		ESEA: Discovering the Dysregulated Pathways based on Edge Set
		Enrichment Analysis // The package can identify the
		dysregulated canonical pathways by investigating the changes of
		biological relationships of pathways in the context of gene
		expression data. (1) The ESEA package constructs a background
		set of edges by extracting pathway structure (e.g. interaction,
		regulation, modification, and binding etc.) from the seven
		public databases (KEGG; Reactome; Biocarta; NCI; SPIKE;
		HumanCyc; Panther) and the edge sets of pathways for each of
		the above databases. (2) The ESEA package can can quantify the
		change of correlation between genes for each edge based on gene
		expression data with cases and controls. (3) The ESEA package
		uses the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to calculate an
		edge enrichment score (EES), which reflects the degree to which
		a given pathway is associated the specific phenotype. (4) The
		ESEA package can provide the visualization of the results.
