		A Collection of Tools for the Analysis of Remote Acoustic
		Telemetry Data // Designed to facilitate the assimilation,
		analysis and synthesis of animal location and movement data
		collected by the VEMCO suite of acoustic transmitters and
		receivers. As well as database and geographic information
		capabilities the principal feature of VTrack is the
		qualification and identification of ecologically relevant
		events from the acoustic detection and sensor data. This
		procedure condenses the acoustic detection database by orders
		of magnitude, greatly enhancing the synthesis of acoustic
		detection data.
