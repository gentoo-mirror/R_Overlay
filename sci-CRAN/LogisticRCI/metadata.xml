		Linear and Logistic Regression-Based Reliable Change Index //
		Here we provide an implementation of the linear and logistic
		regression-based Reliable Change Index (RCI), to be used with
		lm and binomial glm model objects, respectively, following
		Moral et al. https://psyarxiv.com/gq7az/. The RCI function
		returns a score assumed to be approximately normally
		distributed, which is helpful to detect patients that may
		present cognitive decline.
