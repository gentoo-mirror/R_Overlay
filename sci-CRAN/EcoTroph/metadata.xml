		EcoTroph R package // EcoTroph is an approach and software for
		modelling marine and freshwater ecosystems. It is articulated
		entirely around trophic levels. EcoTroph's key displays are
		bivariate plots, with trophic levels as the abscissa, and
		biomass flows or related quantities as ordinates. Thus, trophic
		ecosystem functioning can be modelled as a continuous flow of
		biomass surging up the food web, from lower to higher trophic
		levels, due to predation and ontogenic processes. Such an
		approach, wherein species as such disappear, may be viewed as
		the ultimate stage in the use of the trophic level metric for
		ecosystem modelling, providing a simplified but potentially
		useful caricature of ecosystem functioning and impacts of
		fishing. This version contains catch trophic spectrum analysis
		(CTSA) function and corrected versions of the mf.diagnosis and
		create.ETmain functions.
