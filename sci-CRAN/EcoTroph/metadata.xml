		An Implementation of the EcoTroph Ecosystem Modelling Approach //
		An approach and software for modelling marine and freshwater
		ecosystems. It is articulated entirely around trophic levels.
		EcoTroph's key displays are bivariate plots, with trophic
		levels as the abscissa, and biomass flows or related quantities
		as ordinates. Thus, trophic ecosystem functioning can be
		modelled as a continuous flow of biomass surging up the food
		web, from lower to higher trophic levels, due to predation and
		ontogenic processes. Such an approach, wherein species as such
		disappear, may be viewed as the ultimate stage in the use of
		the trophic level metric for ecosystem modelling, providing a
		simplified but potentially useful caricature of ecosystem
		functioning and impacts of fishing. This version contains catch
		trophic spectrum analysis (CTSA) function and corrected
		versions of the mf.diagnosis and create.ETmain functions.
