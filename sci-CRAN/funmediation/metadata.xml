		Functional Mediation for a Distal Outcome // Fits a functional
		mediation model with a scalar distal outcome. The method is
		described in detail by Coffman, Dziak, Litson, Chakraborti,
		Piper  Li (2021) arXiv:2112.03960. The model is similar to that
		of Lindquist (2012) doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.695640 although
		allowing a binary outcome as an alternative to a numerical
		outcome.  The current version is a minor bug fix in the
		vignette. The development of this package was part of a
		research project supported by National Institutes of Health
		grants P50 DA039838 from the National Institute of Drug Abuse
		and 1R01 CA229542-01 from the National Cancer Institute and the
		NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research. Content
