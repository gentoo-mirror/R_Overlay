		Using Block Model to Estimate the Robustness of Ecological
		Network // Implementation of a variety of methods to compute
		the robustness of ecological interaction networks with binary
		interactions as described in doi:10.1002/env.2709. In
		particular, using the Stochastic Block Model and its bipartite
		counterpart, the Latent Block Model to put a parametric model
		on the network, allows the comparison of the robustness of
		networks differing in species richness and number of
		interactions. It also deals with networks that are partially
		sampled and/or with missing values.
