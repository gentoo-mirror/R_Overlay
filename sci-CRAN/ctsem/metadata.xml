		Continuous Time Structural Equation Modelling // Hierarchical
		continuous (and discrete) time state space modelling, for
		linear and nonlinear systems measured by  continuous variables,
		with limited support for binary data. The subject specific
		dynamic system is modelled as a stochastic differential
		equation (SDE) or difference equation, measurement models are
		typically multivariate normal factor models. Linear mixed
		effects SDE's estimated via maximum likelihood and optimization
		are the default. Nonlinearities,  (state dependent parameters)
		and random effects on all parameters are possible, using either
		max likelihood / max a posteriori optimization (with optional
		importance sampling) or Stan's Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
		sampling. See  https://github.com/cdriveraus/ctsem/raw/master/v
		ignettes/hierarchicalmanual.pdf for details. Priors may be
		used. For the conceptual overview of the hierarchical Bayesian
		linear SDE approach, see https://www.researchgate.net/publicati
		on/324093594_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Continuous_Time_Dynamic_Mode
		ling. Exogenous inputs may also be included, for an overview of
		such possibilities see https://www.researchgate.net/publication
		/328221807_Understanding_the_Time_Course_of_Interventions_with_
		Continuous_Time_Dynamic_Models . Stan based functions are not
		available on 32 bit Windows systems at present.
