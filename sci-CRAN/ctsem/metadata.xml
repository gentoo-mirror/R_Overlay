		Continuous Time Structural Equation Modelling // A hierarchical,
		multivariate, continuous (and discrete) time dynamic modelling
		package for panel and time series data, using stochastic
		differential equations. Contains a faster frequentist set of
		functions using OpenMx for single subject and mixed-effects
		(random intercepts only) structural equation models, or a
		hierarchical Bayesian implementation using Stan that allows for
		random effects and non-linearity over all model parameters.
		Allows for modelling of multiple noisy measurements of multiple
		stochastic processes, time varying input / event covariates,
		and time invariant covariates used to predict the parameters.
		Bayesian formulation not available on 32 bit Windows systems.
