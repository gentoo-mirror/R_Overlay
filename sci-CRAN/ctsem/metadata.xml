		Continuous Time Structural Equation Modelling // Hierarchical
		continuous time state space modelling, for linear and nonlinear
		systems measured by  continuous variables, with limited support
		for binary data. The subject specific dynamic system is
		modelled as a stochastic differential equation (SDE),
		measurement models are typically multivariate normal factor
		models. Using the original ctsem formulation based on OpenMx,
		described in the JSS paper "Continuous Time Structural Equation
		Modeling with R Package ctsem", with updated version as CRAN
		vignette https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ctsem/vignette
		s/ctsem.pdf , linear mixed effects SDE's estimated via maximum
		likelihood and optimization are possible. Using the Stan based
		formulation, described in https://www.researchgate.net/publicat
		ion/310747987_Introduction_to_Hierarchical_Continuous_Time_Dyna
		mic_Modelling_With_ctsem , nonlinearity (state dependent
		parameters) and random effects on all parameters are possible,
		using either optimization (with optional importance sampling)
		or Stan's Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Priors may be used.
		For the conceptual overview of the hierarchical Bayesian linear
		SDE approach, see https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3240
