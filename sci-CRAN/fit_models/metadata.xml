		Compare Fitted Models // The fit.models function and its
		associated methods (coefficients, print, summary, plot, etc.)
		were originally provided in the robust package to compare
		robustly and classically fitted model objects. See chapters 2,
		3, and 5 in Insightful (2002) 'Robust Library User's Guide'
		http://robust.r-forge.r-project.org/Robust.pdf). The aim of the
		fit.models package is to separate this fitted model object
		comparison functionality from the robust package and to extend
		it to support fitting methods (e.g., classical, robust,
		Bayesian, regularized, etc.) more generally.
