		Variable Selection for Gaussian Model-Based Clustering //
		Variable selection for Gaussian model-based clustering as
		implemented in the 'mclust' package. The methodology allows to
		find the (locally) optimal subset of variables in a data set
		that have group/cluster information. A greedy or headlong
		search can be used, either in a forward-backward or backward-
		forward direction, with or without sub-sampling at the
		hierarchical clustering stage for starting 'mclust' models. By
		default the algorithm uses a sequential search, but
		parallelisation is also available.
