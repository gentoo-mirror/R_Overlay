		Causal Mediation Analysis Using Weighting Approach // We
		implement causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed
		by Hong (2010) and Hong, Deutsch  Hill (2015)
		doi:10.3102/1076998615583902. It allows the estimation and
		hypothesis testing of causal mediation effects through ratio of
		mediator probability weights (RMPW). This strategy conveniently
		relaxes the assumption of no treatment-by-mediator interaction
		while greatly simplifying the outcome model specification
		without invoking strong distributional assumptions. We also
		implement a sensitivity analysis by extending the RMPW method
		to assess potential bias in the presence of omitted
		pretreatment or posttreatment covariates. The sensitivity
		analysis strategy was proposed by Hong, Qin, and Yang (2018)
		doi:10.3102/1076998617749561.
