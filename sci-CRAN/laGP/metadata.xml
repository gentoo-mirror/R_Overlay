		Local Approximate Gaussian Process Regression // Performs
		approximate GP regression for large computer experiments and
		spatial datasets.  The approximation is based on finding small
		local designs for prediction (independently) at particular
		inputs. OpenMP and SNOW parallelization are supported for
		prediction over a vast out-of-sample testing set; GPU
		acceleration is also supported for an important subroutine.
		OpenMP and GPU features may require special compilation.  An
		interface to lower-level (full) GP inference and prediction is
		provided. Wrapper routines for blackbox optimization under
		mixed equality and inequality constraints via an augmented
		Lagrangian scheme, and for large scale computer model
		calibration, are also provided.  For details and tutorial, see
		Gramacy (2016 doi:10.18637/jss.v072.i01.
