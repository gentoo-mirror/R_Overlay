		Regions of Common Profiles Modelling with Mixtures-of-Experts //
		Identifies regions of common (species) profiles (RCPs),
		possibly when sampling artefacts are present.  Within a region
		the probability of sampling all species remains approximately
		constant.  This is performed using mixtures-of-experts models.
		The package also contains associated methods, such as
		diagnostics. Details of the method can be found in Foster et al
		(2013) doi:10.1002/env.2245 and Foster et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1111/rssc.12211.
