		Educational Assessment Tools for Replication Methods //
		Replication methods to compute some basic statistic operations
		(means, standard deviations, frequency tables, percentiles,
		mean comparisons using weighted effect coding, generalized
		linear models, and linear multilevel models) in complex survey
		designs comprising multiple imputed or nested imputed variables
		and/or a clustered sampling structure which both deserve
		special procedures at least in estimating standard errors. See
		the package documentation for a more detailed description along
		with references.
