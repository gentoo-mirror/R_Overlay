		Educational Assessment Tools for Replication Methods //
		Replication methods to compute some basic statistic operations
		(means, standard deviations, frequency tables, percentiles and
		generalized linear models) in complex survey designs comprising
		multiple imputed variables and/or a clustered sampling
		structure which both deserve special procedures at least in
		estimating standard errors. See the package documentation for a
		more detailed description along with references.
