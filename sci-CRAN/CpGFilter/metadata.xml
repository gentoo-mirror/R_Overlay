		CpG Filtering Method Based on Intra-class Correlation
		Coefficients // Filter CpGs based on Intra-class Correlation
		Coefficients (ICCs) when replicates are available. ICCs are
		calculated by fitting linear mixed effects models to all
		samples including the un-replicated samples. Including the
		large number of un-replicated samples improves ICC estimates
		dramatically. The method accommodates any replicate design.
