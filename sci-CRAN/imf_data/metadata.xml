		An Interface to IMF (International Monetary Fund) Data JSON API
		// A straightforward interface for accessing the IMF
		(International Monetary Fund) data JSON API, available at
		https://data.imf.org/. This package offers direct access to the
		primary API endpoints: Dataflow, DataStructure, and
		CompactData. And, it provides an intuitive interface for
		exploring available dimensions and attributes, as well as
		querying individual time-series datasets. Additionally, the
		package implements a rate limit on API calls to reduce the
		chances of exceeding service limits (limited to 10 calls every
		5 seconds) and encountering response errors.
