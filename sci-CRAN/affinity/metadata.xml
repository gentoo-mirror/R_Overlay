		Raster Georeferencing, Grid Affine Transforms, Cell Abstraction
		// Tools for raster georeferencing, grid affine transforms, and
		general raster logic. These functions provide converters
		between raster specifications, world vector, geotransform,
		'RasterIO' window, and 'RasterIO window' in 'sf' package list
		format. There are functions to offset a matrix by padding any
		of four corners (useful for vectorizing neighbourhood
		operations), and helper functions to harvesting user clicks on
		a graphics device to use for simple georeferencing of images.
		Methods used are available from
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_file and
		https://gdal.org/user/raster_data_model.html.
