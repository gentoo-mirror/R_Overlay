		Robust Model Fitting Using the RANSAC Algorithm // Provides tools
		for robust regression model fitting using the RANSAC (Random
		Sample Consensus) algorithm. RANSAC is an iterative method to
		estimate parameters of a model from a dataset that contains
		outliers. This package allows fitting both linear lm and
		nonlinear nls models using RANSAC, helping users obtain more
		reliable models in the presence of noisy or corrupted data. The
		methods are particularly useful in contexts where traditional
		least squares regression fails due to the influence of
		outliers. Implementations include support for performance
		metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R based on the inlier subset.
		For further details, see Fischler and Bolles (1981)
