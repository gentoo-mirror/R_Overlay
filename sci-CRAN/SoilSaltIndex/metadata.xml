		Soil Salinity Indices Generation using Satellite Data // The
		developed function generates soil salinity indices using
		satellite data, utilizing multiple spectral bands such as Blue,
		Green, Red, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR1,
		SWIR2). It computes 24 different salinity indices crucial for
		monitoring and analyzing salt-affected soils efficiently. For
		more details see, Rani, et al. (2022). DOI:
		10.1007/s12517-022-09682-3. One of the key features of the
		developed function is its flexibility. Users can provide any
		combination of the required spectral bands, and the function
		will automatically calculate only the relevant indices based on
		the available data. This dynamic capability ensures that users
		can maximize the utility of their data without the need for all
		spectral bands, making the package versatile and user-friendly.
		Outputs are provided as GeoTIFF file format, facilitating easy
		integration with GIS workflows.
