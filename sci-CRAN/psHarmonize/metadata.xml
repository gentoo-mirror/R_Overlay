		Creates a Harmonized Dataset Based on a Set of Instructions //
		Functions which facilitate harmonization of data from multiple
		different datasets. Data harmonization involves taking data
		sources with differing values, creating coding instructions to
		create a harmonized set of values, then making those data
		modifications. 'psHarmonize' will assist with data modification
		once the harmonization instructions are written. Coding
		instructions are written by the user to create a "harmonization
		sheet". This sheet catalogs variable names, domains (e.g.
		clinical, behavioral, outcomes), provides R code instructions
		for mapping or conversion of data, specifies the variable name
		in the harmonized data set, and tracks notes. The package will
		then harmonize the source datasets according to the
		harmonization sheet to create a harmonized dataset. Once
		harmonization is finished, the package also has functions that
		will create descriptive statistics using 'RMarkdown'. Data
		Harmonization guidelines have been described by Fortier I,
		Raina P, Van den Heuvel ER, et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1093/ije/dyw075. Additional details of our R package
		have been described by Stephen JJ, Carolan P, Krefman AE, et
		al. (2024) doi:10.1016/j.patter.2024.101003.
