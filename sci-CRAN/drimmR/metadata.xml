		Estimation, Simulation and Reliability of Drifting Markov Models
		// Performs the drifting Markov models (DMM) which are non-
		homogeneous Markov models designed for modeling the
		heterogeneities of sequences in a more flexible way than
		homogeneous Markov chains or even hidden Markov models. In this
		context, we developed an R package dedicated to the estimation,
		simulation and the exact computation of associated reliability
		of drifting Markov models. The implemented methods are
		described in Vergne, N. (2008), doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1326 and
		Barbu, V.S., Vergne, N. (2019) doi:10.1007/s11009-018-9682-8 .
