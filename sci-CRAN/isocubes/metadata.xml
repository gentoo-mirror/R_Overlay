		Voxel Data Visualization with Isometric Cubes // A voxel is a
		representation of a value on a regular, three-dimensional grid;
		it is the 3D equivalent of a 2D pixel.  Voxel data can be
		visualised with this package using fixed viewpoint isometric
		cubes for each data point. This package also provides sample
		voxel data and tools for transforming the data.
