		Bayesian Analysis of DSD // Definitive Screening Designs are a
		class of experimental designs that under factor sparsity have
		the potential to estimate linear, quadratic and interaction
		effects with little experimental effort. BAYESDEF is a package
		that performs a five step strategy to analyze this kind of
		experiments that makes use of tools coming from the Bayesian
		approach. It also includes the least absolute shrinkage and
		selection operator (lasso) as a check (Aguirre VM. (2016)
		DOI:10.1002/asmb.2160).
