		One-Sample Log-Rank Test // The log-rank test is performed to
		assess the survival outcomes between two group. When there is
		no proper control group or obtaining such data is cumbersome,
		one sample log-rank test can be applied. This package performs
		one sample log-rank test as described in Finkelstein et al.
		(2003)doi:10.1093/jnci/djt227 and variation of the test for
		small sample sizes which is detailed in FD Liddell
		(1984)doi:10.1136/jech.38.1.85 paper. Visualization function in
		the package generates Kaplan-Meier Curve comparing survival
		curve of the general population against that of the population
		of interest.
