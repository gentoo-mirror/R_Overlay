		Empirically Informed Random Trajectory Generation in 3-D //
		Creates realistic random trajectories in a 3-D space between
		two given fix points, so-called conditional empirical random
		walks (CERWs). The trajectory generation is based on empirical
		distribution functions extracted from observed trajectories
		(training data) and thus reflects the geometrical movement
		characteristics of the mover. A digital elevation model (DEM),
		representing the Earth's surface, and a background layer of
		probabilities (e.g. food sources, uplift potential,
		waterbodies, etc.) can be used to influence the trajectories.
