		Fuzzy and Non-Fuzzy Classifiers // It provides classifiers which
		can be used for discrete variables and for continuous variables
		based on the Naive Bayes and Fuzzy Naive Bayes hypothesis.
		Those methods were developed by researchers belong to the
		'Laboratory of Technologies for Virtual Teaching and Statistics
		(LabTEVE)' (http://www.de.ufpb.br/~labteve/) and 'Laboratory of
		Applied Statistics to Image Processing and Geoprocessing
		(LEAPIG)' (http://www.de.ufpb.br/~leapig/) at 'Federal
		University of Paraiba, Brazil'. They considered some
		statistical distributions and their papers were published in
		the scientific literature, as for instance, the Gaussian
		classifier using fuzzy parameters, proposed by 'Moraes,
		Ferreira and Machado' (2021) doi:10.1007/s40815-020-00936-4.
