		Simulation Tools for Planning Vitamin D Studies // Simulation
		tools for planning Vitamin D studies including approximation of
		power. Individual vitamin D status profiles are simulated,
		modelling population heterogeneity. Individuals experience
		random exposures to infectious              agents. Development
		of infection considers a heterogeneous treatment effect. This
		is incorporated into the power approximation.
