		Snow Profile Alignment, Aggregation, and Clustering // Snow
		profiles describe the vertical (1D) stratigraphy of layered
		snow with different layer characteristics, such as grain type,
		hardness, deposition date, and many more. Hence, they represent
		a data format similar to multivariate time series containing
		categorical, ordinal, and numerical data types. Use this
		package to align snow profiles by matching their individual
		layers based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The aligned
		profiles can then be assessed with an independent, global
		similarity measure that is geared towards avalanche hazard
		assessment. Finally, through exploiting data aggregation and
		clustering methods, the similarity measure provides the
		foundation for grouping and summarizing snow profiles according
		to similar hazard conditions. For more background information
		refer to Herla, Horton, and Haegeli (accepted)
