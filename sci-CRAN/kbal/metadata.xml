		Kernel Balancing // Provides a weighting approach that employs
		kernels to make one group have a similar distribution to
		another group on covariates. This method matches not only means
		or marginal distributions but also higher-order transformations
		implied by the choice of kernel. 'kbal' is applicable to both
		treatment effect estimation and survey reweighting problems.
		Based on Hazlett, C. (2020) "Kernel Balancing: A flexible non-
		parametric weighting procedure for estimating causal effects."
