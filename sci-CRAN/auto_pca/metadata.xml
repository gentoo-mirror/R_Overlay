		Automatic Variable Reduction Using Principal Component Analysis
		// PCA done by eigenvalue decomposition of a data correlation
		matrix, here it automatically determines the number of factors
		by eigenvalue greater than 1 and it gives the uncorrelated
		variables based on the rotated component scores, Such that in
		each principal component variable which has the high variance
		are selected. It will be useful for non-statisticians in
		selection of variables. For more information, see the
		http://www.ijcem.org/papers032013/ijcem_032013_06.pdf web page.
