		Network Analysis of Dependencies of CRAN Packages // The
		dependencies of CRAN packages can be analysed in a network
		fashion. For each package we can obtain the packages that it
		depends, imports, suggests, etc. By iterating this procedure
		over a number of packages, we can build, visualise, and analyse
		the dependency network, enabling us to have a bird's-eye view
		of the CRAN ecosystem. One aspect of interest is the number of
		reverse dependencies of the packages, or equivalently the in-
		degree distribution of the dependency network. This can be
		fitted by the power law and/or an extreme value mixture
		distribution doi:10.1111/stan.12355, of which functions are
		provided.
