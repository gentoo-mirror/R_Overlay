		Network Analysis of Dependencies of CRAN Packages // The
		dependencies of CRAN packages can be analysed in a network
		fashion. Through scrapping the page of a package on CRAN, we
		can obtain the packages that it depends, imports, suggests,
		etc. By iterating this procedure over a number of packages, we
		can build the dependency network and represent it by a graph
		object, most easily through the 'igraph' package. Subsequently,
		the dependency network can be visualised and analysed using
		social network analysis methods, enabling us to have a
		bird's-eye view of the CRAN ecosystem.
