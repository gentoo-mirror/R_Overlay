		Preprocessing Algorithms for Imbalanced Datasets // Algorithms to
		treat imbalanced datasets. Imbalanced datasets usually damage
		the performance of the classifiers. Thus, it is important to
		treat data before applying a classifier algorithm. This package
		includes recent preprocessing algorithms in the literature.
