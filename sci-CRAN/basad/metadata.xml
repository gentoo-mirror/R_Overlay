		Bayesian Variable Selection with Shrinking and Diffusing Priors
		// Provides a Bayesian variable selection approach using
		continuous spike and slab prior distributions. The prior
		choices here are motivated by the shrinking and diffusing
		priors studied in Narisetty  He (2014) DOI:10.1214/14-AOS1207.
