		Analysis of Designed High-Dimensional Data using the
		Comprehensive MultANOVA Framework // A comprehensive and
		computationally fast framework to analyze high dimensional data
		associated with an experimental design based on Multiple ANOVAs
		(MultANOVA). It includes testing the overall significance of
		terms in the model, post-hoc analyses of significant terms and
		variable selection. Details may be found in Mahieu, B.,
		Cariou, V. (2025). MultANOVA Followed by Post Hoc Analyses for
		Designed HighDimensional Data: A Comprehensive Framework That
		Outperforms ASCA, rMANOVA, and VASCA. Journal of Chemometrics,
		39(7). doi:10.1002/cem.70039.
