		A Grammar of Graphics for Comparative Genomics // An extension of
		'ggplot2' for creating complex genomic maps. It builds on the
		power of 'ggplot2' and 'tidyverse' adding new 'ggplot2'-style
		geoms  positions and 'dplyr'-style verbs to manipulate the
		underlying data. It implements a layout concept inspired by
		'ggraph' and introduces tracks to bring tidiness to the mess
		that is genomics data.
