		Nonparametric Tests for Incomplete Clustered Data //
		Nonparametric tests for clustered data in pre-post intervention
		design documented in Cui and Harrar (2021)
		doi:10.1002/bimj.201900310 and Harrar and Cui (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2022.05.009. Other than the main test
		results mentioned in the reference paper, this package also
		provides a function to calculate the sample size allocations
		for the input long format data set, and also a function for
		adjusted/unadjusted confidence intervals calculations. There
		are also functions to visualize the distribution of data across
		different intervention groups over time, and also the
		adjusted/unadjusted confidence intervals.
