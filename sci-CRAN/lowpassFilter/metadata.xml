		Lowpass Filtering // Creates lowpass filters which are commonly
		used in ion channel recordings. It supports generation of
		random numbers that are filtered, i.e. follow a model for ion
		channel recordings, see doi:10.1109/TNB.2018.2845126.
		Furthermore, time continuous convolutions of piecewise constant
		signals with the kernel of lowpass filters can be computed.
