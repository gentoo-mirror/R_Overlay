		Exponentially Weighted Moving Average with Adjustments to
		Measurement Error // The univariate statistical quality control
		tool aims to address measurement error effects when
		constructing exponentially weighted moving average p control
		charts. The method primarily focuses on binary random
		variables, but it can be applied to any continuous random
		variables by using sign statistic to transform them to discrete
		ones. With the correction of measurement error effects, we can
		obtain the corrected control limits of exponentially weighted
		moving average p control chart and reasonably adjusted
		exponentially weighted moving average p control charts. The
		methods in this package can be found in some relevant
		references, such as Chen and Yang (2022) arXiv: 2203.03384;
		Yang et al. (2011) doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2010.11.044; Yang and
		Arnold (2014) doi: 10.1155/2014/238719; Yang (2016) doi:
		10.1080/03610918.2013.763980 and Yang and Arnold (2016) doi:
