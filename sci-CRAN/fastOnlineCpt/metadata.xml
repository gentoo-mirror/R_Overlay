		Online Multivariate Changepoint Detection // Implementation of a
		simple algorithm designed for online multivariate changepoint
		detection of a mean in sparse changepoint settings. The
		algorithm is based on a modified cusum statistic and guarantees
		control of the type I error on any false discoveries, while
		featuring O(1) time and O(1) memory updates per series as well
		as a proven detection delay.
