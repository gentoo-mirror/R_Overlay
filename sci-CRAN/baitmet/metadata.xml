		Library Driven Compound Profiling in GC-MS Data // Automated
		quantification of metabolites by targeting mass
		spectral/retention time libraries into full scan-acquired gas
		chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) chromatograms.
		Baitmet outputs a table with compounds name, spectral matching
		score, retention index error, and compounds area in each
		sample. Baitmet can automatically determine the compounds
		retention indexes with or without co-injection of internal
		standards with samples.
