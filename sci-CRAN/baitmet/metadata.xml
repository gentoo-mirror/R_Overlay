		Library Driven Compound Profiling in Gas Chromatography - Mass
		Spectrometry Data // Automated quantification of metabolites by
		targeting mass spectral/retention time libraries into full
		scan-acquired gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
		chromatograms. Baitmet outputs a table with compounds name,
		spectral matching score, retention index error, and compounds
		area in each sample. Baitmet can automatically determine the
		compounds retention indexes with or without co-injection of
		internal standards with samples.
