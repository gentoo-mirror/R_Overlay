		Flexible Tree Taper Curves Based on Semiparametric Mixed Models
		// Implementation of functions for fitting taper curves (a
		semiparametric linear mixed effects taper model) to diameter
		measurements along stems. Further functions are provided to
		estimate the uncertainty around the predicted curves, to
		calculate timber volume (also by sections) and marginal (e.g.,
		upper) diameters. For cases where tree heights are not
		measured, methods for estimating additional variance in volume
		predictions resulting from uncertainties in tree height models
		(tariffs) are provided.  The example data include the taper
		curve parameters for Norway spruce used in the 3rd German NFI
		fitted to 380 trees and a subset of section-wise diameter
		measurements of these trees. The functions implemented here are
		detailed in the following publication: Kublin, E., Breidenbach,
		J., Kaendler, G. (2013) A flexible stem taper and volume
		prediction method based on mixed-effects B-spline regression,
		Eur J For Res, 132:983-997.
