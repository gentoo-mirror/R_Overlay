		Ensemble Based Machine Learning Approach for Predicting
		Methylation States // DNA methylation (6mA) is a major
		epigenetic process by which alteration in gene expression took
		place without changing the DNA sequence. Predicting these sites
		in-vitro is laborious, time consuming as well as costly. This
		'EpiSemble' package is an in-silico pipeline for predicting DNA
		sequences containing the 6mA sites. It uses an ensemble-based
		machine learning approach by combining Support Vector Machine
		(SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting approach to
		predict the sequences with 6mA sites in it. This package has
		been developed by using the concept of Chen et al. (2019)
