		Visualising Output from Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers and
		Ensemble-Based Methods // Functions for plotting, and
		animating, the output of importance samplers, sequential Monte
		Carlo samplers (SMC) and ensemble-based methods. The package
		can be used to plot and animate histograms, densities, scatter
		plots and time series, and to plot the genealogy of an SMC or
		ensemble-based algorithm. These functions all rely on algorithm
		output to be supplied in tidy format. A function is provided to
		transform algorithm output from matrix format (one Monte Carlo
		point per row) to the tidy format required by the plotting and
		animating functions.
