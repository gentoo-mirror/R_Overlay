		Deferred List - A Read-Only List-Like Object with Deferred Access
		// Implements the 'deflist' class, a read-only list-like object
		that accesses its elements via a function. The 'deflist' class
		can be used to model deferred access to data or computations by
		routing indexed list access to a function. This approach is
		particularly useful when sequential list-like access to data is
		required but holding all the data in memory at once is not
		feasible. The package also provides utilities for memoisation
		and caching to optimize access to frequently requested
		elements.
