		Extensible Package for Parallel, Batch Training of Base Learners
		for Ensemble Modeling // Extensible S4 classes and methods for
		batch training of regression and classification algorithms such
		as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, Neural Network,
		Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Penalized
		Regression (L1/L2), and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees.
		These algorithms constitute a set of 'base learners', which can
		subsequently be combined together to form ensemble predictions.
		This package provides cross-validation wrappers to allow for
		downstream application of ensemble integration techniques,
		including best-error selection. All base learner estimation
		objects are retained, allowing for repeated prediction calls
		without the need for re-training. For large problems, an option
		is provided to save estimation objects to disk, along with
		prediction methods that utilize these objects. This allows
		users to train and predict with large ensembles of base
		learners without being constrained by system RAM.
