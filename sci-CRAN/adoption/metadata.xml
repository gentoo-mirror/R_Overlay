		Modelling Adoption Process in Marketing // The classical Bass
		(1969) doi:10.1287/mnsc.15.5.215 model and the agent based
		models, such as that by Goldenberg, Libai and Muller (2010)
		doi:10.1016/j.ijresmar.2009.06.006 have been two different
		approaches to model adoption processes in marketing. These two
		approaches can be unified by explicitly modelling the utility
		functions. This package provides a GUI that allows, in a
		unified way, the modelling of these two processes and other
		processes.
