		Send Messages, Images, R Objects and Files to 'Slack'
		Channels/Users // 'Slack' https://slack.com/ provides a service
		for teams to collaborate by sharing messages, images, links,
		files and more. Functions are provided that make it possible to
		interact with the 'Slack' platform 'API'. When you need to
		share information or data from R, rather than resort to copy/
		paste in e-mails or other services like 'Skype'
		https://www.skype.com/en/, you can use this package to send
		well-formatted output from multiple R objects and expressions
		to all teammates at the same time with little effort. You can
		also send images from the current graphics device, R objects,
		and upload files.
