		Distributed Online Covariance Matrix Tests // Distributed Online
		Covariance Matrix Tests is a powerful tool designed to
		efficiently process and analyze distributed datasets. It
		enables users to perform covariance matrix tests in an online,
		distributed manner, making it highly suitable for large-scale
		data analysis. By leveraging advanced computational techniques,
		'Docovt' ensures robust and scalable solutions for statistical
		analysis, particularly in scenarios where data is dispersed
		across multiple nodes or sources. This package is ideal for
		researchers and practitioners working with high-dimensional
		data, providing a flexible and efficient framework for
		covariance matrix estimation and hypothesis testing. The
		philosophy of 'Docovt' is described in Guo G.(2025)
