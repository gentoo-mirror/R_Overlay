		Non-Supervised Regional Frequency Analysis // A collection of
		statistical tools for objective (non-supervised) applications
		of the Regional Frequency Analysis methods in hydrology. The
		package refers to the index-value method and, more precisely,
		helps the hydrologist to: (1) regionalize the index-value; (2)
		form homogeneous regions with similar growth curves; (3) fit
		distribution functions to the empirical regional growth curves.
