		Core Functionality for Environmental Time Series // Utility
		functions for working with environmental time series data from
		known locations. The compact data model is structured as a list
		with two dataframes. A 'meta' dataframe contains spatial and
		measuring device metadata associated with deployments at known
		locations. A 'data' dataframe contains a 'datetime' column
		followed by columns of measurements associated with each
		"device-deployment". Ephemerides calculations are based on code
		originally found in NOAA's "Solar Calculator"
		https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/.
