		Spatial Variable Selection // Perform variable selection for the
		spatial Poisson regression model under the adaptive elastic net
		penalty. Spatial count data with covariates is the input. We
		use a spatial Poisson regression model to link the spatial
		counts and covariates. For maximization of the likelihood under
		adaptive elastic net penalty, we implemented the penalized
		quasi-likelihood (PQL) and the approximate penalized
		loglikelihood (APL) methods. The proposed methods can
		automatically select important covariates, while adjusting for
		possible spatial correlations among the responses. More details
		are available in Xie et al. (2018, arXiv:1809.06418). The
		package also contains the Lyme disease dataset, which consists
		of the disease case data from 2006 to 2011, and demographic
		data and land cover data in Virginia. The Lyme disease case
		data were collected by the Virginia Department of Health. The
		demographic data (e.g., population density, median income, and
		average age) are from the 2010 census. Land cover data were
		obtained from the Multi-Resolution Land Cover Consortium for
		2006.
