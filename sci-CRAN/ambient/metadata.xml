		A Generator of Multidimensional Noise // Generation of natural
		looking noise has many application within simulation,
		procedural generation, and art, to name a few. The 'ambient'
		package provides an interface to the 'FastNoise' C++ library
		and allows for efficient generation of perlin, simplex, worley,
		cubic, value, and white noise with optional pertubation in
		either 2, 3, or 4 (in case of simplex and white noise)
		dimensions.
