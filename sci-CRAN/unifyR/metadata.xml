		Unified Scores, Reliabilities and Validities from Multiple Tests
		// In diagnostic contexts, individuals are often assessed using
		multiple tests that measure the same latent variable (e.g.,
		intelligence). These test scores are typically not exactly
		identical. Simple averaging neglects the correlation between
		tests and the reduced variance of their combination. The
		'unifyR' package provides functions to compute statistically
		accurate unified scores, reliabilities and validities of
		multiple tests. The underlying algorithms build on and extend
		the method proposed by Evans (1996, DOI:10.3758/BF03204767) and
		have been validated through simulations.
