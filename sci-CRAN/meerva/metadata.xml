		Analysis of Data with Measurement Error Using a Validation
		Subsample // Analyze data with measurement error when there is
		a validation subsample randomly selected from the full sample.
		The method assumes surrogate variables measured with error are
		available for the full sample, and reference variables measured
		with little or no error are available for this randomly chosen
		subsample of the full sample.  Measurement errors may be
		differential or non differential, in any or all predictors
		(simultaneously) as well as outcome.  The "augmented" estimates
		derived are based upon the multivariate correlation between
		regression model parameter estimates for the reference
		variables and for the surrogate variables in the validation
		subset.  Because the validation subsample is chosen at random
		whatever biases are imposed by measurement error, non-
		differential or differential, are reflected in this correlation
		and can be used to derive estimates for the reference variables
		using data from the whole sample.  This work derives from Chen
