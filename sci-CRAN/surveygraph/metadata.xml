		Network Representations of Attitudes // A tool for computing
		network representations of attitudes, extracted from tabular
		data such as sociological surveys. By treating a survey as a
		bipartite network, we measure the similarity between
		respondents and survey items to produce network edges. We do
		this in both a respondent network, as well as a survey item
		network. Used in combination with graph visualisation
		libraries, this techniques helps practitioners in the social
		sciences identify network structure that may be present within
		a survey at a glance.
