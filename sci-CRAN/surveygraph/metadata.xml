		Network Representations of Attitudes // A tool for computing
		network representations of attitudes, extracted from tabular
		data such as sociological surveys. Development of surveygraph
		software and training materials was initially funded by the
		European Union under the ERC Proof-of-concept programme (ERC,
		Attitude-Maps-4-All, project number: 101069264). Views and
		opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and
		do not necessarily reflect those of the European Union or the
		European Research Council Executive Agency. Neither the
		European Union nor the granting authority can be held
		responsible for them.
