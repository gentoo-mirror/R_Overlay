		Power Logit Regression for Modeling Bounded Data // Fitting power
		logit regression models for bounded continuous data, in which
		the density generator may be normal, Student-t, power
		exponential, slash, hyperbolic, sinh-normal, or type II
		logistic. Diagnostic tools associated with the fitted model,
		such as the residuals, local influence measures, leverage
		measures, and goodness-of-fit statistics, are implemented. The
		estimation process follows the maximum likelihood approach and,
		currently, the package supports two types of estimators: the
		usual maximum likelihood estimator and the penalized maximum
		likelihood estimator. More details about power logit regression
		models are described in Queiroz and Ferrari (2022)
		arXiv:2202.01697.
