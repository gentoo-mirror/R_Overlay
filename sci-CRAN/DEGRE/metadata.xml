		Inferring Differentially Expressed Genes using Generalized Linear
		Mixed Models // Genes that are differentially expressed between
		two or more experimental conditions can be detected in RNA-Seq.
		A high biological variability may impact the discovery of these
		genes once it may be divergent between the fixed effects.
		However, this variability can be covered by the random effects.
		'DEGRE' was designed to identify the differentially expressed
		genes considering fixed and random effects on individuals.
		These effects are identified earlier in the experimental design
		matrix. 'DEGRE' has the implementation of preprocessing
		procedures to clean the near zero gene reads in the count
		matrix, normalize by 'RLE' published in the 'DESeq2' package,
		'Love et al. (2014)' doi:10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8 and it fits
		a regression for each gene using the Generalized Linear Mixed
		Model with the negative binomial distribution, followed by a
		Wald test to assess the regression coefficients.
