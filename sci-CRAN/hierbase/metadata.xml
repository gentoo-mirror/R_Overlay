		Enabling Hierarchical Multiple Testing // Implementation of
		hierarchical inference based on Renaux and Bhlmann (2021)
		'Efficient Multiple Testing Adjustment for Hierarchical
		Inference' arXiv:2104.15028. The R-package 'hierbase' offers
		tools to perform hierarchical inference for one or multiple
		data sets based on ready-to-use (group) test functions or
		alternatively a user specified (group) test function. The
		procedure is based on an efficient hierarchical multiple
		testing correction and controls the family-wise error rate
		(FWER). The functions can easily be run in parallel.
		Hierarchical inference can be applied to (low- or) high-
		dimensional data sets to find significant groups or single
		variables (depending on the signal strength and correlation
		structure) in a data-driven and automated procedure. Possible
		applications can for example be found in statistical genetics
		and statistical genomics.
