		Enabling Hierarchical Multiple Testing // Implementation of
		hierarchical inference based on Meinshausen (2008).
		Hierarchical testing of variable importance. Biometrika, 95(2),
		265-278 and Renaux, Buzdugan, Kalisch, and Bhlmann, (2020).
		Hierarchical inference for genome-wide association studies: a
		view on methodology with software. Computational Statistics,
		35(1), 1-40. The R-package 'hierbase' offers tools to perform
		hierarchical inference for one or multiple data sets based on
		ready-to-use (group) test functions or alternatively a user
		specified (group) test function. The procedure is based on a
		hierarchical multiple testing correction and controls the
		family-wise error rate (FWER). The functions can easily be run
		in parallel. Hierarchical inference can be applied to (low- or)
		high-dimensional data sets to find significant groups or single
		variables (depending on the signal strength and correlation
		structure) in a data-driven and automated procedure. Possible
		applications can for example be found in statistical genetics
		and statistical genomics.
