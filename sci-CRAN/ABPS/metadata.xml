		The Abnormal Blood Profile Score to Detect Blood Doping // An
		implementation of the Abnormal Blood Profile Score (ABPS, part
		of the Athlete Biological Passport program of the World Anti-
		Doping Agency), which combines several blood parameters into a
		single score in order to detect blood doping (Sottas et al.
		(2006) doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1011). The package also contains
		functions to calculate other scores used in anti-doping
		programs, such as the OFF-score (Gore et al. (2003)
		http://www.haematologica.org/content/88/3/333), as well as
		example data.
