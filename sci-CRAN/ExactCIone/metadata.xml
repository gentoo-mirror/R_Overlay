		Admissible Exact Intervals for One-Dimensional Discrete
		Distributions // Construct the admissible exact intervals for
		the binomial proportion, the Poisson mean and the total number
		of subjects with a certain attribute or the total number of the
		subjects for the hypergeometric distribution. Both one-sided
		and two-sided intervals are of interest. This package can be
		used to calculate the intervals constructed methods developed
		by Wang (2014) doi:10.5705/ss.2012.257 and Wang (2015)
