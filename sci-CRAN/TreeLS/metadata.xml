		Terrestrial Point Cloud Processing of Forest Data // Algorithms
		for tree detection, noise removal, stem modelling, 3D
		visualization and manipulation of terrestrial 'LiDAR' (but not
		only) point clouds, currently focusing on high performance
		applications for forest inventory - being fully compatible with
		the 'LAS' infrastructure provided by 'lidR'. For in depth
		descriptions of the stem classification and segmentation
		algorithms check out Conto et al. (2017)
