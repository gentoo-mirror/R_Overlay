		Tools for Generating, Visualizing, and Analysing Link Communities
		in Networks // Link communities reveal the nested and
		overlapping structure in networks, and uncover the key nodes
		that form connections to multiple communities. linkcomm
		provides a set of tools for generating, visualizing, and
		analysing link communities in networks of arbitrary size and
		type. The linkcomm package also includes tools for generating,
		visualizing, and analysing Overlapping Cluster Generator (OCG)
		communities. Kalinka and Tomancak (2011)
