		Colorblind-Friendly Color Maps for R // Color maps designed to
		improve graph readability for readers with common forms of
		color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps
		are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also
		when converted to black-and-white for printing. This package
		also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous
		color and fill scales. A lean version of the package called
		'viridisLite' that does not include the 'ggplot2' bindings can
		be found at https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridisLite.
