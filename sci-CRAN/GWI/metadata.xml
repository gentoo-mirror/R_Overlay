		Count and Continuous Generalized Variability Indexes //
		Univariate Poisson dispersion index for count data, univariate
		exponential variation index for positive continuous data
		functions are performed. Also, the generalized dispersion index
		and the marginal dispersion index functions are carried out.
		Finally, the generalized variation index and the marginal
		variation index functions are computed.
