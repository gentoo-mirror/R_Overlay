		Count and Continuous Generalized Variability Indexes // Firstly,
		both functions of the univariate Poisson dispersion index (DI)
		for count data and the univariate exponential variation index
		(VI) for nonnegative continuous data are performed. Next, other
		functions of univariate indexes such the binomial dispersion
		index (DIb), the negative binomial dispersion index (DInb) and
		the inverse Gaussian variation index (VIiG) are given. Finally,
		we are computed some multivariate versions of these functions
		such that the generalized dispersion index (GDI) with its
		marginal one (MDI) and the generalized variation index (GVI)
		with its marginal one (MVI) too.
