		Count and Continuous Generalized Variability Indexes //
		Univariate Poisson dispersion index (DI) for count data,
		univariate exponential variation index (VI) for positive
		continuous data functions are performed. Also, the generalized
		dispersion index (GDI) and the marginal dispersion index (MDI)
		functions are carried out. Finally, the generalized variation
		index (GVI) and the marginal variation index (MVI) functions
		are computed. See Abid et al. (2020), Fisher (1934), Kokonendji
		and Puig (2018), Kokonendji et al. (2020) and Tour et al.
		(2020) for more details on these indexes.
