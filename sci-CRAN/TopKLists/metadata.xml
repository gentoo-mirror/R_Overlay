		Inference, Aggregation and Visualization for Top-K Ranked Lists
		// For multiple ranked input lists (full or partial)
		representing the same set of N objects, the package 'TopKLists'
		doi:10.1515/sagmb-2014-0093 offers (1) statistical inference on
		the lengths of informative top-k lists, (2) stochastic
		aggregation of full or partial lists, and (3) graphical tools
		for the statistical exploration of input lists, and for the
		visualization of aggregation results. Note that RGtk2 and
		gWidgets2RGtk2 have been archived on CRAN. See
		https://github.com/pievos101/TopKLists for installation
		instructions.
