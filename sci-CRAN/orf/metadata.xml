		Ordered Random Forests // An implementation of the Ordered Forest
		estimator as developed in Lechner  Okasa (2019)
		arXiv:1907.02436. The Ordered Forest flexibly estimates the
		conditional probabilities of models with ordered categorical
		outcomes (so-called ordered choice models). Additionally to
		common machine learning algorithms the 'orf' package provides
		functions for estimating marginal effects as well as
		statistical inference thereof and thus provides similar output
		as in standard econometric models for ordered choice. The core
		forest algorithm relies on the fast C++ forest implementation
		from the 'ranger' package (Wright  Ziegler, 2017)
		arXiv:1508.04409.
