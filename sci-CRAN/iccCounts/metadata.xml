		Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for Count Data // Estimates
		the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for count data to
		assess repeatability (intra-methods concordance) and
		concordance (between-method concordance). In the concordance
		setting, the ICC is equivalent to the concordance correlation
		coefficient estimated by variance components. The ICC is
		estimated using the estimates from generalized linear mixed
		models. The within-subjects distributions considered are:
		Poisson; Negative Binomial with additive and proportional
		extradispersion; Zero-Inflated Poisson; and Zero-Inflated
		Negative Binomial with additive and proportional
		extradispersion. The statistical methodology used to estimate
		the ICC with count data can be found in Carrasco (2010)
