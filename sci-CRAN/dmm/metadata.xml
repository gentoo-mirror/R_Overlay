		Dyadic Mixed Model for Pedigree Data // Mixed model analysis for
		quantitative genetics with multi-trait responses and pedigree-
		based partitioning of individual variation into a range of
		environmental and genetic variance components for individual
		and maternal effects. Method documented in dmmOverview.pdf; dmm
		is an implementation of dispersion mean model described by
		Searle et al. (1992) "Variance Components", Wiley, NY. Dmm()
		can do 'MINQUE', 'bias-corrected-ML', and 'REML'  variance and
