		Analysis and Exploration of Mixed Microbial Genomic Samples //
		Tool for exploring DNA and amino acid variation and inferring
		the presence of target lineages from microbial high-throughput
		genomic DNA samples that potentially contain mixtures of
		variants/lineages. MixviR was originally created to help
		analyze environmental SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 samples from
		environmental sources such as wastewater or dust, but can be
		applied to any microbial group. Inputs include reference genome
		information in commonly-used file formats (fasta, bed) and one
		or more variant call format (VCF) files, which can be generated
		with programs such as Illumina's DRAGEN, the Genome Analysis
		Toolkit, or bcftools. See DePristo et al (2011)
		doi:10.1038/ng.806 and Danecek et al (2021)
		doi:10.1093/gigascience/giab008 for these tools, respectively.
		Available outputs include a table of mutations observed in the
		sample(s), estimates of proportions of target lineages in the
		sample(s), and an R Shiny dashboard to interactively explore
		the data.
