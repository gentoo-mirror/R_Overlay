		Definition of Geographic Dimensions // The geographic dimension
		plays a fundamental role in multidimensional systems. To define
		a geographic dimension in a star schema, we need a table with
		attributes corresponding to the levels of the dimension.
		Additionally, we will also need one or more geographic layers
		to represent the data using this dimension. The goal of this
		package is to support the definition of geographic dimensions
		from layers of geographic information related to each other. It
		makes it easy to define relationships between layers and obtain
		the necessary data from them.
