		Statistical Comparison of Two Networks Based on Several
		Invariance Measures // This permutation based hypothesis test,
		suited for several types of data supported by the
		estimateNetwork function of the bootnet package (Epskamp
		Fried, 2018), assesses the difference between two networks
		based on several invariance measures (network structure
		invariance, global strength invariance, edge invariance,
		several centrality measures, etc.). Network structures are
		estimated with l1-regularization. The Network Comparison Test
		is suited for comparison of independent (e.g., two different
		groups) and dependent samples (e.g., one group that is measured
		twice). See van Borkulo et al. (2021), available from
		doi:10.1037/met0000476.
