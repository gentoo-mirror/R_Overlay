		Assemble 'SSN' Objects // Import, create and assemble data needed
		to fit spatial-statistical stream-network models using the
		'SSN2' package for 'R'. Streams, observations, and prediction
		locations are represented as simple features and specific tools
		provided to define topological relationships between features;
		calculate the hydrologic distances (with flow-direction
		preserved) and the spatial additive function used to weight
		converging stream segments; and export the topological,
		spatial, and attribute information to an `SSN` (spatial stream
		network) object, which can be efficiently stored, accessed and
		analysed in 'R'. A detailed description of methods used to
		calculate and format the spatial data can be found in Peterson,
		E.E. and Ver Hoef, J.M., (2014) doi:10.18637/jss.v056.i02.
