		Genome-Wide Association Study with SLOPE // Genome-wide
		association study (GWAS) performed with SLOPE, short for Sorted
		L-One Penalized Estimation, a method for estimating the vector
		of coefficients in linear model. In the first step of GWAS,
		SNPs are clumped according to their correlations and distances.
		Then, SLOPE is performed on data where each clump has one
		representative.
