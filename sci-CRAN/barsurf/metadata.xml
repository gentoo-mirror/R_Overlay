		Heatmap-Related Plots and Smooth Multiband Color Interpolation //
		Supports combined contour-heat plots and 3D bar/surface plots,
		for plotting scalar fields, either discretely-spaced or
		continuously-spaced. Also, supports matrix visualization (per
		se), isosurfaces (for scalar fields over three variables),
		triangular plots and vector fields. All plots use static vector
		graphics (suitable for Sweave documents), but high resolution
		heatmaps can produce smooth raster-like visual effects.
		Contains a flexible system for smooth multiband color
		interpolation in RGB, HSV and HCL color spaces.
