		Contour Plots, 3D Plots, Vector Fields and Heatmaps // Combined
		contour/heatmap plots, 3d bar/surface plots, 2d/3d triangular
		plots, isosurface plots and 2d/3d vector fields. By default,
		uses vector graphics, but it's possible to use raster graphics
		for regular heatmaps. Builds on the colorspace package
		(Zeileis, et al., 2020 doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i01), by
		supporting smooth multiband color interpolation, in sRGB, HSV
