		Minimal Bar Plots and Surface Plots in 3D // Implements plots of
		discrete functions (bar plots) and continuous functions
		(surface plots) in 3D. Uses orthographic projection, a
		nonstandard fixed viewing angle, does not support detailed axes
		and is designed to be relatively minimal and simple, from a
		programming perspective. However, does support mixed bar sizes
		and multiple colors.
