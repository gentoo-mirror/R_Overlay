		Alternating Optimization // Alternating optimization is an
		iterative procedure that optimizes a function by alternately
		performing restricted optimization over individual parameter
		subsets. Instead of tackling joint optimization directly, it
		breaks the problem down into simpler sub-problems. This
		approach can make optimization feasible when joint optimization
		is too difficult.
