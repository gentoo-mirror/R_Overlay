		Alternating Optimization // An iterative process that optimizes a
		function by alternately performing restricted optimization over
		parameter subsets. Instead of joint optimization, it breaks the
		optimization problem down into simpler sub-problems. This
		approach can make optimization feasible when joint optimization
		is too difficult.
