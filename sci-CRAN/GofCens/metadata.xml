		Goodness-of-Fit Methods for Complete and Right-Censored Data //
		Graphical tools and goodness-of-fit tests for complete and
		right-censored data: 1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramr-von Mises,
		and Anderson-Darling tests, which utilize the empirical
		distribution function for complete data and are extended to
		handle right-censored data. 2. Generalized chi-squared-type
		test, which is based on the squared differences between
		observed and expected counts using random cells with right-
		censored data. 3. Graphical tools, such as probability and
		cumulative hazard plots, to help guide decisions about the most
		appropriate parametric model for the data.
