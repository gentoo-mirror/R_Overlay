		Goodness-of-Fit Methods for Right-Censored Data // Graphical
		tools and goodness-of-fit tests for right-censored data: 1.
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Crmer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests
		based on the empirical distribution function for complete data
		and their extensions  for  right-censored data. 2. Generalized
		chi-squared-type tests  based on the squared difference between
		observed and expected counts using random cells with right-
		censored data. 3. A series of graphical tools such as
		probability or cumulative hazard plots to guide the decision
		about the parametric model that best fits the data.
