		Goodness-of-Fit Methods for Complete and Right-Censored Data //
		Graphical tools and goodness-of-fit tests for complete and
		right-censored data: 1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramr-von Mises,
		and Anderson-Darling tests, which use the empirical
		distribution function for complete data and are extended for
		right-censored data. 2. Generalized chi-squared-type test,
		which is based on the squared differences between observed and
		expected counts using random cells with right-censored data. 3.
		A series of graphical tools such as probability or cumulative
		hazard plots to guide the decision about the most suitable
		parametric model for the data.
