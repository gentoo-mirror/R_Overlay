		Schumaker Shape-Preserving Spline // This is a shape preserving
		spline which is guaranteed to be monotonic and concave or
		convex if the data is monotonic and concave or convex. It does
		not use any optimisation and is therefore quick and smoothly
		converges to a fixed point in economic dynamics problems
		including value function iteration. It also automatically gives
		the first two derivatives of the spline and options for
		determining behaviour when evaluated outside the interpolation
		domain.
