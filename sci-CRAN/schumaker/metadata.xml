		Schumaker Shape-Preserving Spline // This is a shape preserving
		spline doi:10.1137/0720057 which is guaranteed to be monotonic
		and concave or convex if the data is monotonic and concave or
		convex. It does not use any optimisation and is therefore quick
		and smoothly converges to a fixed point in economic dynamics
		problems including value function iteration. It also
		automatically gives the first two derivatives of the spline and
		options for determining behaviour when evaluated outside the
		interpolation domain.
