		Dynamic Mixed-Membership Network Regression Model // Stochastic
		collapsed variational inference on mixed-membership stochastic
		blockmodel for networks, incorporating node-level predictors of
		mixed-membership vectors, as well as dyad-level predictors. For
		networks observed over time, the model defines a hidden Markov
		process that allows the effects of node-level predictors to
		evolve in discrete, historical periods. In addition, the
		package offers a variety of utilities for exploring results of
		estimation, including tools for conducting posterior predictive
		checks of goodness-of-fit and several plotting functions. The
		package implements methods described in Olivella, Pratt and
		Imai (2019) 'Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodel Regression for
		Social Networks: Application to International Conflicts',
		available at https://www.santiagoolivella.info/pdfs/socnet.pdf.
