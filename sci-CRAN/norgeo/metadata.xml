		Tracking Geo Code Change of Regional Granularity in Norway //
		Regional granularity levels in Norway which are depicted by
		different codes, have undergone several changes over the years.
		Identifying when codes have changed and how many changes have
		taken place can be troublesome. This package will help to
		identify these changes and when the changes have taken place.
		One of the limitation of this package is that it is heavily
		depending on the codes available from SSB website
		https://data.ssb.no/api/klass/v1/api-guide.html.
