		Score Redistricting Plans with 'PlanScore' // Provides access to
		the 'PlanScore' Application Programming Interface
		(https://github.com/PlanScore/PlanScore/blob/main/API.md) for
		scoring redistricting plans. Allows for upload of plans from
		block assignment files and shape files. For shapes in memory,
		such as from 'sf' or 'redist', it processes them to save and
		upload. Includes tools for tidying responses and saving output
		from the website.
