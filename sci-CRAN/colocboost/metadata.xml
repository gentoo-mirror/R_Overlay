		Multi-Context Colocalization Analysis for QTL and GWAS Studies //
		A multi-task learning approach to variable selection regression
		with highly correlated predictors and sparse effects, based on
		frequentist statistical inference. It provides statistical
		evidence to identify which subsets of predictors have non-zero
		effects on which subsets of response variables, motivated and
		designed for colocalization analysis across genome-wide
		association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL)
		studies. The ColocBoost model is described in Cao et. al.
