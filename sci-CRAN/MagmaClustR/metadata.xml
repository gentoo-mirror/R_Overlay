		Clustering and Prediction using Multi-Task Gaussian Processes
		with Common Mean // An implementation for the multi-task
		Gaussian processes with common mean framework. Two main
		algorithms, called 'Magma' and 'MagmaClust', are available to
		perform predictions for supervised learning problems, in
		particular for time series or any functional/continuous data
		applications. The corresponding articles has been respectively
		proposed by Arthur Leroy, Pierre Latouche, Benjamin Guedj and
		Servane Gey (2022) doi:10.1007/s10994-022-06172-1, and Arthur
		Leroy, Pierre Latouche, Benjamin Guedj and Servane Gey (2020)
		arXiv:2011.07866. Theses approaches leverage the learning of
		cluster-specific mean processes, which are common across
		similar tasks, to provide enhanced prediction performances
		(even far from data) at a linear computational cost (in the
		number of tasks).  'MagmaClust' is a generalisation of 'Magma'
		where the tasks are simultaneously clustered into groups, each
		being associated to a specific mean process.  User-oriented
		functions in the package are decomposed into training,
		prediction and plotting functions. Some basic features (classic
		kernels, training, prediction) of standard Gaussian processes
		are also implemented.
