		Pairwise Association of Functional Annotations // Finds pairs of
		functional annotations or gene ontology (GO) terms that are
		enriched within a directed network (such as a gene regulatory
		network).  This works with or without edge weights and includes
		visualizations (both as a network where the functions are nodes
		and as a heatmap).  PAFway is an acronym for Pairwise
		Associations of Functional annotations in biological networks
		and pathWAYs.
