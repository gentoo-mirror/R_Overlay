		Frequent Pattern Mining Outliers // Algorithms for detection of
		outliers based on frequent pattern mining. Such algorithms
		follow the paradigm: if an instance contains more frequent
		patterns, it means that this data instance is unlikely to be an
		anomaly (He Zengyou, Xu Xiaofei, Huang Zhexue Joshua, Deng
		Shengchun (2005) doi:10.2298/CSIS0501103H). The package
		implements a list of existing state of the art algorithms as
		well as other published approaches: FPI, WFPI, FPOF, FPCOF,
		LFPOF, MFPOF, WCFPOF and WFPOF.
