		Piecewise Geodesic Smoothing for Spherical Data // Fitting a
		smooth path to a given set of noisy spherical data observed at
		known time points. It implements a piecewise geodesic curve
		fitting method on the unit sphere based on a velocity-based
		penalization scheme. The proposed approach is implemented using
		the Riemannian block coordinate descent algorithm. To
		understand the method and algorithm, one can refer to Bak, K.
		Y., Shin, J. K.,  Koo, J. Y. (2023)
		doi:10.1080/02664763.2022.2054962 for the case of order 1.
		Additionally, this package includes various functions necessary
		for handling spherical data.
