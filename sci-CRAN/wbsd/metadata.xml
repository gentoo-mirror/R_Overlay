		Wild Bootstrap Size Diagnostics // Implements the diagnostic
		"theta" developed in Poetscher and Preinerstorfer (2020) "How
		Reliable are Bootstrap-based Heteroskedasticity Robust Tests?"
		arXiv:2005.04089. This diagnostic can be used to detect and
		weed out bootstrap-based procedures that provably have size
		equal to one for a given testing problem. The implementation
		covers a large variety of bootstrap-based procedures, cf. the
		above mentioned article for details. A function for computing
		bootstrap p-values is provided.
