		Process and Visualise Concept Mapping Data // Concept maps are
		versatile tools used across disciplines to enhance
		understanding, teaching, brainstorming, and information
		organization. This package provides functions for processing
		and visualizing concept mapping data, involving the sequential
		use of cluster analysis (for sorting participants and
		statements), multidimensional scaling (for positioning
		statements in a conceptual space), and visualization
		techniques, including point cluster maps and dendrograms. The
		methodology and its validity are discussed in Kampen, J.K.,
		Hageman, J.A., Breuer, M.,  Tobi, H. (2025). "The validity of
		concept mapping: let's call a spade a spade." Qual Quant.
