		Process and Visualise Concept Mapping Data // Processing and
		visualizing concept mapping data. Concept maps are versatile
		tools used across disciplines to enhance understanding,
		teaching, brainstorming, and information organization. The
		analysis of concept mapping data involves the sequential use of
		cluster analysis (for sorting participants and statements),
		multidimensional scaling (for positioning statements in a
		conceptual space), and visualization techniques, including
		point cluster maps and dendrograms.
