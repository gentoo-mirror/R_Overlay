		Ranking of Nodes with Kernelized Score Functions //
		Implementation of Kernelized score functions and other semi-
		supervised learning algorithms for node label ranking in
		biomolecular networks. RANKS can be easily applied to a large
		set of different relevant problems in computational biology,
		ranging from automatic protein function prediction, to gene
		disease prioritization and drug repositioning, and more in
		general to any bioinformatics problem that can be formalized as
		a node label ranking problem in a graph. The modular nature of
		the implementation allows to experiment with different score
		functions and kernels and to easily compare the results with
		baseline network-based methods such as label propagation and
		random walk algorithms, as well as to enlarge the algorithmic
		scheme by adding novel user-defined score functions and
		kernels.
