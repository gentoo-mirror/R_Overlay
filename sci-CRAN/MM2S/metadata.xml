		Single-Sample Classifier of Medulloblastoma Subtypes for
		Medulloblastoma Patient Samples, Mouse Models, and Cell Lines
		// A single-sample classifier that generates Medulloblastoma
		(MB) subtype predictions for single-samples of human
		Medulloblastoma (MB) patients and model systems, including cell
		lines and mouse-models. The MM2S algorithm uses a systems-based
		methodology that facilitates application of the algorithm on
		samples irrespective of their platform or source of origin.
		MM2S demonstrates  96% accuracy for patients of well-
		characterized normal cerebellum, Wingless (WNT), or Sonic
		hedgehog (SHH) subtypes, and the less-characterized Group4
		(86%) and Group3 (78.2%). MM2S also enables classification of
		MB cell lines and mouse models into their human
		counterparts.This package contains function for implementing
		the classifier onto human data and mouse data, as well as
		graphical rendering of the results as PCA (Principal Component
		Analysis) plots and heatmaps. Deena Gendoo and Benjamin Haibe-
		Kains (2016) doi:10.1186/s13029-016-0053-y.
