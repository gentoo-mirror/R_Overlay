		One Rule Machine Learning Classification Algorithm with
		Enhancements // Implements the One Rule (OneR) Machine Learning
		classification algorithm (Holte, R.C. (1993)
		doi:10.1023/A:1022631118932) with enhancements for
		sophisticated handling of numeric data and missing values
		together with extensive diagnostic functions. It is useful as a
		baseline for machine learning models and the rules are often
		helpful heuristics.
