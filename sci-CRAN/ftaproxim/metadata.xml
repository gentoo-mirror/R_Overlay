		Fault Tree Analysis Based on Proxel Simulation // Calculation and
		plotting of instantaneous unavailabilities of basic events
		along with the top event of fault trees are issues important in
		reliability analysis of complex systems. Here, a fault tree is
		provided in terms of its minimal cut sets, along with
		reliability and maintainability distribution functions of the
		basic events. All the methods are derived from Horton (2002,
		ISBN: 3-936150-21-4), Niloofar and Lazarova-Molnar (2022).
