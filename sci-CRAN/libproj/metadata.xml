		Generic Coordinate Transformation Library ('PROJ') C API //
		Provides a 'PROJ' https://proj.org C API that can be used to
		write high-performance C and C++ coordinate transformation
		operations using R as an interface. This package contains an
		internal version of the 'PROJ' library to guarantee the best
		possible consistency on multiple platforms, and to provide a
		means by which 'PROJ' can be used on platforms where it may be
		impractical or impossible to install a binary version of the
		library.
