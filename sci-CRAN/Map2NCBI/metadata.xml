		Mapping Markers to the Nearest Genomic Feature // Allows the user
		to generate a list of features (gene, pseudo, RNA, CDS, and/or
		UTR) directly from NCBI database for any species with a current
		build available. Option to save downloaded and formatted files
		is available, and the user can prioritize the feature list
		based on type and assembly builds present in the current build
		used. The user can then use the list of features generated or
		provide a list to map a set of markers (designed for SNP
		markers with a single base pair position available) to the
		closest feature based on the map build. This function does
		require map positions of the markers to be provided and the
		positions should be based on the build being queried through
		NCBI.
