		Predict and Visualize Population-Level Changes in Allele
		Frequencies in Response to Climate Change // Methods (Kindt, R.
		2021. doi:10.1101/2021.01.15.426775) are provided of
		calibrating and predicting shifts in allele frequencies through
		redundancy analysis ('vegan::rda()') and generalized additive
		models ('mgcv::gam()'). Visualization functions for predicted
		changes in allele frequencies include 'shift.dot.ggplot()',
		'shift.pie.ggplot()', 'shift.moon.ggplot()',
		'shift.waffle.ggplot()' and 'shift.surf.ggplot()' that are made
		with input data sets that are prepared by helper functions for
		each visualization method. Examples in the documentation show
		how to prepare animated climate change graphics through a time
		series with the 'gganimate' package. Function 'amova.rda()'
		shows how Analysis of Molecular Variance can be directly
		conducted with the results from redundancy analysis.
