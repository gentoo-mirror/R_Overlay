		Time Series Prediction with Integrated Tuning // Time series
		prediction is a critical task in data analysis, requiring not
		only the selection of appropriate models, but also suitable
		data preprocessing and tuning strategies. TSPredIT (Time Series
		Prediction with Integrated Tuning) is a framework that provides
		a seamless integration of data preprocessing, decomposition,
		model training, hyperparameter optimization, and evaluation.
		Unlike other frameworks, TSPredIT emphasizes the co-
		optimization of both preprocessing and modeling steps,
		improving predictive performance. It supports a variety of
		statistical and machine learning models, filtering techniques,
		outlier detection, data augmentation, and ensemble strategies.
		More information is available in Salles et al.
