		Optimization Based Ensemble Model for Prediction of Histone
		Modifications in Rice // The comprehensive knowledge of
		epigenetic modifications in plants, encompassing histone
		modifications in regulating gene expression, is not completely
		ingrained. It is noteworthy that histone deacetylation and
		histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) play a role in
		repressing transcription in eukaryotes. In contrast, histone
		acetylation (H3K9ac) and H3K4me3 have been inevitably linked to
		the stimulation of gene expression, which significantly
		influences plant development and plays a role in plant
		responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. To our knowledge this
		the first multiclass classifier for predicting histone
		modification in plants. doi:10.1186/s12864-019-5489-4.
