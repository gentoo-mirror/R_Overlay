		Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models // Provides Generalized
		Inferences based on exact distributions and exact probability
		statements for mixed effect models, provided by such papers as
		Weerahandi and Yu (2020) doi:10.1186/s40488-020-00105-w under
		the widely used Compound Symmetric Covariance structure. The
		package returns the estimation of the coefficients in random
		and fixed part of the mixed models by generalized inference.
