		Variational Inference for Joint Model // The shared random
		effects joint model is one of the most widely used approaches
		to study the associations between longitudinal biomarkers and a
		survival outcome and make dynamic risk predictions using the
		longitudinally measured biomarkers. One major limitation of
		joint models is that they could be computationally expensive
		for complex models where the number of the shared random
		effects is large. This package can be used to fit complex
		multivariate joint models using our newly developed algorithm
		Jieqi Tu and Jiehuan Sun (2023) doi:10.1002/sim.9619, which is
		based on Gaussian variational approximate inference and is
		computationally efficient.
