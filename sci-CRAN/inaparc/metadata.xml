		Initialization Algorithms for Partitioning Cluster Analysis //
		Partitioning clustering algorithms divide data sets into k
		subsets or partitions so-called clusters. They require some
		initialization procedures for starting to partition the data
		sets. Initialization of cluster prototypes is one of such kind
		of procedures for most of the partitioning algorithms. Cluster
		prototypes are the data elements, i.e. centroids or medoids,
		representing the clusters in a data set. In order to initialize
		cluster prototypes, the package 'inaparc' contains a set of the
		functions that are the implementations of several linear time-
		complexity and loglinear time-complexity methods in addition to
		some novel techniques. Initialization of fuzzy membership
		degrees matrices is another important task for starting the
		probabilistic and possibilistic partitioning algorithms. In
		order to initialize membership degrees matrices required by
		these algorithms, a number of functions based on some
		traditional and novel initialization techniques are also
		available in the package 'inaparc'.
