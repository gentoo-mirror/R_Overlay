		Kernel Operations on the GPU, with Autodiff, without Memory
		Overflows // The 'KeOps' library lets you compute generic
		reductions of very large arrays whose entries are given by a
		mathematical formula. It combines a tiled reduction scheme with
		an automatic differentiation engine, and can be used through
		'R', 'Matlab', 'NumPy' or 'PyTorch' backends. It is perfectly
		suited to the computation of Kernel dot products and the
		associated gradients, even when the full kernel matrix does not
		fit into the GPU memory.
