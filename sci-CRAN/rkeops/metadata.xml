		Kernel Operations on GPU or CPU, with Autodiff, without Memory
		Overflows // The 'KeOps' library lets you compute generic
		reductions of very large arrays whose entries are given by a
		mathematical formula with CPU and GPU computing support. It
		combines a tiled reduction scheme with an automatic
		differentiation engine. It is perfectly suited to the efficient
		computation of Kernel dot products and the associated
		gradients, even when the full kernel matrix does not fit into
		the GPU memory.
