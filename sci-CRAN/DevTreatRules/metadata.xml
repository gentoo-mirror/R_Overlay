		Develop Treatment Rules with Observational Data // Develop and
		evaluate treatment rules based on: (1) the standard indirect
		approach of split-regression, which fits regressions separately
		in both treatment groups and assigns an individual to the
		treatment option under which predicted outcome is more
		desirable; (2) the direct approach of outcome-weighted-learning
		proposed by Yingqi Zhao, Donglin Zeng, A. John Rush, and
		Michael Kosorok (2012) doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.695674; (3)
		the direct approach, which we refer to as direct-interactions,
		proposed by Shuai Chen, Lu Tian, Tianxi Cai, and Menggang Yu
		(2017) doi:10.1111/biom.12676. Please see the vignette for a
		walk-through of how to start with an observational dataset
		whose design is understood scientifically and end up with a
		treatment rule that is trustworthy statistically, along with an
		estimation of rule benefit in an independent sample.
