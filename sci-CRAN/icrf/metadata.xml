		Interval Censored Recursive Forests // Implements interval
		censored recursive forests (ICRF) based on Cho, Jewell, and
		Kosorok (2021+). ICRF is a variant of random forests where the
		outcome variable is interval censored survival data. It can be
		used for usual right censored data and current status data as
		well. A recursion technique is used to improve accuracy and
		smoothed survival curves are provided.
