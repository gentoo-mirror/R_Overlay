		Modelling and Simulating Judgments of Frequency // In a typical
		experiment for the intuitive judgment of frequencies (JoF)
		different stimuli with different frequencies are presented. The
		participants consider these stimuli with a constant duration
		and give a judgment of frequency. These judgments can be
		simulated by formal models: PASS 1 and PASS 2 based on
		Sedlmeier (2002, ISBN:978-0198508632), MINERVA 2 baesd on
		Hintzman (1984) doi:10.3758/BF03202365 and TODAM 2 based on
		Murdock, Smith  Bai (2001) doi:10.1006/jmps.2000.1339. The
		package provides an assessment of the frequency by determining
		the core aspects of these four models (attention, decay, and
		presented frequency) that can be compared to empirical results.
