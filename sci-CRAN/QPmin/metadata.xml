		Linearly Constrained Indefinite Quadratic Program Solver //
		Active set method solver for the solution of indefinite
		quadratic programs, subject to lower bounds on linear functions
		of the variables and simple bounds on the variables themselves.
		The function QPmin() implements an algorithm similar to the one
		described in Gould (1991) doi:10.1093/imanum/11.3.299  with the
		exception that an efficient sparse internal representation of
		the basis matrix is maintained thus allowing the solution of
		somewhat large problems.
