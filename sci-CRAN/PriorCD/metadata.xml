		Prioritizing Cancer Drugs for Interested Cancer // Prioritize
		candidate cancer drugs for drug repositioning based on the
		random walk with restart algorithm in a drug-drug functional
		similarity network. 1) We firstly constructed a drug-drug
		functional similarity network by integrating pathway activity
		and drug activity derived from the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. 2)
		Secondly, we calculated drug repurposing score according to a
		set of approved therapeutic drugs of interested cancer based on
		the random walk with restart algorithm in the drug-drug
		functional similarity network. 3) Finally, the permutation test
		was used to calculate the statistical significance level for
		the drug repurposing score.
