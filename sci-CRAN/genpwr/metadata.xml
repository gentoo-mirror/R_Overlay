		Power Calculations Under Genetic Model Misspecification // Power
		and sample size calculations for genetic association studies
		allowing for misspecification of the model of genetic
		susceptibility. "Hum Hered.
		2019;84(6):256-271.doi:10.1159/000508558. Epub 2020 Jul 28."
		Power and/or sample size can be calculated for logistic
		(case/control study design) and linear (continuous phenotype)
		regression models, using additive, dominant, recessive or
		degree of freedom coding of the genetic covariate while
		assuming a true dominant, recessive or additive genetic effect.
		In addition, power and sample size calculations can be
		performed for gene by environment interactions. These methods
		are extensions of Gauderman (2002) doi:10.1093/aje/155.5.478
		and Gauderman (2002) doi:10.1002/sim.973 and are described in:
		Moore CM, Jacobson S, Fingerlin TE. Power and Sample Size
		Calculations for Genetic Association Studies in the Presence of
		Genetic Model Misspecification. American Society of Human
		Genetics. October 2018, San Diego.
