		Data Driving Multiple Classifier System // Provides a novel
		framework to able to automatically develop and deploy an
		accurate Multiple Classifier System based on the feature-
		clustering distribution achieved from an input dataset. 'D2MCS'
		was developed focused on four main aspects: (i) the ability to
		determine an effective method to evaluate the independence of
		features, (ii) the identification of the optimal number of
		feature clusters, (iii) the training and tuning of ML models
		and (iv) the execution of voting schemes to combine the outputs
		of each classifier comprising the Multiple  Classifier System.
