		Extract Statistics from Articles and Recompute P-Values // A
		"spellchecker" for statistics. It checks whether your p-values
		match their accompanying test statistic and degrees of freedom.
		statcheck searches for null-hypothesis significance test (NHST)
		in APA style (e.g., t(28) = 2.2, p  .05). It recalculates the
		p-value using the reported test statistic and degrees of
		freedom. If the reported and computed p-values don't match,
		statcheck will flag the result as an error. If the reported
		p-value is statistically significant and the recomputed one is
		not, or vice versa, the result will be flagged as a decision
		error.  You can use statcheck directly on a string of text, but
		you can also scan a PDF or HTML file, or even a folder of PDF
		and/or HTML files.  Statcheck needs an external program to
		convert PDF to text: Xpdf. Instructions on where and how to
		download this program, how to install statcheck, and more
		details on what statcheck can and cannot do can be found in the
		online manual:
		https://rpubs.com/michelenuijten/statcheckmanual.  You can find
		a point-and-click web interface to scan PDF or HTML or DOCX
		articles on http://statcheck.io.
