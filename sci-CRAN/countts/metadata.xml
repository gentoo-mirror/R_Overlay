		Thomson Sampling for Zero-Inflated Count Outcomes // A
		specialized tool is designed for assessing contextual bandit
		algorithms, particularly those aimed at handling overdispersed
		and zero-inflated count data. It offers a simulated testing
		environment that includes various models like Poisson,
		Overdispersed Poisson, Zero-inflated Poisson, and Zero-inflated
		Overdispersed Poisson. The package is capable of executing five
		specific algorithms: Linear Thompson sampling with log
		transformation on the outcome, Thompson sampling Poisson,
		Thompson sampling Negative Binomial, Thompson sampling Zero-
		inflated Poisson, and Thompson sampling Zero-inflated Negative
		Binomial. Additionally, it can generate regret plots to
		evaluate the performance of contextual bandit algorithms. This
		package is based on the algorithms by Liu et al. (2023)
		arXiv:2311.14359.
