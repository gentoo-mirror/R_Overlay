		A Method to Analyze Recurrent DNA Copy Number Aberrations in
		Tumors // In tumor tissue, underlying genomic instability can
		lead to DNA copy number alterations, e.g., copy number gains or
		losses. Sporadic copy number alterations occur randomly
		throughout the genome, whereas recurrent alterations are
		observed in the same genomic region across multiple independent
		samples, perhaps because they provide a selective growth
		advantage. This package implements the DiNAMIC procedure for
		assessing the statistical significance of recurrent DNA copy
		number aberrations (Bioinformatics (2011) 27(5) 678 - 685).
