		Clustering of Functional Data Based on Measures of Change //
		Implements the three-step procedure proposed by Leffondree et
		al. (2004) to identify clusters of individual longitudinal
		trajectories. The procedure involves (1) calculating a number
		of measures of change capturing various features of the
		trajectories; (2) using a Principal Component Analysis based
		dimension reduction algorithm to select a subset of measures
		and (3) using the K-means clustering algorithm to identify
		clusters of trajectories.
