		Clustering of Functional Data Based on Measures of Change //
		Implements a three-step procedure in the spirit of Leffondre et
		al. (2004) to identify clusters of individual longitudinal
		trajectories. The procedure involves (1) computing a number of
		"measures of change" capturing various features of the
		trajectories; (2) using a Principal Component Analysis based
		dimension reduction algorithm to select a subset of measures
		and (3) using the k-medoids or k-means algorithm to identify
		clusters of trajectories.
