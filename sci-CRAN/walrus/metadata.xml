		Robust Statistical Methods // A toolbox of common robust
		statistical tests, including robust descriptives, robust
		t-tests, and robust ANOVA. It is also available as a module for
		'jamovi' (see https://www.jamovi.org for more information).
		Walrus is based on the WRS2 package by Patrick Mair, which is
		in turn based on the scripts and work of Rand Wilcox. These
		analyses are described in depth in the book 'Introduction to
		Robust Estimation  Hypothesis Testing'.
