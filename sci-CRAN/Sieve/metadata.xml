		Nonparametric Estimation by the Method of Sieves // Performs
		multivariate nonparametric regression/classification by the
		method of sieves (or using orthogonal series). The method is
		suitable for continuous/binary problems with multivariate or
		moderate high-dimensional features (dimension  100). The main
		estimator in this package, penalized sieve estimator, is
		adaptive to the feature dimension with provable theoretical
		guarantees. Moreover, such a method is computationally
		tractable in the sense it typically has a polynomial dependence
		(rather than an exponential one) on the feature dimension and
		an almost linear dependence on the sample size. Details of the
		methods and model assumptions can be found in: Tianyu Zhang,
		and Noah Simon (2022) arXiv:2206.02994.
