		Nonparametric Estimation by the Method of Sieves // Performs
		multivariate nonparametric regression/classification by the
		method of sieves (using orthogonal basis). The method is
		suitable for moderate high-dimensional features (dimension
		100). The l1-penalized sieve estimator, a nonparametric
		generalization of Lasso, is adaptive to the feature dimension
		with provable theoretical guarantees. We also include a
		nonparametric stochastic gradient descent estimator, Sieve-SGD,
		for online or large scale batch problems. Details of the
		methods can be found in: arXiv:2206.02994
		arXiv:2104.00846arXiv:2310.12140.
