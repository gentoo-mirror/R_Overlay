		Dynamic Water Balance a Hydrological Model // A tool to
		hydrologic modelling using the Budyko framework and the Dynamic
		Water Balance model with Dynamical Dimension Search algorithm
		to calibrate the model and analyze the outputs from interactive
		graphics. It allows to calculate the water availability in
		basins and also some water fluxes represented by the structure
		of the model. See Zhang, L., N., Potter, K., Hickel, Y., Zhang,
		Q., Shao (2008) DOI:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.07.021 "Water
		balance modeling over variable time scales based on the Budyko
		framework - Model development and testing", Journal of
		Hydrology, 360, 117131. See Tolson, B., C., Shoemaker (2007)
