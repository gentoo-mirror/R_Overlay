		Transforming Data Between Statistical Classifications // Provides
		support for transformations of numeric aggregates between
		statistical classifications (e.g. occupation or industry
		categorisations) using the 'Crossmaps' framework. Implements
		classes for representing transformations between a source and
		target classification as graph structures, and methods for
		validating and applying crossmaps to transform data collected
		under the source classification into data indexed using the
		target classification codes. Documentation about the
		'Crossmaps' framework is provided in the included vignettes and
		in Huang (2024, doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.14163).
