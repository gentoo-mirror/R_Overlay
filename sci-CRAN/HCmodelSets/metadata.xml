		Regression with a Large Number of Potential Explanatory Variables
		// Software for performing the reduction, exploratory and model
		selection phases of the procedure proposed by Cox, D.R. and
		Battey, H.S. (2017) doi:10.1073/pnas.1703764114 for sparse
		regression when the number of potential explanatory variables
		far exceeds the sample size. The software supports linear
		regression, likelihood-based fitting of generalized linear
		regression models and the proportional hazards model fitted by
		partial likelihood.
