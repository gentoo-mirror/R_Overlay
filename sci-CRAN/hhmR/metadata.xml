		Hierarchical Heatmaps // Allows users to create high-quality
		heatmaps from labelled, hierarchical data. Specifically, for
		data with a two-level hierarchical structure, it will produce a
		heatmap where each row and column represents a category at the
		lower level. These rows and columns are then grouped by the
		higher-level group each category belongs to, with the names for
		each category and groups shown in the margins. While other
		packages (e.g. 'dendextend') allow heatmap rows and columns to
		be arranged by groups only, 'hhmR' also allows the labelling of
		the data at both the category and group level.
