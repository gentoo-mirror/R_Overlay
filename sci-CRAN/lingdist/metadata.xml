		Fast Linguistic Distance and Alignment Computation // A fast
		generalized edit distance and string alignment computation
		mainly for linguistic aims. As a generalization to the classic
		edit distance algorithms, the package allows users to define
		custom cost for every symbol's insertion, deletion, and
		substitution. The package also allows character combinations in
		any length to be seen as a single symbol which is very useful
		for International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions with
		diacritics. In addition to edit distance result, users can get
		detailed alignment information such as all possible alignment
		scenarios between two strings which is useful for testing,
		illustration or any further usage. Either the distance matrix
		or its long table form can be obtained and tools to do such
		conversions are provided. All functions in the package are
		implemented in 'C++' and the distance matrix computation is
		parallelized leveraging the 'RcppThread' package.
