		Fast Generation of von Mises-Fisher Distributed Pseudo-Random
		Vectors // Generates pseudo-random vectors that follow an
		arbitrary von Mises-Fisher distribution on a sphere. This
		method is fast and efficient when generating a large number of
		pseudo-random vectors. Functions to generate random variates
		and compute density for the distribution of an inner product
		between von Mises-Fisher random vector and its mean direction
		are also provided.
