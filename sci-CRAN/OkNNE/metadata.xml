		A k-Nearest Neighbours Ensemble via Optimal Model Selection for
		Regression // Optimal k Nearest Neighbours Ensemble is an
		ensemble of base k nearest neighbour models each constructed on
		a bootstrap sample with a random subset of features. k closest
		observations are identified for a test point "x" (say), in each
		base k nearest neighbour model to fit a stepwise regression to
		predict the output value of "x". The final predicted value of
		"x" is the mean of estimates given by all the models. The
		implemented model takes training and test datasets and trains
		the model on training data to predict the test data. Ali, A.,
		Hamraz, M., Kumam, P., Khan, D.M., Khalil, U., Sulaiman, M. and
