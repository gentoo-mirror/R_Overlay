		Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation // Data-driven approach
		for arriving at person-specific time series models. The method
		first identifies which relations replicate across the majority
		of individuals to detect signal from noise. These group-level
		relations are then used as a foundation for starting the search
		for person-specific (or individual-level) relations. See Gates
