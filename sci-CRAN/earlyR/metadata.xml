		Estimation of Transmissibility in the Early Stages of a Disease
		Outbreak // Implements a simple, likelihood-based estimation of
		the reproduction number (R0) using a branching process with a
		Poisson likelihood. This model requires knowledge of the serial
		interval distribution, and dates of symptom onsets.
		Infectiousness is determined by weighting R0 by the probability
		mass function of the serial interval on the corresponding day.
		It is a simplified version of the model introduced by Cori et
		al. (2013) doi:10.1093/aje/kwt133.
