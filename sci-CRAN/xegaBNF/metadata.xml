		Compile a Backus-Naur Form Specification into an R Grammar Object
		// Translates a BNF (Backus-Naur Form) specification of a
		context-free language into an R grammar object which consists
		of the start symbol, the symbol table, the production table,
		and a short production table. The short production table is
		non-recursive. The grammar object contains the file name from
		which it was generated (without a path). In addition, it
		provides functions to determine the type of a symbol
		(isTerminal() and isNonterminal()) and functions to access the
		production table (rules() and derives()). For the BNF
		specification, see Backus, John et al. (1962) "Revised Report
		on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60". (ALGOL60 standards page
		http://www.algol60.org/2standards.htm, html-edition
		https://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm) The grammar
		compiler is based on the APL2 implementation in Geyer-Schulz,
		Andreas (1997, ISBN:978-3-7908-0830-X).
