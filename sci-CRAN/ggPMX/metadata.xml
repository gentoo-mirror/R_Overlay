		'ggplot2' Based Tool to Facilitate Diagnostic Plots for NLME
		Models // At Novartis, we aimed at standardizing the set of
		diagnostic plots used for modeling activities in order to
		reduce the overall effort required for generating such plots.
		For this, we developed a guidance that proposes an adequate set
		of diagnostics and a toolbox, called 'ggPMX' to execute them.
		'ggPMX' is a toolbox that can generate all diagnostic plots at
		a quality sufficient for publication and submissions using few
		lines of code. This package focuses on plots recommended by
		ISoP doi:10.1002/psp4.12161. While not required, you can
		get/install the 'R' 'lixoftConnectors' package in the 'Monolix'
		installation, as described at the following url
		https://monolixsuite.slp-
		software.com/r-functions/2024R1/installation-and-
		initialization. When 'lixoftConnectors' is available, 'R' can
		use 'Monolix' directly to create the required Chart Data
		instead of exporting it from the 'Monolix' gui.
