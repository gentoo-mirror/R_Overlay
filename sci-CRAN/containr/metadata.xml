		Containerize Your 'R' Project // Automates the process of
		containerizing 'R' projects. The core function of 'containr' is
		'generate_dockerfile()', which analyzes an 'R' project's
		environment and dependencies via an 'renv' lock file and
		generates a ready-to-use 'Dockerfile' that encapsulates the
		computational setup. The package helps researchers build
		portable and consistent workflows so that analyses can be
		reliably shared, archived, and rerun across systems. See R Core
		Team (2025) https://www.R-project.org/, Ushey et al. (2025)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=renv, and Docker Inc. (2025)
