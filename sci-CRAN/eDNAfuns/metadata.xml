		Working with Metabarcoding Data in a Tidy Format // A series of R
		functions that come in handy while working with metabarcoding
		data. The reasoning of doing this is to have the same functions
		we use all the time stored in a curated, reproducible way. In a
		way it is all about putting together the grammar of the
		'tidyverse' from Wickham et al.(2019) doi:10.21105/joss.01686
		with the functions we have used in community ecology compiled
		in packages like 'vegan' from Dixon (2003)
		doi:10.1111/j.1654-1103.2003.tb02228.x and 'phyloseq' McMurdie
		Holmes (2013) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061217. The package
		includes functions to read sequences from FAST(A/Q) into a
		tibble ('fasta_reader' and 'fastq_reader'), to process
		'cutadapt' Martin (2011) doi:10.14806/ej.17.1.200 'info-file'
		output. When it comes to sequence counts across samples, the
		package works with the long format in mind (a three column
		'tibble' with Sample, Sequence and counts ), with functions to
		move from there to the wider format.
