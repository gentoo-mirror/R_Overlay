		A Swiss-Army Knife for Data I/O // Streamlined data import and
		export by making assumptions that the user is probably willing
		to make: 'import()' and 'export()' determine the data structure
		from the file extension, reasonable defaults are used for data
		import and export (e.g., 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'), web-based
		import is natively supported (including from SSL/HTTPS),
		compressed files can be read directly without explicit
		decompression, and fast import packages are used where
		appropriate. An additional convenience function, 'convert()',
		provides a simple method for converting between file types.
