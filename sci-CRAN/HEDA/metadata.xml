		'Hydropeaking Events Detection Algorithm' // This tool identifies
		hydropeaking events from raw time-series flow record, a rapid
		flow variation induced by the hourly-adjusted electricity
		market. The novelty of 'HEDA' is to use vector angle instead of
		the first-order derivative to detect change points which not
		only largely improves the computing efficiency but also
		accounts for the rate of change of the flow variation. More
