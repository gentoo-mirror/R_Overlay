		Tools for Computations with Discrete Splines // Discrete splines
		are a class of univariate piecewise polynomial functions which
		are analogous to splines, but whose smoothness is defined via
		divided differences rather than derivatives. Tools for
		efficient computations relating to discrete splines are
		provided here. These tools include discrete differentiation and
		integration, various matrix computations with discrete
		derivative or discrete spline bases matrices, and interpolation
		within discrete spline spaces. These techniques are described
		in Tibshirani (2020) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2003.03886.
