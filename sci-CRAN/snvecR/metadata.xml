		Calculate Earths Obliquity and Precession in the Past // Easily
		calculate precession and obliquity from an orbital solution
		(defaults to ZB18a from Zeebe and Lourens (2019)
		doi:10.1126/science.aax0612) and assumed or reconstructed
		values for tidal dissipation (Td) and dynamical ellipticity
		(Ed). This is a translation and adaptation of the 'C'-code in
		the supplementary material to Zeebe and Lourens (2022)
		doi:10.1029/2021PA004349, with further details on the
		methodology described in Zeebe (2022)
		doi:10.3847/1538-3881/ac80f8. The name of the 'C'-routine is
		'snvec', which refers to the key units of computation: spin
		vector s and orbit normal vector n.
