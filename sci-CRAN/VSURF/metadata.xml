		Variable Selection Using Random Forests // Three steps variable
		selection procedure based on random forests. Initially
		developed to handle high dimensional data (for which number of
		variables largely exceeds number of observations), the package
		is very versatile and can treat most dimensions of data, for
		regression and supervised classification problems. First step
		is dedicated to eliminate irrelevant variables from the
		dataset. Second step aims to select all variables related to
		the response for interpretation purpose. Third step refines the
		selection by eliminating redundancy in the set of variables
		selected by the second step, for prediction purpose. Genuer, R.
		and Poggi, J.M. and Tuleau-Malot, C. (2015)
