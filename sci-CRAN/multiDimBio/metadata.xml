		Multivariate Analysis and Visualization for Biological Data //
		Code to support a systems biology research program from
		inception through publication.  The methods focus on dimension
		reduction approaches to detect patterns in complex,
		multivariate experimental data and places an emphasis on
		informative visualizations.  The goal for this project is to
		create a package that will evolve over time, thereby remaining
		relevant and reflective of current methods and techniques.  As
		a result, we encourage suggested additions to the package, both
		methodological and graphical.
