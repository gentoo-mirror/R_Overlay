		Multivariate Analysis and Visualization for Biological Data //
		multiDimBio is a package designed to support a systems biology
		research program from inception through publication.  It
		focuses on dimension reduction approaches to detect patterns in
		complex, multivariate experimental data and places an emphasis
		on informative visualizations.  The goal for this project is to
		create a package that will evolve over time, thereby remaining
		relevant and reflective of current methods and techniques.  As
		a result, we encourage suggested additions to the package, both
		methodological and graphical.
