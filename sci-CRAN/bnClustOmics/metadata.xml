		Bayesian Network-Based Clustering of Multi-Omics Data //
		Unsupervised Bayesian network-based clustering of multi-omics
		data. Both binary and continuous data types are allowed as
		inputs. The package serves a dual purpose: it clusters
		(patient) samples and learns the multi-omics networks that
		characterize discovered clusters. Prior network knowledge
		(e.g., public interaction databases) can be included via
		blacklisting and penalization matrices. For clustering, the EM
		algorithm is employed. For structure search at the M-step, the
		Bayesian approach is used. The output includes membership
		assignments of samples, cluster-specific MAP networks, and
		posterior probabilities of all edges in the discovered
		networks. In addition to likelihood, AIC and BIC scores are
		returned. They can be used for choosing the number of clusters.
