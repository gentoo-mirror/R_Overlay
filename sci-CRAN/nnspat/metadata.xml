		Nearest Neighbor Methods for Spatial Patterns // Contains the
		functions for testing the spatial patterns (of segregation,
		spatial symmetry, association, disease clustering, species
		correspondence and reflexivity) based on nearest neighbor
		relations, especially using contingency tables such as nearest
		neighbor contingency tables, nearest neighbor symmetry
		contingency tables, species correspondence contingency tables
		and reflexivity contingency tables for two (or higher)
		dimensional data. Also contains functions for generating
		patterns of segregation, association, uniformity in a multi-
		class setting, and various non-random labeling patterns for
		disease clustering in two dimensional cases, and for
		visualization of all these patterns for the two dimensional
		data. The tests are usually (asymptotic) normal z-tests and
		chi-square tests.
