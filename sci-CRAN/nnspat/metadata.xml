		Nearest Neighbor Methods for Spatial Patterns // Contains the
		functions for testing the spatial patterns (of segregation,
		spatial symmetry, association, disease clustering, species
		correspondence and reflexivity) based on nearest neighbor
		relations, especially using contingency tables such as nearest
		neighbor contingency tables (Ceyhan (2010)
		doi:10.1007/s10651-008-0104-x and Ceyhan (2017)
		doi:10.1016/j.jkss.2016.10.002 and references therein), nearest
		neighbor symmetry contingency tables (Ceyhan (2014)
		doi:10.1155/2014/698296), species correspondence contingency
		tables and reflexivity contingency tables (Ceyhan (2018)
		doi:10.2436/20.8080.02.72) for two (or higher) dimensional
		data. Also contains functions for generating patterns of
		segregation, association, uniformity in a multi-class setting
		(Ceyhan (2014) doi:10.1007/s00477-013-0824-9), and various non-
		random labeling patterns for disease clustering in two
		dimensional cases (Ceyhan (2014) doi:10.1002/sim.6053), and for
		visualization of all these patterns for the two dimensional
		data. The tests are usually (asymptotic) normal z-tests and
		chi-square tests.
