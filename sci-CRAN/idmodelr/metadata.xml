		Infectious Disease Model Library and Utilities // Explore a range
		of infectious disease models in a consistent framework. The
		primary aim of 'idmodelr' is to provide a library of infectious
		disease models for researchers, students, and other interested
		individuals. These models can be used to understand the
		underlying dynamics and as a reference point when developing
		models for research. 'idmodelr' also provides a range of
		utilities. These include: plotting functionality; a simulation
		wrapper; scenario analysis tooling; an interactive dashboard;
		tools for handling mult-dimensional models; and both model and
		parameter look up tables. Unlike other modelling packages such
		as 'pomp' (https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/), 'libbi'
		(http://libbi.org) and 'EpiModel' (http://www.epimodel.or),
		'idmodelr' serves primarily as an educational resource. It is
		most comparable to epirecipes
		(http://epirecip.es/epicookbook/chapters/simple) but provides a
		more consistent framework, an R based workflow, and additional
		utility tooling. After users have explored model dynamics with
		'idmodelr' they may then implement their model using one of
		these packages in order to utilise the model fitting tools they
		provide.  For newer modellers, this package reduces the barrier
		to entry by containing multiple infectious disease models,
		providing a consistent framework for simulation and
		visualisation, and signposting towards other, more research
		focussed, resources.
