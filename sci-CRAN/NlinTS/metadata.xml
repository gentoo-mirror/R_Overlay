		Models for Non Linear Causality Detection in Time Series //
		Models for non-linear time series analysis and causality
		detection. The main functionalities of this package consist of
		an implementation of the classical causality test
		(C.W.J.Granger 1980) doi:10.1016/0165-1889(80)90069-X,  and a
		non-linear version of it based on feed-forward neural networks.
		This package contains also an implementation of the Transfer
		Entropy doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.461, and the continuous
		Transfer Entropy using an approximation based on the k-nearest
		neighbors doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066138. There are also some
		other useful tools, like the VARNN (Vector Auto-Regressive
		Neural Network) prediction model, the Augmented test of
		stationarity, and the discrete and continuous entropy and
		mutual information.
