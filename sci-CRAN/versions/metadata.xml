		Query and Install Specific Versions of Packages on CRAN //
		Installs specified versions of R packages hosted on CRAN and
		provides functions to list available versions and the versions
		of currently installed packages. These tools can be used to
		help make R projects and packages more reproducible. 'versions'
		fits in the narrow gap between the 'devtools' install_version()
		function and the 'checkpoint' package.
		devtools::install_version() installs a stated package version
		from source files stored on the CRAN archives. However CRAN
		does not store binary versions of packages so Windows users
		need to have RTools installed and Windows and OSX users get
		longer installation times. 'checkpoint' uses the Revolution
		Analytics MRAN server to install packages (from source or
		binary) as they were available on a given date. It also
		provides a helpful interface to detect the packages in use in a
		directory and install all of those packages for a given date.
		'checkpoint' doesn't provide install.packages-like
		functionality however, and that's what 'versions' aims to do,
		by querying MRAN. As MRAN only goes back to 2014-09-17,
		'versions' can't install packages from before this date.
