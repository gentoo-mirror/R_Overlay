		Optimal Binning of Continuous and Categorical Variables // Tool
		for easy and efficient discretization of continuous and
		categorical data. The package calculates the most optimal
		binning of a given explanatory variable with respect to a user-
		specified target variable. The purpose is to assign a unique
		Weight-of-Evidence value to each of the calculated binpoints in
		order to recode the original variable. The package allows users
		to impose certain restrictions on the functional form on the
		resulting binning while maximizing the overall information
		value in the original data. The package is well suited for
		logistic scoring models where input variables may be subject to
		restrictions such as linearity by e.g. regulatory authorities.
		An excellent source describing in detail the development of
		scorecards, and the role of Weight-of-Evidence coding in credit
		scoring is (Siddiqi 2006, ISBN: 9780-471754510). The package
		utilizes the discrete nature of decision trees and Isotonic
		Regression to accommodate the trade-off between flexible
		functional forms and maximum information value.
