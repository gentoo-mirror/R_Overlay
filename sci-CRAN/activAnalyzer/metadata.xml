		A 'Shiny' App to Analyze Accelerometer-Measured Daily Physical
		Behavior Data // A tool to analyse 'ActiGraph' accelerometer
		data and to implement the use of the PROactive Physical
		Activity in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
		instruments. Once analysis is completed, the app allows to
		export results to .csv files and to generate a report of the
		measurement. All the configured inputs relevant for
		interpreting the results are recorded in the report. In
		addition to the existing 'R' packages that are fully integrated
		with the app, the app uses some functions from the
		'actigraph.sleepr' package developed by Petkova (2021)
		https://github.com/dipetkov/actigraph.sleepr/.
