		Bayesian Modeling of Spatial Count Data // Provides a collection
		of functions for preparing data and fitting Bayesian count
		spatial regression models, with a specific focus on the Gamma-
		Count (GC) model. The GC model is well-suited for modeling
		dispersed count data, including under-dispersed or over-
		dispersed counts, or counts with equivalent dispersion, using
		Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA). The package
		includes functions for generating data from the GC model, as
		well as spatially correlated versions of the model. See
