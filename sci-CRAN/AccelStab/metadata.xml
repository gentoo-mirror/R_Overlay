		Accelerated Stability Kinetic Modelling // Estimate the
		estkBerggren kinetic model (degradation model) from
		experimental data. A A closed-form (analytic) solution to the
		degradation model is implemented as a non-linear fit, allowing
		for the extrapolation of the degradation of a drug product -
		both in time and temperature. Parametric bootstrap, with
		kinetic parameters drawn from the multivariate t-distribution,
		and analytical formulae (the delta method) are available
		options to calculate the confidence and prediction intervals.
		The results (modelling, extrapolations and statistical
		intervals) can be visualised with multiple plots. The examples
		illustrate the accelerated stability modelling in drugs and
		vaccines development.
