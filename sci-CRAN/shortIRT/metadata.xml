		Procedures Based on Item Response Theory Models for the
		Development of Short Test Forms // Implement different Item
		Response Theory (IRT) based procedures for the development of
		static short test forms (STFs) from a test. Two main procedures
		are considered, specifically the typical IRT-based procedure
		for the development of STF, and a recently introduced procedure
		(Epifania, Anselmi  Robusto, 2022
		doi:10.1007/978-3-031-27781-8_7). The procedures differ in how
		the most informative items are selected for the inclusion in
		the STF, either by considering their item information functions
		without considering any specific level of the latent trait
		(typical procedure) or by considering their informativeness
		with respect to specific levels of the latent trait, denoted as
		theta targets (the newly introduced procedure). Regarding the
		latter procedure, three methods are implemented for the
		definition of the theta targets: (i) theta targets are defined
		by segmenting the latent trait in equal intervals and
		considering the midpoint of each interval (equal interval
		procedure, eip), (ii) by clustering the latent trait to obtain
		unequal intervals and considering the centroids of the clusters
		as the theta targets (unequal intervals procedure, uip), and
		(iii) by letting the user set the specific theta targets of
		interest (user-defined procedure, udp). For further details on
		the procedure, please refer to Epifania, Anselmi  Robusto
		(2022) doi:10.1007/978-3-031-27781-8_7.
