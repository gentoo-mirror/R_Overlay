		Quick Look at your Data // The goal is to print an "aperu", a
		short view of a vector, a matrix, a data.frame, a list or an
		array. By default, it prints the first 5 elements of each
		dimension. By default, the number of columns is equal to the
		number of lines. If you want to control the selection of the
		elements, you can pass a list, with each element being a vector
		giving the selection for each dimension.
