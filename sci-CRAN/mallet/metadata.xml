		An R Wrapper for the Java Mallet Topic Modeling Toolkit // An R
		interface for the Java Machine Learning for Language Toolkit
		(mallet) http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ to estimate probabilistic
		topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We can use
		the R package to read textual data into mallet from R objects,
		run the Java implementation of mallet directly in R, and
		extract results as R objects. The Mallet toolkit has many
		functions, this wrapper focuses on the topic modeling sub-
		package written by David Mimno. The package uses the rJava
		package to connect to a JVM.
