		Clustering Analysis Using Survival Tree and Forest Algorithms //
		An outcome-guided algorithm is developed to identify clusters
		of samples with similar characteristics and survival rate. The
		algorithm first builds a random forest and then defines
		distances between samples based on the fitted random forest.
		Given the distances, we can apply hierarchical clustering
		algorithms to define clusters. Details about this method is
		described in
		https://github.com/luyouepiusf/SurvivalClusteringTree.
