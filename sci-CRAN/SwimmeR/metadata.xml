		Formatting and Conversions for Swimming Times // There are two
		goals for 'SwimmeR' as presently constructed.  First, it
		converts swimming times (performances) between the
		computationally useful format of seconds, reported to the
		100ths place (eg 95.37) and the conventional reporting format
		(1:35.37) used in the swimming community. Secondly 'SwimmeR'
		converts times between the various pool sizes used in
		competitive swimming, namely 50m length (LCM), 25m length (SCM)
		and 25y length (SCY).
