		Data Import, Cleaning, and Conversions for Swimming Results //
		The goal for of the 'SwimmeR' package is to provide means of
		acquiring, and then analyzing, data from swimming (and diving)
		competitions.  To that end 'SwimmeR' allows results to be read
		in from .html sources, like 'Hy-Tek' real time results pages,
		'.pdf' files, 'ISL' results, and (on a development basis)
		'.hy3' files.  Once read in, 'SwimmeR' can convert swimming
		times (performances) between the computationally useful format
		of seconds reported to the '100ths' place (e.g. 95.37), and the
		conventional reporting format (1:35.37) used in the swimming
		community.  'SwimmeR' can also score meets in a variety of
		formats with user defined point values, convert times between
		courses ('LCM', 'SCM', 'SCY') and draw single elimination
		brackets, as well as providing a suite of tools for working
		cleaning swimming data.  This is a developmental package, not
		yet mature.
