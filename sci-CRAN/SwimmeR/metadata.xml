		Formatting and Conversions for Swimming Times // There are two
		goals primary functions 'SwimmeR' as presently constructed.
		First, it reads in swimming results from html or pdf sources
		and returns tidy dataframes.  Second it converts swimming times
		(performances) between the computationally useful format of
		seconds, reported to the 100ths place (eg 95.37) and the
		conventional reporting format (1:35.37) used in the swimming
		community. Additionally 'SwimmeR' converts times between the
		various pool sizes used in competitive swimming, namely 50m
		length (LCM), 25m length (SCM) and 25y length (SCY).
