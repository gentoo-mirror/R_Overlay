		Data Import, Cleaning, and Conversions for Swimming Results //
		There are two goals for 'SwimmeR' as presently constructed.
		The first is reading in swimming results from html or pdf
		sources and returning tidy dataframes.  The second is working
		with the resulting data.  To this end 'SwimmeR' converts
		swimming times (performances) between the computationally
		useful format of seconds, reported to the 100ths place (e.g.
		95.37), and the conventional reporting format (1:35.37) used in
		the swimming community, as well as providing tools for
		assigning team names etc. Additionally 'SwimmeR' has functions
		for drawing single-elimination brackets and also converts times
		between the various pool sizes used in competitive swimming,
		namely 50m length (LCM), 25m length (SCM) and 25y length (SCY).
