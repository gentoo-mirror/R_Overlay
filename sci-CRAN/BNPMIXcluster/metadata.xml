		Bayesian Nonparametric Model for Clustering with Mixed Scale
		Variables // Bayesian nonparametric approach for clustering
		that is capable to combine different types of variables
		(continuous, ordinal and nominal) and also accommodates for
		different sampling probabilities in a complex survey design.
		The model is based on a location mixture model with a Poisson-
		Dirichlet process prior on the location parameters of the
		associated latent variables. The package performs the
		clustering model described in Carmona, C., Nieto-Barajas, L.
		E., Canale, A. (2016) arXiv:1612.00083.
