		Bayesian Nonparametric Model for Clustering with Mixed Scale
		Variables // Model-based approach for clustering of
		multivariate data, capable of combining different types of
		variables (continuous, ordinal and nominal) and accommodating
		for different sampling probabilities in a complex survey
		design. The model is based on a location mixture model with a
		Poisson-Dirichlet process prior on the location parameters of
		the associated latent variables. Details of the underlying
		model is described in Carmona, C., Nieto-Barajas, L. E.,
		Canale, A. (2016) arXiv:1612.00083.
