		Create Dendrograms and Tree Diagrams Using 'ggplot2' // This is a
		set of tools for dendrograms and tree plots using 'ggplot2'.
		The 'ggplot2' philosophy is to clearly separate data from the
		presentation. Unfortunately the plot method for dendrograms
		plots directly to a plot device without exposing the data. The
		'ggdendro' package resolves this by making available functions
		that extract the dendrogram plot data. The package provides
		implementations for 'tree', 'rpart', as well as diana and agnes
		(from 'cluster') diagrams.
