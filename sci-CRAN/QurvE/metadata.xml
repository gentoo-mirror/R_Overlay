		Robust and User-Friendly Analysis of Growth and Fluorescence
		Curves // High-throughput analysis of growth curves and
		fluorescence data using three methods: linear regression,
		growth model fitting, and smooth spline fit. Analysis of dose-
		response relationships via smoothing splines or dose-response
		models. Complete data analysis workflows can be executed in a
		single step via user-friendly wrapper functions. The results of
		these workflows are summarized in detailed reports as well as
		intuitively navigable 'R' data containers. A 'shiny'
		application provides access to all features without requiring
		any programming knowledge. The package is described in further
		detail in Wirth et al. (2023) doi:10.1038/s41596-023-00850-7.
