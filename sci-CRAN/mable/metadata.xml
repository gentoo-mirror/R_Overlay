		Maximum Approximate Bernstein/Beta Likelihood Estimation // Fit
		data from a continuous population with a smooth density on
		finite interval by an approximate Bernstein polynomial model
		which is a mixture of certain beta distributions and find
		maximum approximate Bernstein likelihood estimator of the
		unknown coefficients. Consequently, maximum likelihood
		estimates of the unknown density, distribution functions, and
		more can be obtained. If the support of the density is not the
		unit interval then transformation can be applied. This is an
		implementation of the methods proposed by the author of this
		package published in the Journal of Nonparametric Statistics:
		Guan (2016) doi:10.1080/10485252.2016.1163349 and Guan (2017)
		doi:10.1080/10485252.2017.1374384. For data with covariates,
		under some semiparametric regression models such as Cox
		proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time
		model, the baseline survival function can be estimated smoothly
		based on general interval censored data.
