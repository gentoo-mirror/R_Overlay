		Maximum Approximate Bernstein Likelihood Estimation // Fit raw or
		grouped continuous data from a population with a smooth density
		on unit interval by an approximate Bernstein polynomial model
		which is a mixture of certain beta distributions and find
		maximum approximate Bernstein likelihood estimator of the
		unknown coefficients. Consequently, maximum likelihood
		estimates of the unknown density, distribution functions, and
		more can be obtained. If the support of the density is not the
		unit interval then transformation can be applied. This is an
		implementation of the methods proposed by the author this
		package published in the Journal of Nonparametric Statistics:
		Guan (2016) doi:10.1080/10485252.2016.1163349 and Guan (2017)
