		Interactive Exploration of Contour Data // Interactive tools to
		explore topographic-like data sets.  Such data sets take the
		form of a matrix in which the rows and columns provide
		location/frequency information, and the matrix elements contain
		altitude/response information.  Such data is found in
		cartography, 2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.  The functions
		in this package create interactive web pages showing the
		contoured data, possibly with slices from the original matrix
		parallel to each dimension. The interactive behavior is created
		using the 'D3.js' 'JavaScript' library by Mike Bostock.
