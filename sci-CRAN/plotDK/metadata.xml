		Plot Summary Statistics as Choropleth Maps of Danish
		Administrative Areas // Provides a ggplot2 front end to plot
		summary statistics on danish provinces, regions,
		municipalities, and zipcodes. The needed geoms of each of the
		four levels are inherent in the package, thus making these
		types of plots easy for the user. This is essentially an
		updated port of the previously available 'mapDK' package by
		Sebastian Barfort.
