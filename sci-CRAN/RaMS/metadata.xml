		R Access to Mass-Spec Data // R-based access to mass-spectrometry
		(MS) data. While many packages exist to process MS data, many
		of these make it difficult to access the underlying mass-to-
		charge ratio (m/z), intensity, and retention time of the files
		themselves. This package is designed to format MS data in a
		tidy fashion and allows the user perform the plotting and
		analysis.
