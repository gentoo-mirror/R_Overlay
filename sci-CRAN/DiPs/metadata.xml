		Directional Penalties for Optimal Matching in Observational
		Studies // Improves the balance of optimal matching with near-
		fine balance by giving penalties on the unbalanced covariates
		with the unbalanced directions. Many directional penalties can
		also be viewed as Lagrange multipliers, pushing a matched
		sample in the direction of satisfying a linear constraint that
		would not be satisfied without penalization. Yu, R., and
		Rosenbaum, P. R. (2019). doi:10.1111/biom.13098.
