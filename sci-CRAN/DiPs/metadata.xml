		Directional Penalties for Optimal Matching in Observational
		Studies // Improves the balance of optimal matching with near-
		fine balance by giving penalties on the unbalanced covariates
		with the unbalanced directions. Many directional penalties can
		also be viewed as Lagrange multipliers, pushing a matched
		sample in the direction of satisfying a linear constraint that
		would not be satisfied without penalization. Rosenbaum, P.R.
		(1989). DOI:10.1080/01621459.1989.10478868. Yang, D., Small, D.
		S., Silber, J. H., and Rosenbaum, P. R. (2012).
