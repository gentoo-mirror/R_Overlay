		A Quantum Computer Simulator // A quantum computer simulator
		framework with up to 24 qubits. It allows to define general
		single qubit gates and general controlled single qubit gates.
		For convenience, it currently provides the most common gates
		(X, Y, Z, H, Z, S, T, Rx, Ry, Rz, CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli or CCNOT,
		Fredkin or CSWAP). 'qsimulatR' also implements noise models.
		'qsimulatR' supports plotting of circuits and is able to export
		circuits to 'Qiskit' https://qiskit.org/, a python package
		which can be used to run on IBM's hardware https://quantum-
		computing.ibm.com/.
