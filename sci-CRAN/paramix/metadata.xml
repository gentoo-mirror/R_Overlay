		Aggregate and Disaggregate Continuous Parameters for
		Compartmental Models // A convenient framework for aggregating
		and disaggregating continuously varying parameters (for
		example, case fatality ratio, with age) for proper
		parametrization of lower-resolution compartmental models (for
		example, with broad age categories) and subsequent upscaling of
		model outputs to high resolution (for example, as needed when
		calculating age-sensitive measures like years-life-lost).
