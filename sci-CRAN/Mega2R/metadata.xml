		Accessing and Processing a 'Mega2' Genetic Database // Uses as
		input genetic data that have been reformatted and stored in a
		'SQLite' database; this database is initially created by the
		standalone 'mega2' C++ program (available freely from
		https://watson.hgen.pitt.edu/register/). Loads and manipulates
		data frames containing genotype, phenotype, and family
		information from the input 'SQLite' database, and decompresses
		needed subsets of the genotype data, on the fly, in a memory
		efficient manner.  We have also created several more functions
		that illustrate how to use the data frames as well as perform
		useful tasks: these permit one to run the 'pedgene' package to
		carry out gene-based association tests on family data using
		selected marker subsets, to run the 'SKAT' package to carry out
		gene-based association tests using selected marker subsets, to
		run the 'famSKATRC' package to carry out gene-based association
		tests on families (optionally) and with rare or common variants
		using selected marker subsets, to output the 'Mega2R' data as a
		VCF file and related files (for phenotype and family data), and
		to convert the data frames into CoreArray Genomic Data
		Structure (GDS) format.
