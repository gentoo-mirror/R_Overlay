		Easily Handling Data from the m-Path Platform // Provides tools
		for importing and cleaning Experience Sampling Method (ESM)
		data collected via the 'm-Path' platform. The goal is to
		provide with a few utility functions to be able to read and
		perform some common operations in ESM data collected through
		the 'm-Path' platform (https://m-path.io/landing/). Functions
		include raw data handling, format standardization, and basic
		data checks, as well as to calculate the response rate in data
		from ESM studies.
