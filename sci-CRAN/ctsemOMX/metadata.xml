		Continuous Time SEM - 'OpenMx' Based Functions // Original
		'ctsem' (continuous time structural equation modelling)
		functionality, based on the 'OpenMx' software, as described in
		Driver, Oud, Voelkle (2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i05, with
		updated details in vignette. Combines stochastic differential
		equations representing latent processes with structural
		equation measurement models. These functions were split off
		from the main package of 'ctsem', as the main package uses the
		'rstan' package as a backend now -- offering estimation options
		from max likelihood to Bayesian. There are nevertheless use
		cases for the wide format SEM style approach as offered here,
		particularly when there are no individual differences in
		observation timing and the number of individuals is large. For
		the main 'ctsem' package, see
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctsem.
