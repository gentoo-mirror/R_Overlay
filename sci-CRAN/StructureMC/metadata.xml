		Structured Matrix Completion // Provides an efficient method to
		recover the missing block of an approximately low-rank matrix.
		Current literature on matrix completion focuses primarily on
		independent sampling models under which the individual observed
		entries are sampled independently. Motivated by applications in
		genomic data integration, we propose a new framework of
		structured matrix completion (SMC) to treat structured
		missingness by design [Cai T, Cai TT, Zhang A (2016)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1021005]. Specifically, our proposed
		method aims at efficient matrix recovery when a subset of the
		rows and columns of an approximately low-rank matrix are
		observed. The main function in our package, smc.FUN(), is for
		recovery of the missing block A22 of an approximately low-rank
		matrix A given the other blocks A11, A12, A21.
