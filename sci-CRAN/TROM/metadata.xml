		Transcriptome Overlap Measure // A new bioinformatic tool for
		comparing transcriptomes of two biological samples from the
		same or different species. The mapping is conducted based on
		the overlap of the associated genes of different samples. More
		examples and detailed explanations are available in the
		vignette. For detailed description of the method, please refer
		to Li, Wei Vivian, Yiling Chen, and Jingyi Jessica Li. "TROM: A
		testing-based method for finding transcriptomic similarity of
		biological samples." Statistics in biosciences 9.1 (2017):
		105-136 doi:10.1007/s12561-016-9163-y.
