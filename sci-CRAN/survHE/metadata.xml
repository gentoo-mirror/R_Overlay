		Survival Analysis in Health Economic Evaluation // Contains a
		suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics.
		These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist
		(based on maximum likelihood) or a Bayesian approach (both
		based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian
		Monte Carlo). To run the Bayesian models, the user needs to
		install additional modules (packages), i.e. 'survHEinla' and
		'survHEhmc'. These can be installed from
		https://giabaio.r-universe.dev/ using
		'install.packages("survHEhmc", repos =
		c("https://giabaio.r-universe.dev",
		"https://cloud.r-project.org"))' and
		'install.packages("survHEinla", repos =
		c("https://giabaio.r-universe.dev",
		"https://cloud.r-project.org"))' respectively. 'survHEinla' is
		based on the package INLA, which is available for download at
		https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable/. The user can
		specify a set of parametric models using a common notation and
		select the preferred mode of inference. The results can also be
		post-processed to produce probabilistic sensitivity analysis
		and can be used to export the output to an Excel file (e.g. for
		a Markov model, as often done by modellers and practitioners).
