		Survival Analysis in Health Economic Evaluation // Contains a
		suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics.
		These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist
		(based on maximum likelihood) or a Bayesian approach (both
		based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian
		Monte Carlo). The user can specify a set of parametric models
		using a common notation and select the preferred mode of
		inference. The results can also be post-processed to produce
		probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used to export
		the output to an Excel file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often
		done by modellers and practitioners).
