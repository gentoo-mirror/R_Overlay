		Simulating and Analysing Transmission Chain Statistics Using
		Branching Process Models // Provides methods to simulate and
		analyse the size and length of branching processes with an
		arbitrary offspring distribution. These can be used, for
		example, to analyse the distribution of chain sizes or length
		of infectious disease outbreaks, as discussed in Farrington et
		al. (2003) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.279.
