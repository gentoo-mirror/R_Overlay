		Group Elastic Net Regularized GLM // Efficient algorithms for
		fitting generalized linear models with group elastic net
		penalties. Implements group lasso, group MCP, and group SCAD
		with an optional group ridge penalty. Computes the
		regularization path for linear regression (gaussian), logistic
		regression (binomial), multinomial logistic regression
		(multinomial), log-linear count regression (poisson and
		negative binomial), and log-linear continuous regression (gamma
		and inverse gaussian). Regularization paths are computed using
		groupwise majorization descent. Cross-validation routines are
		available for tuning the regularization parameters.
