		Group Elastic Net Regularized GLMs and GAMs // Efficient
		algorithms for fitting generalized linear and additive models
		with group elastic net penalties as described in Helwig (2024)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2024.2362232. Implements group LASSO,
		group MCP, and group SCAD with an optional group ridge penalty.
		Computes the regularization path for linear regression
		(gaussian), logistic regression (binomial), multinomial
		logistic regression (multinomial), log-linear count regression
		(poisson and negative.binomial), and log-linear continuous
		regression (gamma and inverse gaussian). Supports default and
		formula methods for model specification, k-fold cross-
		validation for tuning the regularization parameters, and
		nonparametric regression via tensor product reproducing kernel
		(smoothing spline) basis function expansion.
