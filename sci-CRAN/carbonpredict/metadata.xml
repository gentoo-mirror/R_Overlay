		Predict Carbon Emissions for UK SMEs // Predict Scope 1, 2 and 3
		carbon emissions for UK Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
		(SMEs), using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes
		and annual turnover data. The 'carbonpredict' package provides
		single and batch prediction, plotting, and workflow tools for
		carbon accounting and reporting. The package utilises pre-
		trained models, leveraging rich classified transaction data to
		accurately predict Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions for UK
		SMEs as well as identifying emissions hotspots. The methodology
		used to produce the estimates in this package is fully detailed
		in the following peer-reviewed publication in the Journal of
		Industrial Ecology: Phillpotts, A., Owen. A., Norman, J.,
		Trendl, A.,  Gathergood, J., Jobst, Norbert., Leake, D. (2025)
		doi:10.1111/jiec.70106 "Bridging the SME Reporting Gap: A New
		Model for Predicting Scope 1 and 2 Emissions".
