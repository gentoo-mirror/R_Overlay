		Miscellaneous Tools Set // A collection of miscellaneous methods
		to simplify various tasks, including plotting, data.frame and
		matrix transformations, environment functions, regular
		expression methods, and string and logical operations, as well
		as numerical and statistical tools. Most of the methods are
		simple but useful wrappers of common base R functions, which
		extend S3 generics or provide default values for important
		parameters.
