		Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis Results Data Object
		// Provides a flexible container to manage and annotate
		Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis results (Smythe et.
		al (2015) doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007). The DGEobj has data slots
		for row (gene), col (samples), assays (matrix n-rows by
		m-samples dimensions) and metadata (not keyed to row, col, or
		assays). A set of accessory functions to deposit, query and
		retrieve subsets of a data workflow has been provided.
		Attributes are used to capture metadata such as species and
		gene model, including reproducibility information such that a
		3rd party can access a DGEobj history to see how each data
		object was created or modified.  Since the DGEobj is
		customizable and extensible it is not limited to RNA-seq
		analysis types of workflows -- it can accommodate nearly any
		data analysis workflow that starts from a matrix of assays
		(rows) by samples (columns).
