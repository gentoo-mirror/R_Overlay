		Statistical Analysis of Textual Data // Provides a set of
		functions devoted to multivariate exploratory statistics on
		textual data. Classical methods such as correspondence analysis
		and agglomerative hierarchical clustering are available.
		Chronologically constrained agglomerative hierarchical
		clustering enriched with labelled-by-words trees is offered.
		Given a division of the corpus into parts, their characteristic
		words and documents are identified. Further, accessing to
		'FactoMineR' functions is very easy. Two of them are relevant
		in textual domain. MFA() addresses multiple lexical table
		allowing applications such as dealing with multilingual corpora
		as well as simultaneously analyzing both open-ended and closed
		questions in surveys. CaGalt() helps to explore the
		relationships between lexical choices and contextual variables.
		See http://www.Xplortext.org for examples.
