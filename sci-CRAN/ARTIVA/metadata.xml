		Time-Varying DBN Inference with the ARTIVA (Auto Regressive TIme
		VArying) Model // Reversible Jump MCMC (RJ-MCMC)sampling for
		approximating the posterior distribution of a time varying
		regulatory network, under the Auto Regressive TIme VArying
		(ARTIVA) model (for a detailed description of the algorithm,
		see Lebre et al. BMC Systems Biology, 2010). Starting from
		time-course gene expression measurements for a gene of interest
		(referred to as "target gene") and a set of genes (referred to
		as "parent genes") which may explain the expression of the
		target gene, the ARTIVA procedure identifies temporal segments
		for which a set of interactions occur between the "parent
		genes" and the "target gene". The time points that delimit the
		different temporal segments are referred to as changepoints
		(CP).
