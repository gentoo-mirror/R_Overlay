		An Implementation of the Hedged Random Forest Algorithm // This
		algorithm is described in detail in the paper "Hedging Forecast
		Combinations With an Application to the Random Forest" by Beck
		et al. (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.15384. The package
		provides a function hedgedrf() that can be used to train a
		Hedged Random Forest model on a dataset, and a function
		predict.hedgedrf() that can be used to make predictions with
		the model.
