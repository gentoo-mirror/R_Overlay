		An Implementation of the Hedged Random Forest Algorithm // This
		algorithm is described in detail in the paper "Hedging Forecast
		Combinations With an Application to the Random Forest" by Beck
		et al. (2024)
		https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5032102.
		The package provides a function hedgedrf() that can be used to
		train a Hedged Random Forest model on a dataset, and a function
		predict.hedgedrf() that can be used to make predictions with
		the model.
