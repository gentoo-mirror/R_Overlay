		Simple Matrix Construction // Constructing matrices for quick
		prototyping can be a nuisance, requiring the user to think
		about how to fill the matrix with values using the matrix()
		function. The %-% operator solves that issue by allowing the
		user to construct matrices using code that shows the actual
		matrices.
