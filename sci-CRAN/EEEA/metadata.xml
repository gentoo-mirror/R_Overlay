		Explicit Exploration Strategy for Evolutionary Algorithms //
		Implements an explicit exploration strategy for evolutionary
		algorithms in order to have a more effective search in solving
		optimization problems. Along with this exploration search
		strategy, a set of four different Estimation of Distribution
		Algorithms (EDAs) are also implemented for solving optimization
		problems in continuous domains. The implemented explicit
		exploration strategy in this package is described in Salinas-
		Gutirrez and Muoz Zavala (2023) doi:10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110230.
