		A Web-Based Graphics Device for Animated Visualisations //
		Implements a web-based graphics device for animated
		visualisations. Modelled on the 'base' syntax, it extends the
		'base' graphics functions to support frame-by-frame animation
		and keyframes animation. The target use cases are real-time
		animated visualisations, including agent-based models,
		dynamical systems, and animated diagrams. The generated
		visualisations can be deployed as GIF images / MP4 videos, as
		'Shiny' apps (with interactivity) or as HTML documents through
		embedding into R Markdown documents.
