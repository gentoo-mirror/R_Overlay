		Sequential Bagging on Regression // Methodology: Remove one
		observation. Training the rest of data that are sampled without
		replacement and given this observation's input, predict the
		response back. Replicate this N times and for each response,
		take a sample from these replicates with replacement. Average
		each responses of sample and again replicate this step N time
		for each observation. Approximate these N new responses and
		generate another N responses y'. Training these y' and predict
		to have N responses of each testing observation. The average of
		N is the final prediction. Each observation will do the same.
