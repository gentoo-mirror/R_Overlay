		Using KEEL in R Code // 'KEEL' is a popular Java software for a
		large number of different knowledge data discovery tasks. This
		package takes the advantages of 'KEEL' and R, allowing to use
		'KEEL' algorithms in simple R code. The implemented R code
		layer between R and 'KEEL' makes easy both using 'KEEL'
		algorithms in R as implementing new algorithms for 'RKEEL' in a
		very simple way. It includes more than 100 algorithms for
		classification, regression, preprocess, association rules and
		imbalance learning, which allows a more complete
		experimentation process. For more information about KEEL, see
		http://www.keel.es/.
