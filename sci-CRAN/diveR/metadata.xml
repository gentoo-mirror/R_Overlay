		Easily Install and Load Interactive Data Visualization Tools // A
		suite of 'loon' related packages providing data analytic tools
		for Direct Interactive Visual Exploration in R ('diveR'). These
		tools work with and complement those of the 'tidyverse' suite,
		extending the grammar of 'ggplot2' to become a grammar of
		interactive graphics. The suite provides many visual tools
		designed for moderately (100s of variables) high dimensional
		data analysis, through 'zenplots' and novel tools in 'loon',
		and extends the 'ggplot2' grammar to provide parallel
		coordinates, Andrews plots, and arbitrary glyphs through
		'ggmulti'. The  'diveR' package gathers together and installs
		all these related packages in a single step.
