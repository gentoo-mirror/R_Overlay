		Dose-Finding Methods for Non-Binary Outcomes // In many phase I
		trials, the design goal is to find the dose associated with a
		certain target toxicity rate. In some trials, the goal can be
		to find the dose with a certain weighted sum of rates of
		various toxicity grades. For others, the goal is to find the
		dose with a certain mean value of a continuous response. This
		package provides the setup and calculations needed to run a
		dose-finding trial with non-binary endpoints and performs
		simulations to assess designs operating characteristics under
		various scenarios. Three dose finding designs are included in
		this package: unified phase I design (Ivanova et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.01045.x), Quasi-CRM/Robust-Quasi-
		CRM (Yuan et al. (2007) doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00666.x,
		Pan et al. (2014) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098147) and
		generalized BOIN design (Mu et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1111/rssc.12263). The toxicity endpoints can be handled
		with these functions including equivalent toxicity score (ETS),
		total toxicity burden (TTB), general continuous toxicity
		endpoints, with incorporating ordinal grade toxicity
		information into dose-finding procedure. These functions allow
		customization of design characteristics to vary sample size,
		cohort sizes, target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rates,
		discrete or continuous toxicity score, and incorporate safety
		and/or stopping rules.
