		Markov Chain Models for Phylogenetic Trees // Allows for fitting
		of maximum likelihood models using Markov chains on
		phylogenetic trees for analysis of discrete character data.
		Examples of such discrete character data include restriction
		sites, gene family presence/absence, intron presence/absence,
		and gene family size data. Hypothesis-driven user- specified
		substitution rate matrices can be estimated. Allows for
		biologically realistic models combining constrained
		substitution rate matrices, site rate variation, site
		partitioning, branch-specific rates, allowing for non-
		stationary prior root probabilities, correcting for sampling
		bias, etc. See Dang and Golding (2016)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv541 for more details.
