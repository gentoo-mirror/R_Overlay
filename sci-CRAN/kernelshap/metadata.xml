		Kernel SHAP // Multidimensional version of the iterative Kernel
		SHAP algorithm described in Ian Covert and Su-In Lee (2021)
		http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a.  SHAP values are
		calculated iteratively until convergence, along with
		approximate standard errors.  The package allows to work with
		any model that provides numeric predictions of dimension one or
		higher.  Examples include linear regression, logistic
		regression (logit or probability scale), other generalized
		linear models, generalized additive models, and neural
		networks.  The package plays well together with meta-learning
		packages like 'tidymodels', 'caret' or 'mlr3'. Visualizations
		can be done using the R package 'shapviz'.
