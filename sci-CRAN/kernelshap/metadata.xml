		Kernel SHAP // Multidimensional refinement of the Kernel SHAP
		algorithm described in Ian Covert and Su-In Lee (2021)
		http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a.  The package
		allows to calculate Kernel SHAP values in an exact way, by
		iterative sampling (as in the reference above), or by a hybrid
		of the two.  As soon as sampling is involved, the algorithm
		iterates until convergence, and standard errors are provided.
		The package works with any model that provides numeric
		predictions of dimension one or higher.  Examples include
		linear regression, logistic regression (on logit or probability
		scale), other generalized linear models, generalized additive
		models, and neural networks.  The package plays well together
		with meta-learning packages like 'tidymodels', 'caret' or
		'mlr3'. Visualizations can be done using the R package
		'shapviz'.
