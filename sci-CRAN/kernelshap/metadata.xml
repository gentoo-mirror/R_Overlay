		Kernel SHAP // Implementation of the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP
		algorithm by Ian Covert and Su-In Lee (2021)
		http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a.  Due to its
		iterative nature, standard errors of the SHAP values are
		provided and convergence is monitored.  The package allows to
		work with any model that provides numeric predictions.
		Examples include linear regression, logistic regression (logit
		or probability scale), other generalized linear models,
		generalized additive models, and neural networks. The package
		plays well together with meta-learning packages like 'caret' or
		'mlr3'. Visualizations can be done using the R package
		'shapviz'.
