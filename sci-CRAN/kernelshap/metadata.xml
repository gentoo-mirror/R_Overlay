		Kernel SHAP // Efficient implementation of Kernel SHAP (Lundberg
		and Lee, 2017, doi:10.48550/arXiv.1705.07874) permutation SHAP,
		and additive SHAP for model interpretability.  For Kernel SHAP
		and permutation SHAP, if the number of features is too large
		for exact calculations, the algorithms iterate until the SHAP
		values are sufficiently precise in terms of their standard
		errors.  The package integrates smoothly with meta-learning
		packages such as 'tidymodels', 'caret' or 'mlr3'. It supports
		multi-output models, case weights, and parallel computations.
		Visualizations can be done using the R package 'shapviz'.
