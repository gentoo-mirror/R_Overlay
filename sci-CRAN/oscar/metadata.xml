		Optimal Subset Cardinality Regression (OSCAR) Models Using the
		L0-Pseudonorm // Optimal Subset Cardinality Regression (OSCAR)
		models offer regularized linear regression using the
		L0-pseudonorm, conventionally known as the number of non-zero
		coefficients. The package estimates an optimal subset of
		features using the L0-penalization via cross-validation,
		bootstrapping and visual diagnostics. Effective Fortran
		implementations are offered along the package for finding
		optima for the DC-decomposition, which is used for transforming
		the discrete L0-regularized optimization problem into a
		continuous non-convex optimization task. These optimization
		modules include DBDC ('Double Bundle method for nonsmooth DC
		optimization' as described in Joki et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1137/16M1115733) and LMBM ('Limited Memory Bundle Method
		for large-scale nonsmooth optimization' as in Haarala et al.
		(2004) doi:10.1080/10556780410001689225). The OSCAR models are
		comprehensively exemplified in Halkola et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010333). Multiple regression model
		families are supported: Cox, logistic, and Gaussian.
