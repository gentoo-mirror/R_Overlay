		Linkage disequilibrium corrected by the structure and the
		relatedness // The package provides a set of functions which
		aim is to propose four measures of linkage disequilibrium: the
		usual r^2 measure, the r^2_S measure (r^2 corrected by the
		structure sample), the r^2_V (r^2 corrected by the relatedness
		of genotyped individuals), the r^2_VS measure (r^2 corrected by
		both the relatedness of genotyped individuals and the structure
		of the sample).
