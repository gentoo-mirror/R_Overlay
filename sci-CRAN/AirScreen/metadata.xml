		Feature Screening via Adaptive Iterative Ridge (Air-HOLP and Air-
		OLS) // Implements two complementary high-dimensional feature
		screening methods, Adaptive Iterative Ridge High-dimensional
		Ordinary Least-squares Projection (Air-HOLP, suitable when the
		number of predictors p is greater than or equal to the sample
		size n) and Adaptive Iterative Ridge Ordinary Least Squares
		(Air-OLS, for n greater than p). Also  provides helper
		functions to generate compound-symmetry and AR(1) correlated
		data, plus a unified Air() front end and a summary method. For
		methodological details see Joudah, Muller and Zhu (2025)
