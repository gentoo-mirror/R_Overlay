		Attribute Sampling Plan with Exact Hypergeometric Probabilities
		using Chebyshev Polynomials // Implements an algorithm for
		efficient and exact calculation of hypergeometric and binomial
		probabilities using Chebyshev polynomials, while other
		algorithm use an approximation when N is large. A useful
		applications is also considered in this package for the
		construction of attribute sampling plans which is an important
		field of statistical quality control. The quantile, and the
		confidence limit for the attribute sampling plan are also
		implemented in this package. The hypergeometric distribution
		can be represented in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This
		representation is particularly useful in the calculation of
		exact values of hypergeometric variables.
