		A Two-Stage Estimation Approach to Cox Regression Using M-Spline
		Function // Implements a two-stage estimation approach for Cox
		regression using five-parameter M-spline functions to model the
		baseline hazard. It allows for flexible hazard shapes and model
		selection based on log-likelihood criteria as described in
		Teranishi et al.(2025). In addition, the package provides
		functions for constructing and evaluating B-spline copulas
		based on five M-spline or I-spline basis functions, allowing
		users to flexibly model and compute bivariate dependence
		structures. Both the copula function and its density can be
		evaluated. Furthermore, the package supports computation of
		dependence measures such as Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho,
		derived analytically from the copula parameters.
