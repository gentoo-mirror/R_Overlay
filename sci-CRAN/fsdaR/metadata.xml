		Robust Data Analysis Through Monitoring and Dynamic Visualization
		// Provides interface to the 'MATLAB' toolbox 'Flexible
		Statistical Data Analysis (FSDA)' which is a comprehensive and
		computationally efficient software package for robust
		statistics in regression, multivariate and categorical data
		analysis. The current R version implements tools for
		regression: (forward search, S- and MM-estimation, least
		trimmed squares (LTS) and least median of squares (LMS)). The
		distinctive feature of our regression package relies in the
		possibility of monitoring the statistics of interest as
		function of breakdown point, efficiency or subset size,
		depending on the estimator. This is accompanied by a rich set
		of graphical features, such as dynamic brushing, linking,
		particularly useful for exploratory data analysis.
