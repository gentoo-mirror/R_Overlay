		Two Dimensional High Throughput 'GoMiner' // The Gene Ontology
		(GO) Consortium https://geneontology.org/ organizes genes into
		hierarchical categories based on biological process (BP),
		molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC, i.e.,
		subcellular localization). Tools such as 'GoMiner' (see
		Zeeberg, B.R., Feng, W., Wang, G. et al. (2003)
		doi:10.1186/gb-2003-4-4-r28) can leverage GO to perform
		ontological analysis of microarray and proteomics studies,
		typically generating a list of significant functional
		categories. Microarray studies are usually analyzed with BP,
		whereas proteomics researchers often prefer CC. To capture the
		benefit of both of those ontologies, I developed a two-
		dimensional version of 'High-Throughput GoMiner' ('HTGM2D'). I
		generate a 2D heat map whose axes are any two of BP, MF, or CC,
		and the value within a picture element of the heat map reflects
		the Jaccard metric p-value for the number of genes in common
		for the corresponding pair.
