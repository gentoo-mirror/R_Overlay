		'Python' Style String Functions // A comprehensive set of string
		manipulation functions based on those found in 'Python' without
		relying on 'reticulate'. It provides functions that intend to
		(1) make it easier for users familiar with 'Python' to work
		with strings, (2) reduce the complexity often associated with
		string operations, (3) and enable users to write more readable
		and maintainable code that manipulates strings.
