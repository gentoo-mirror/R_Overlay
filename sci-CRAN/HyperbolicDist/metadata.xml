		The Hyperbolic Distribution // Maintenance has been discontinued
		for this package. It has been superseded by
		'GeneralizedHyperbolic'. 'GeneralizedHyperbolic' includes all
		the functionality of 'HyperbolicDist' and more and is based on
		a more rational design. 'HyperbolicDist' provides functions for
		the hyperbolic and related distributions. Density, distribution
		and quantile functions and random number generation are
		provided for the hyperbolic distribution, the generalized
		hyperbolic distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian
		distribution and the skew-Laplace distribution. Additional
		functionality is provided for the hyperbolic distribution,
		including fitting of the hyperbolic to data.
