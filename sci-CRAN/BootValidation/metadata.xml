		Adjusting for Optimism in 'glmnet' Regression using Bootstrapping
		// Main objective of a predictive model is to provide accurated
		predictions of a new observations. Unfortunately we don't know
		how well the model performs. In addition, at the current era of
		omic data where p  n, is not reasonable applying internal
		validation using data-splitting. Under this background a good
		method to assessing model performance is applying internal
		bootstrap validation (Harrell Jr, Frank E (2015)
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-3462-1.) This package provides bootstrap
		validation for the linear and logistic 'glmnet' models.
