		Graph Signal Processing // Provides the standard operations for
		signal processing on graphs: graph Fourier transform, spectral
		graph wavelet transform, visualization tools. It also
		implements a data driven method for graph signal
		denoising/regression, for details see De Loynes, Navarro,
		Olivier (2019) arxiv:1906.01882. The package also provides an
		interface to the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection,
		https://sparse.tamu.edu/, a large and widely used set of sparse
		matrix benchmarks collected from a wide range of applications.
