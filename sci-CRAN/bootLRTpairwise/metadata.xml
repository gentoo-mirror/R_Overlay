		Bootstrap Hypothesis Tests for Treatment Effects in One-Way ANOVA
		with Unequal Variances // Implements three test procedures
		using bootstrap resampling techniques for assessing treatment
		effects in one-way ANOVA models with unequal variances
		(heteroscedasticity). It includes a parametric bootstrap
		likelihood ratio test (PB_LRT()), a pairwise parametric
		bootstrap mean test (PPBMT()), and a Rademacher wild pairwise
		non-parametric bootstrap test (RWPNPBT()). These methods
		provide robust alternatives to classical ANOVA and standard
		pairwise comparisons when the assumption of homogeneity of
		variances is violated.
