		Multi-Resolution Scanning for Cross-Sample Differences // An
		implementation of the MRS algorithm for comparison across
		distributions, as described in Jacopo Soriano, Li Ma (2017)
		doi:10.1111/rssb.12180. The model is based on a nonparametric
		process taking the form of a Markov model that transitions
		between a "null" and an "alternative" state on a multi-
		resolution partition tree of the sample space. MRS effectively
		detects and characterizes a variety of underlying differences.
		These differences can be visualized using several plotting
		functions.
