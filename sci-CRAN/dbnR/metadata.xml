		Dynamic Bayesian Network Learning and Inference // Learning and
		inference over dynamic Bayesian networks of arbitrary Markovian
		order.  Extends some of the functionality offered by the
		'bnlearn' package to learn the networks from data and perform
		exact inference. It offers a modification of Trabelsi (2013)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-642-41398-8_34 dynamic max-min hill climbing
		algorithm for structure learning and the possibility to perform
		forecasts of arbitrary length. A tool for visualizing the
		structure of the net is also provided via the 'visNetwork'
		package.
