		Principal Component of Explained Variance // Principal component
		of explained variance (PCEV) is a statistical tool for the
		analysis of a multivariate response vector. It is a dimension-
		reduction technique, similar to Principal component analysis
		(PCA), that seeks to maximize the proportion of variance (in
		the response vector) being explained by a set of covariates.
