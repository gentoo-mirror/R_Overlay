		Automated Construction of R Data Packages from REDCap Projects //
		Export all data, including metadata, from a REDCap (Research
		Electronic Data Capture) Project via the REDCap API
		https://projectredcap.org/wp-
		content/resources/REDCapTechnicalOverview.pdf. The exported
		(meta)data will be processed and formatted into a stand alone R
		data package which can be installed and shared between
		researchers.  Several default reports are generated as
		vignettes in the resulting package.
