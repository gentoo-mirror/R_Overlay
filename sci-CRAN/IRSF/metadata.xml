		Interaction Random Survival Forest // Builds ensemble survival
		tree models to reveal variable interactions when the response
		is a time-to-events outcome. Codes contain randomization,
		interaction modeling, and prediction subroutines to be used in
		addition to the following R packages: 'survival' for Kaplan-
		Meier and Cox regression modeling, 'randomForestSRC' for RSF
		modeling, and optionally 'ggRandomForests' for Random Forest
		exploration/visualization. The current version contains
		additional R codes in folder "/inst/doc" for the analysis and
		generation of results shown in the corresponding article
		(Dazard et al. (2018) doi:10.1515/sagmb-2017-0038).
