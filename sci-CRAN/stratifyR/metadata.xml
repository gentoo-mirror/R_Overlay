		Optimal Stratification of Univariate Populations // The
		stratification of univariate populations under stratified
		sampling designs is implemented according to Khan et al. (2002)
		doi:10.1177/0008068320020518 and Khan et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1080/02664763.2015.1018674 in this library. It
		determines the Optimum Strata Boundaries (OSB) and Optimum
		Sample Sizes (OSS) for the study variable, y, using the best-
		fit frequency distribution of a survey variable (if data is
		available) or a hypothetical distribution (if data is not
		available). The method formulates the problem of determining
		the OSB as mathematical programming problem which is solved by
		using a dynamic programming technique. If a dataset of the
		population is available to the surveyor, the method estimates
		its best-fit distribution and determines the OSB and OSS under
		Neyman allocation directly. When the dataset is not available,
		stratification is made based on the assumption that the values
		of the study variable, y, are available as hypothetical
		realizations of proxy values of y from recent surveys. Thus, it
		requires certain distributional assumptions about the study
		variable. At present, it handles stratification for the
		populations where the study variable follows a continuous
		distribution, namely, Pareto, Triangular, Right-triangular,
		Weibull, Gamma, Exponential, Uniform, Normal, Log-normal and
		Cauchy distributions.
