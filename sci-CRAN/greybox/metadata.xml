		Toolbox for Model Selection and Combinations for the Forecasting
		Purposes // Implements model selection and combinations via
		information criteria based on the values of partial
		correlations. This allows, for example, solving "fat
		regression" problems, where the number of variables is much
		larger than the number of observations. This is driven by the
		research on information criteria, which is well discussed in
		Burnham  Anderson (2002) doi:10.1007/b97636, and currently
		developed further by Ivan Svetunkov and Yves Sagaert (working
		paper in progress). Models developed in the package are
		tailored specifically for forecasting purposes. So as a results
		there are several methods that allow producing forecasts from
		these models and visualising them.
