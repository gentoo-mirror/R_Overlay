		Toolbox for Model Building and Forecasting // Implements
		functions and instruments for regression model building and its
		application to forecasting. The main scope of the package is in
		variables selection and models specification for cases of time
		series data. This includes promotional modelling, selection
		between different dynamic regressions with non-standard
		distributions of errors, selection based on cross validation,
		solutions to the fat regressions model problem and more. Models
		developed in the package are tailored specifically for
		forecasting purposes. So as a results there are several methods
		that allow producing forecasts from these models and
		visualising them.
