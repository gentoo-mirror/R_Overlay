		Spatial Extent Tools // Functions to produce a fully fledged
		'geo-spatial' object extent as a 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'.
		Also included are functions to generate polygons from raster
		data using 'quadmesh' techniques, a round number buffered
		extent, and general spatial-extent and 'raster-like' extent
		helpers missing from the originating packages. Some latitude-
		based tools for polar maps are included.
