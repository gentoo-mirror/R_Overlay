		Mitigating Spatial Bias Through Geographical Complexity // The
		geographical complexity of individual variables can be
		characterized by the differences in local attribute variables,
		while the common geographical complexity of multiple variables
		can be represented by fluctuations in the similarity of vectors
		composed of multiple variables. In spatial regression tasks,
		the goodness of fit can be improved by incorporating a
		geographical complexity representation vector during modeling,
		using a geographical complexity-weighted spatial weight matrix,
		or employing local geographical complexity kernel density.
		Similarly, in spatial sampling tasks, samples can be selected
		more effectively by using a method that weights based on
		geographical complexity. By optimizing performance in spatial
		regression and spatial sampling tasks, the spatial bias of the
		model can be effectively reduced.
