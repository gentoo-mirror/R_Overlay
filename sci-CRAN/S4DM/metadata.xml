		Small Sample Size Species Distribution Modeling // Implements a
		set of distribution modeling methods that are suited to species
		with small sample sizes (e.g., poorly sampled species or rare
		species). While these methods can also be used on well-sampled
		taxa, they are united by the fact that they can be utilized
		with relatively few data points. More details on the currently
		implemented methodologies can be found in Drake and Richards
		(2018) doi:10.1002/ecs2.2373, Drake (2015)
