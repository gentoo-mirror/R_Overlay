		Sensitivity Analysis Tools for Dependence and Asymptotic
		Dependence // Tools for analyzing tail dependence in any sample
		or in particular theoretical models.  The package uses only
		theoretical and non parametric methods, without inference.  The
		primary goals of the package are to provide: (a)symmetric
		multivariate extreme value models in any dimension;
		theoretical and empirical indices to order tail dependence;
		theoretical and empirical graphical methods to visualize tail
		dependence.
