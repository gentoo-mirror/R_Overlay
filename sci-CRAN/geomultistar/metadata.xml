		Multidimensional Queries Enriched with Geographic Data //
		Multidimensional systems allow complex queries to be carried
		out in an easy way. The geographical dimension, together with
		the temporal dimension, plays a fundamental role in
		multidimensional systems. Through this package, vector
		geographic data layers can be associated to the attributes of
		geographic dimensions, so that the results of multidimensional
		queries can be obtained directly as vector layers.  The
		multidimensional structures on which we can define the queries
		can be created from a flat table or imported directly using
		functions from this package.
