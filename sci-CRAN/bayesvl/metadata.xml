		Visually Learning the Graphical Structure of Bayesian Networks
		and Performing MCMC with 'Stan' // Provides users with its
		associated functions for pedagogical purposes in visually
		learning Bayesian networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		computations. It enables users to: a) Create and examine the
		(starting) graphical structure of Bayesian networks; b) Create
		random Bayesian networks using a dataset with customized
		constraints; c) Generate 'Stan' code for structures of Bayesian
		networks for sampling the data and learning parameters; d) Plot
		the network graphs; e) Perform Markov chain Monte Carlo
		computations and produce graphs for posteriors checks. The
		package refers to one reference item, which describes the
		methods and algorithms: Vuong, Quan-Hoang and La, Viet-Phuong
		(2019) doi:10.31219/osf.io/w5dx6 The 'bayesvl' R package. Open
		Science Framework (May 18).
