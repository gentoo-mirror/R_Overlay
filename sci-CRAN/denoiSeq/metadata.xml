		Differential Expression Analysis Using a Bottom-Up Model // Given
		count data from two conditions, it determines which transcripts
		are differentially expressed across the two conditions using
		Bayesian inference of the parameters of  a bottom-up model for
		PCR amplification. This model is  developed in Ndifon Wilfred,
		Hilah Gal, Eric Shifrut, Rina Aharoni, Nissan Yissachar, Nir
		Waysbort, Shlomit Reich Zeliger, Ruth Arnon, and Nir Friedman
		(2012), http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15865.full, and
		results in a distribution for the counts that is a
		superposition of the binomial and negative binomial
		distribution.
