		Robustness Checks for Omitted Variable Bias // Robustness checks
		for omitted variable bias. The package includes robustness
		checks proposed by Oster (2019). robomit the estimate i) the
		bias-adjusted treatment correlation or effect and ii) the
		degree of selection on unobservables relative to observables
		(with respect to the treatment variable) that would be
		necessary to eliminate the result based on the framework by
		Oster (2019). Additionally, robomit offers a set of sensitivity
		analysis and visualization functions. See: Oster, E. 2019.
