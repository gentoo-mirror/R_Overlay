		Biomarker Optimal Segmentation System // The Biomarker Optimal
		Segmentation System R package, 'bossR', is designed for
		precision medicine, helping to identify individual traits using
		biomarkers. It focuses on determining the most effective cutoff
		value for a continuous biomarker, which is crucial for
		categorizing patients into two groups with distinctly different
		clinical outcomes. The package simultaneously finds the optimal
		cutoff from given candidate values and tests its significance.
		Simulation studies demonstrate that 'bossR' offers statistical
		power and false positive control non-inferior to the
		permutation approach (considered the gold standard in this
		field), while being hundreds of times faster.
