		Subroutines to Estimate Rolling Window Multiple Correlation //
		Rolling Window Multiple Correlation ('RolWinMulCor') estimates
		the rolling (running) window correlation for the bi- and multi-
		variate cases between regular (sampled on identical time
		points) time series, with especial emphasis to environmental
		data (although this can be applied to other kinds of data
		sets). 'RolWinMulCor' is based on the concept of rolling or
		running window and is useful to evaluate the evolution of
		correlation through time and time-scales. 'RolWinMulCor'
		contains four functions: (1) the first two functions are focus
		on the bi-variate case, one of them produces a simple plot of
		correlation coefficients and p-values (=0.05) for only one
		window-length (time-scale), and the other function produces a
		heat map for the statistically significant (p-values =0.05)
		correlation coefficients taking into account all the possible
		window-lengths (which are determined by the number of elements
		of the time series under analysis) or for a band of window-
		lengths; (2) the second two functions are designed to analyse
		the multi-variate case and follow the bi-variate case to
		display visually the results although these two methods are
		different. The four functions contained in  'RolWinMulCor' are
		highly flexible since this contains a great number of
		parameters to control the estimation of correlation and the
		features of the plot output, e.g. to remove the (linear) trend
		contained in the time series under analysis, to choose
		different p-value correction methods (which are used to address
		the multiple comparison problem) or to personalise the plot
		output (e.g. this can be displayed in the screen or can be
		saved as PNG, JPEG, EPS or PDF formats). The 'RolWinMulCor'
		package also provides examples with synthetic and real
		environmental time series to exemplify its use. Methods derived
