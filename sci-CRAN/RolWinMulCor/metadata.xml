		Subroutines to Estimate Rolling Window Multiple Correlation //
		Rolling Window Multiple Correlation ('RolWinMulCor') estimates
		the rolling (running) window correlation for the bi- and multi-
		variate cases between regular (sampled on identical time
		points) time series, with especial emphasis to ecological data
		although this can be applied to other kinds of data sets.
		'RolWinMulCor' is based on the concept of rolling, running or
		sliding window and is useful to evaluate the evolution of
		correlation through time and time-scales. 'RolWinMulCor'
		contains six functions. The first two focus on the bi-variate
		case: (1) rolwincor_1win() and (2) rolwincor_heatmap(), which
		estimate the correlation coefficients and the their respective
		p-values for only one window-length (time-scale) and
		considering all possible window-lengths or a band of window-
		lengths, respectively. The second two functions: (3)
		rolwinmulcor_1win() and (4) rolwinmulcor_heatmap() are designed
		to analyze the multi-variate case, following the bi-variate
		case to visually display the results, but these two approaches
		are methodologically different. That is, the multi-variate case
		estimates the adjusted coefficients of determination instead of
		the correlation coefficients. The last two functions: (5)
		plot_1win() and (6) plot_heatmap() are used to represent
		graphically the outputs of the four aforementioned functions as
		simple plots or as heat maps. The functions contained in
		'RolWinMulCor' are highly flexible since these contains several
		parameters to control the estimation of correlation and the
		features of the plot output, e.g. to remove the (linear) trend
		contained in the time series under analysis, to choose
		different p-value correction methods (which are used to address
		the multiple comparison problem) or to personalise the plot
		outputs. The 'RolWinMulCor' package also provides examples with
		synthetic and real-life ecological time series to exemplify its
		use. Methods derived from H. Abdi. (2007)
