		Network Visualization Using 'sigma.js' // Interactive
		visualizations of graphs created with the 'igraph' package
		using a 'htmlwidgets' wrapper for the 'sigma.js' network
		visualization v2.4.0 https://www.sigmajs.org/, enabling to
		display several thousands of nodes. While several 'R' packages
		have been developed to interface 'sigma.js', all were developed
		for v1.x.x and none have migrated to v2.4.0 nor are they
		planning to. This package builds upon the 'sigmaNet' package,
		and users familiar with it will recognize the similar design
		approach. Two extensions have been added to the classic
		'sigma.js' visualizations by overriding the underlying
		'JavaScript' code, enabling to draw a frame around node labels,
		and to display labels on multiple lines by parsing line breaks.
		Other additional functionalities that did not require
		overriding 'sigma.js' code include toggling node visibility
		when clicked using a node attribute and highlighting specific
		edges. 'sigma.js' is currently preparing a stable release
		v3.0.0, and this package plans to update to it when it is
		available.
