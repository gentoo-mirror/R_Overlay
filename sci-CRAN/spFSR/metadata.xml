		Feature Selection and Ranking via Simultaneous Perturbation
		Stochastic Approximation // An implementation of feature
		selection, weighting and ranking via simultaneous perturbation
		stochastic approximation (SPSA). The SPSA-FSR algorithm
		searches for a locally optimal set of features that yield the
		best predictive performance using some error measures such as
		mean squared error (for regression problems) and accuracy rate
		(for classification problems).
