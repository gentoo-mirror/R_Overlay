		Feature Selection and Ranking by Simultaneous Perturbation
		Stochastic Approximation // An implementation of feature
		selection and ranking via simultaneous perturbation stochastic
		approximation (SPSA-FSR) based on works by V. Aksakalli and M.
		Malekipirbazari (2015) arXiv:1508.07630 and Zeren D. Yenice and
		et al. (2018) arXiv:1804.05589. The SPSA-FSR algorithm searches
		for a locally optimal set of features that yield the best
		predictive performance using a specified error measure such as
		mean squared error (for regression problems) and accuracy rate
		(for classification problems). This package requires an object
		of class 'task' and an object of class 'Learner' from the 'mlr'
		package.
