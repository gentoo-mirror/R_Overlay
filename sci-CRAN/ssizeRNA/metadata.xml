		Sample Size Calculation for RNA-Seq Experimental Design // We
		propose a procedure for sample size calculation while
		controlling false discovery rate for RNA-seq experimental
		design. Our procedure depends on the Voom method proposed for
		RNA-seq data analysis by Law et al. (2014)
		DOI:10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29 and the sample size calculation
		method proposed for microarray experiments by Liu and Hwang
		(2007) DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl664. We develop a set of
		functions that calculates appropriate sample sizes for two-
		sample t-test for RNA-seq experiments with fixed or varied set
		of parameters. The outputs also contain a plot of power versus
		sample size, a table of power at different sample sizes, and a
		table of critical test values at different sample sizes. To
		install this package, please use
		'source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");
		biocLite("ssizeRNA")'. For R version 3.5 or greater, please use
		'if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly =
		TRUE)){install.packages("BiocManager")};
		BiocManager::install("ssizeRNA")'.
