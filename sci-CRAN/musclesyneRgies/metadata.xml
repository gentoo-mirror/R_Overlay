		Extract Muscle Synergies from Electromyography // Provides a
		framework to factorise electromyography (EMG) data. Tools are
		provided for raw data pre-processing, non negative matrix
		factorisation, classification of factorised data and plotting
		of obtained outcomes. In particular, reading from ASCII files
		is supported, along with wide-used filtering approaches to
		process EMG data. All steps include one or more sensible
		defaults that aim at simplifying the workflow. Yet, all
		functions are largely tunable at need. Example data sets are
		included.
