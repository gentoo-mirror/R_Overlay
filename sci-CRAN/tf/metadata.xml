		S3 Classes and Methods for Tidy Functional Data // Defines S3
		vector data types for vectors of functional data (grid-based,
		spline-based or functional principal components-based) with all
		arithmetic and summary methods, derivation, integration and
		smoothing, plotting, data import and export, and data
		wrangling, such as re-evaluating, subsetting, sub-assigning,
		zooming into sub-domains, or extracting functional features
		like minima/maxima and their locations. The implementation
		allows including such vectors in data frames for joint analysis
		of functional and scalar variables.
