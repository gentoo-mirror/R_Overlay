		'Rcpp' Bindings for the 'simdjson' Header-Only Library for 'JSON'
		Parsing // The 'JSON' format is ubiquitous for data
		interchange, and the 'simdjson' library written by Daniel
		Lemire (and many contributors) provides a high-performance
		parser for these files which by relying on parallel 'SIMD'
		instruction manages to parse these files as faster than disk
		speed. See the arXiv:1902.08318 paper for more details about
		'simdjson'.  This package parses 'JSON' from string, file, or
		remote URLs under a variety of settings.
