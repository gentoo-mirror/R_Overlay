		Bayesian Distributed Lag Interaction Models // Estimation and
		interpretation of Bayesian distributed lag interaction models
		(BDLIMs). A BDLIM regresses a scalar outcome on repeated
		measures of exposure and allows for modification by a
		categorical variable under four specific patterns of
		modification. The main function is bdlim(). There are also
		summary and plotting files. Details on methodology are
		described in Wilson et al. (2017)
