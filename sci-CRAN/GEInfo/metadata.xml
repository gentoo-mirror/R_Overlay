		Gene-Environment Interaction Analysis Incorporating Prior
		Information // Realize three approaches for Gene-Environment
		interaction analysis. All of them adopt Sparse Group Minimax
		Concave Penalty to identify important G variables and G-E
		interactions, and simultaneously respect the hierarchy between
		main G and G-E interaction effects. All the three approaches
		are available for Linear, Logistic, and Poisson regression.
		Also realize to mine and construct prior information for G
		variables and G-E interactions.
