		Multivariate Data Analysis Laboratory // An open-source
		implementation of latent variable methods and multivariate
		modeling tools. The focus is on exploratory analyses using
		dimensionality reduction methods including low dimensional
		embedding, classical multivariate statistical tools, and tools
		for enhanced interpretation of machine learning methods (i.e.
		intelligible models to provide important information for end-
		users).   Target domains include extension to dedicated
		applications e.g. for manufacturing process modeling,
		spectroscopic analyses, and data mining.
