		Syllable Counting and Readability Measurements // An English

		'Coleman-Liau' (Coleman and 'Liau' 1975) doi:10.1037/h0076540.
		The package has been carefully optimized and should be very
		efficient, both in terms of run time performance and memory
		consumption. The main methods are 'vectorized' by document, and
		scores for multiple documents are computed in parallel via
		'OpenMP'.
