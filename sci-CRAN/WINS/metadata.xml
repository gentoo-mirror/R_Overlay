		The R WINS Package // Calculate the win statistics (win ratio,
		net benefit and win odds) for prioritized multiple endpoints,
		plot the win statistics and win proportions over study time if
		at least one time-to-event endpoint is analyzed, and simulate
		datasets with dependent endpoints. The package can handle any
		type of outcomes (continuous, ordinal, binary, time-to-event)
		and allow users to perform stratified analysis, inverse
		probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) and inverse
		probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis.
