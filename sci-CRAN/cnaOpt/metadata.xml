		Optimizing Consistency and Coverage in Configurational Causal
		Modeling // This is an add-on to the 'cna' package
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cna comprising various
		functions for optimizing consistency and coverage scores of
		models of configurational comparative methods as Coincidence
		Analysis (CNA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). The
		function conCovOpt() calculates con-cov optima, selectMax()
		selects con-cov maxima among the con-cov optima, DNFbuild() can
		be used to build models actually reaching those optima, and
		findOutcomes() identifies those factor values in analyzed data
		that can be modeled as outcomes. For a theoretical introduction
		to these functions see Baumgartner and Ambuehl (2021)
		doi:10.1177/0049124121995554.
