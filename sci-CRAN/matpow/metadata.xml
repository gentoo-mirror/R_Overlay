		Matrix Powers // A general framework for computing powers of
		matrices.  A key feature is the capability for users to write
		callback functions, called after each iteration, thus enabling
		customization for specific applications.  Diverse types of
		matrix classes/matrix multiplication are accommodated.  If the
		multiplication type computes in parallel, then the package
		computation is also parallel.
