		A Pipeline to Process Single Cell RNAseq Data // A pipeline that
		can process single or multiple Single Cell RNAseq samples
		primarily specializes in Clustering and Dimensionality
		Reduction. Meanwhile we use common cell type marker genes for T
		cells, B cells, Myeloid cells, Epithelial cells, and stromal
		cells (Fiboblast, Endothelial cells, Pericyte, Smooth muscle
		cells) to visualize the Seurat clusters, to facilitate labeling
		them by biological names. Once users named each cluster, they
		can evaluate the quality of them again and find the de novo
		marker genes also.
