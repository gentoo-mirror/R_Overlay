		Adding Progress Bar to '*apply' Functions // A lightweight
		package that adds progress bar to vectorized R functions
		('*apply'). The implementation can easily be added to functions
		where showing the progress is useful (e.g. bootstrap). The type
		and style of the progress bar (with percentages or remaining
		time) can be set through options. Supports several parallel
		processing backends including future.
