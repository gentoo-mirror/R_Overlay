		Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation with 'graphicalVAR' //
		Data-driven approach for arriving at person-specific time
		series models from within a Graphical Vector Autoregression
		(VAR) framework. The method first identifies which relations
		replicate across the majority of individuals to detect signal
		from noise. These group-level relations are then used as a
		foundation for starting the search for person-specific (or
		individual-level) relations. All estimates are obtained
		uniquely for each individual in the final models. The method
		for the 'graphicalVAR' approach is found in Epskamp, Waldorp,
		Mottus  Borsboom (2018) doi:10.1080/00273171.2018.1454823.
