		Spatial Estimation and Prediction for Censored/Missing Responses
		// It provides functions to estimate the parameters in spatial
		models with censored/missing responses via the Expectation-
		Maximization (EM) algorithm (see Dempster, Laird, and Rubin
		(1977)https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984875), the Stochastic
		Approximation EM (SAEM) algorithm (see Delyon, Lavielle, and
		Moulines (1999)https://www.jstor.org/stable/120120), and the
		Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm (see Wei and Tanner
		(1990)doi:10.1080/01621459.1990.10474930). These algorithms are
		widely used to compute the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates in
		incomplete data problems. The EM algorithm computes the ML
		estimates when a closed expression for the conditional
		expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function is
		available. In the MCEM algorithm, the conditional expectation
		is substituted by a Monte Carlo approximation based on many
		independent simulations of the missing data, while the SAEM
		algorithm splits the E-step into a simulation step and an
		integration step. The SAEM algorithm was developed as an
		alternative to the computationally intensive MCEM algorithm.
		This package also approximates the standard error of the
		estimates using the method developed by Louis
		(1982)https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345828. It also has a
		function that performs spatial prediction in a set of new
		locations. Besides the functions to estimate parameters, this
		package allows computing the covariance matrix and the distance
		matrix.
