		Spatial Estimation and Prediction for Censored/Missing Responses
		// It provides functions to estimate parameters in linear
		spatial models with censored/missing responses via the
		Expectation-Maximization (EM), the Stochastic Approximation EM
		(SAEM), or the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm. These
		algorithms are widely used to compute the maximum likelihood
		(ML) estimates in problems with incomplete data. The EM
		algorithm computes the ML estimates when a closed expression
		for the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-
		likelihood function is available. In the MCEM algorithm, the
		conditional expectation is substituted by a Monte Carlo
		approximation based on many independent simulations of the
		missing data. In contrast, the SAEM algorithm splits the E-step
		into simulation and integration steps. This package also
		approximates the standard error of the estimates using the
		Louis method. Moreover, it has a function that performs spatial
		prediction in new locations.
