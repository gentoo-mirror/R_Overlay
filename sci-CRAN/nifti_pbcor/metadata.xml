		Parcel-Based Correlation Between NIfTI Images // Estimate the
		correlation between two NIfTI images across random
		parcellations of the images (Fortea et al., under review). This
		approach overcomes the problems of both voxel-based
		correlations (neighbor voxels may be spatially dependent) and
		atlas-based correlations (the correlation may depend on the
		atlas used).
