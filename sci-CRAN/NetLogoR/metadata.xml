		Build and Run Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Models // Build and
		run spatially explicit agent-based models using only the R
		platform. 'NetLogoR' follows the same framework as the
		'NetLogo' software (Wilensky (1999) https://www.netlogo.org)
		and is a translation in R of the structure and functions of
		'NetLogo'. 'NetLogoR' provides new R classes to define model
		agents and functions to implement spatially explicit agent-
		based models in the R environment. This package allows
		benefiting of the fast and easy coding phase from the highly
		developed 'NetLogo' framework, coupled with the versatility,
		power and massive resources of the R software. Examples of two
		models from the NetLogo software repository (Ants
		https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants) and Wolf-
		Sheep-Predation (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Wo
		lfSheepPredation), and a third, Butterfly, from Railsback and
		Grimm (2012) https://www.railsback-grimm-abm-book.com/, all
		written using 'NetLogoR' are available. The 'NetLogo' code of
		the original version of these models is provided alongside. A
		programming guide inspired from the 'NetLogo' Programming Guide
		(https://docs.netlogo.org/programming.html) and a dictionary of
		'NetLogo' primitives (https://docs.netlogo.org/dictionary.html)
		equivalences are also available. NOTE: To increment 'time',
		these functions can use a for loop or can be integrated with a
		discrete event simulator, such as 'SpaDES'
		(https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES).
