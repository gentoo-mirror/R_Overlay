		Build and Run Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Models // Build and
		run spatially explicit agent-based models using only the R
		platform. 'NetLogoR' follows the same framework as the
		'NetLogo' software (Wilensky (1999)
		http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and is a translation in R
		of the structure and functions of 'NetLogo'. 'NetLogoR'
		provides new R classes to define model agents and functions to
		implement spatially explicit agent-based models in the R
		environment. This package allows benefiting of the fast and
		easy coding phase from the highly developed 'NetLogo'
		framework, coupled with the versatility, power and massive
		resources of the R software. Examples of two models from the
		NetLogo software repository (Ants
		http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants) and Wolf-
		Sheep-Predation (http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Wol
		fSheepPredation), and a third, Butterfly, from Railsback and
		Grimm (2012) https://www.railsback-grimm-abm-book.com/, all
		written using 'NetLogoR' are available. The 'NetLogo' code of
		the original version of these models is provided alongside. A
		programming guide inspired from the 'NetLogo' Programming Guide
		(https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html)
		and a dictionary of 'NetLogo' primitives
		(https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html)
		equivalences are also available. NOTE: To increment 'time',
		these functions can use a for loop or can be integrated with a
		discrete event simulator, such as 'SpaDES'
		(https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES). The suggested
		package 'fastshp' can be installed with
		'install.packages("fastshp", repos = ("https://rforge.net"),
		type = "source")'.
