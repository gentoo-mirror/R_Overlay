		A Port of 'NetLogo' Functions and Language to R // Easily create
		agent-based models in R following the 'NetLogo' framework
		(Wilensky, 1999; http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
		'NetLogoR' provides classes to represent 'patches' (raster
		cells) and 'turtles' (individuals), the necessary 'NetLogo'
		primitives
		(https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html),
		and complementary functions to easily build agent-based models
		or translate 'NetLogo' models in R. A programming guide derived
		from the 'NetLogo' Programming Guide
		(https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html)
		and a dictionary of 'NetLogo' primitives
		(https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html)
		equivalences are available. As examples, three 'NetLogo' models
		(Ants, http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants;
		Butterfly, Railsback and Grimm, 2012; Wolf-Sheep-Predation,
		http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation)
		were translated in R language using 'NetLogoR'. NOTE: To
		increment 'time', these functions can use a for loop or can be
		integrated with a discrete event simulator, such as 'SpaDES'
		(https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES). The suggested
		package 'fastshp' can be installed with
		'install.packages("fastshp", repos = "https://rforge.net", type
		= "source")'.
