		Hysteretic and Gatekeeping Depressions Model // Implementation of
		the Hysteretic and Gatekeeping Depressions Model (HGDM) which
		calculates variable connected/contributing areas and resulting
		discharge volumes in prairie basins dominated by depressions
		("slough" or "potholes"). The small depressions are combined
		into a single "meta" depression which explicitly models the
		hysteresis between the storage of water and the
		connected/contributing areas of the depressions. The largest
		(greater than 5% of the total depressional area) depression (if
		it exists) is represented separately to model its gatekeeping,
		i.e. the blocking of upstream flows until it is filled. The
		methodolgy is described in detail in Shook and Pomeroy (2025,
		doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132821).
