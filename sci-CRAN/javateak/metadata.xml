		Javanese Teak Above Ground Biomass Estimation // Simplifies the
		process of estimating above ground biomass components for teak
		trees using a few basic inputs, based on the equations taken
		from the journal "Allometric equations for estimating above
		ground biomass and leaf area of planted teak (Tectona grandis)
		forests under agroforestry management in East Java, Indonesia"
		(Purwanto  Shiba, 2006) doi:10.60409/forestresearch.76.0_1.
		This function is most reliable when applied to trees from the
		same region where the equations were developed, specifically
		East Java, Indonesia. This function help to estimate the stem
		diameter at the lowest major living branch (DB) using the stem
		diameter at breast height with R^2 = 0.969. Estimate the branch
		dry weight (WB) using the stem diameter at breast height and
		tree height (R^2 = 0.979). Estimate the stem weight (WS) using
		the stem diameter at breast height and tree height (R^2 =
		0.997. Also estimate the leaf dry weight (WL) using the stem
		diameter at the lowest major living branch (R^2 = 0.996).
