		Accesses Brazilian Public Security Data from SINESP Since 2015 //
		Allows access to data from the Brazilian Public Security
		Information System (SINESP) by state and municipality. It
		should be emphasized that the package only extracts the data
		and facilitates its manipulation in R. Therefore, its sole
		purpose is to support empirical research. All data credits
		belong to SINESP, an integrated information platform developed
		and maintained by the National Secretariat of Public Security
		(SENASP) of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security.
