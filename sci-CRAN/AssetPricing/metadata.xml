		Optimal pricing of assets with fixed expiry date. // Calculates
		the optimal price of assets (such as airline flight seats,
		hotel room bookings) whose value becomes zero after a fixed
		``expiry date''.  Assumes potential customers arrive (possibly
		in groups) according to a known inhomogeneous Poisson process.
		Also assumes a known time-varying elasticity of demand (price
		sensitivity) function.  Uses elementary techniques based on
		ordinary differential equations.  Uses the package deSolve to
		effect the solution of these differential equations.
