		"Cereal Headers for R and C++ Serialization" // To facilitate
		using 'cereal' with R via 'cpp11' or 'Rcpp'. 'cereal' is a
		header-only C++11 serialization library. 'cereal' takes
		arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different
		representations, such as compact binary encodings, 'XML', or
		'JSON'. 'cereal' was designed to be fast, light-weight, and
		easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be
		easily bundled with other code or used standalone. Please see
		https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/ for more information.
