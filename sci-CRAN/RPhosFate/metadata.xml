		Soil and Chemical Substance Emission and Transport Model // An
		enhanced version of the semi-empirical, spatially distributed
		emission and transport model PhosFate implemented in 'R' and
		'C++'. It is based on the D-infinity, but also supports the D8
		flow method. The currently available substances are suspended
		solids (SS) and particulate phosphorus (PP). A major feature is
		the allocation of substance loads entering surface waters to
		their sources of origin, which is a basic requirement for the
		identification of critical source areas and in consequence a
		cost-effective implementation of mitigation measures.
