		Add Uncertainty to Data Visualisations // A 'ggplot2' extension
		for visualising uncertainty with the goal of signal
		suppression. Usually, uncertainty visualisation focuses on
		expressing uncertainty as a distribution or probability,
		whereas 'ggdibbler' differentiates itself by viewing an
		uncertainty visualisation as an adjustment to an existing
		graphic that incorporates the inherent uncertainty in the
		estimates.  You provide the code for an existing plot, but
		replace one of the variables with a vector of distributions,
		and it will convert the visualisation into it's signal
		suppression counterpart.
