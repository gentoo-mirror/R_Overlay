		Functions to Study Etiologic Heterogeneity // A collection of
		functions related to the study of etiologic heterogeneity both
		across disease subtypes and across individual tumor markers.
		The included functions allow one to quantify the extent of
		etiologic heterogeneity in the context of a case-control study,
		and provide p-values to test for etiologic heterogeneity across
		individual risk factors.
