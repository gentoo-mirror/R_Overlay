		Creation of Arrays by Mixed Integer Programming // 'CRAN' package
		'DoE.base' and non-'CRAN' packages 'gurobi' and 'Rmosek' (newer
		version than that on 'CRAN') are enhanced with functionality
		for the creation of optimized arrays for experimentation, where
		optimization is in terms of generalized minimum aberration. It
		is also possible to optimally extend existing arrays to larger
		run size. Optimization requires the availability of at least
		one of the commercial products 'Gurobi' or 'Mosek' (free
		academic licenses available for both). For installing 'Gurobi'
		and its R package 'gurobi', follow instructions at
		http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer and http://www
		.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/refman/r_api_overview.html. For
		installing 'Mosek' and its R package 'Rmosek', follow
		instructions at https://www.mosek.com/downloads/ and
		http://docs.mosek.com/8.1/rmosek/install-interface.html.
