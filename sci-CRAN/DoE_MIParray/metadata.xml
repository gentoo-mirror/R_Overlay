		Creation of Arrays by Mixed Integer Programming // 'CRAN'
		packages 'DoE.base' and 'Rmosek' and non-'CRAN' package
		'gurobi' are enhanced with functionality for the creation of
		optimized arrays for experimentation, where optimization is in
		terms of generalized minimum aberration. It is also possible to
		optimally extend existing arrays to larger run size. The
		package writes 'MPS' (Mathematical Programming System) files
		for use with any mixed integer optimization software that can
		process such files. If at least one of the commercial products
		'Gurobi' or 'Mosek' (free academic licenses available for both)
		is available, the package also creates arrays by optimization.
		For installing 'Gurobi' and its R package 'gurobi', follow
		instructions at https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-
		optimizer/ and https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/refman/
		r_api_overview.html (or higher version). For installing 'Mosek'
		and its R package 'Rmosek', follow instructions at
		https://www.mosek.com/downloads/ and
		https://docs.mosek.com/8.1/rmosek/install-interface.html, or
		use the functionality in the stump CRAN R package 'Rmosek'.
