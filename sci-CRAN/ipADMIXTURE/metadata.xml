		Iterative Pruning Population Admixture Inference Framework // A
		data clustering package based on admixture ratios (Q matrix) of
		population structure. The framework is based on iterative
		Pruning procedure that performs data clustering by splitting a
		given population into subclusters until meeting the condition
		of stopping criteria the same as ipPCA, iNJclust, and IPCAPS
		frameworks. The package also provides a function to retrieve
		phylogeny tree that construct a neighbor-joining tree based on
		a similar matrix between clusters. By given multiple Q matrices
		with varying a number of ancestors (K), the framework define a
		similar value between clusters i,j as a minimum number K* that
		makes majority of members of two clusters are in the different
		clusters. This K* reflexes a minimum number of ancestors we
		need to splitting cluster i,j into different clusters if we
		assign K* clusters based on maximum admixture ratio of
		individuals. The publication of this package is at Chainarong
		Amornbunchornvej, Pongsakorn Wangkumhang, and Sissades Tongsima
