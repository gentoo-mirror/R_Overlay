		Vegetation Phenological Cycle and Anomaly Detection using Remote
		Sensing Data // Calculates phenological cycle and anomalies
		using a non-parametric approach applied to time series of
		vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data or field
		measurements. The package implements basic and high-level
		functions for manipulating vector data (numerical series) and
		raster data (satellite derived products). Processing of very
		large raster files is supported. For more information, please
		check the following paper: Chvez et al. (2023)
		doi:10.3390/rs15010073.
