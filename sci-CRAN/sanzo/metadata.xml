		Color Palettes Based on the Works of Sanzo Wada // Inspired by
		the art and color research of Sanzo Wada (1883-1967), his
		"Dictionary Of Color Combinations" (2011, ISBN:978-4861522475),
		and the interactive site by Dain M. Blodorn Kim
		https://github.com/dblodorn/sanzo-wada, this package brings
		Wada's color combinations to R for easy use in data
		visualizations. This package honors 60 of Wada's color
		combinations: 20 duos, 20 trios, and 20 quads.
