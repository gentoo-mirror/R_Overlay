		Statistical Analysis and Programming // The Hypothesis tests for
		the means of independent or paired groups. This package
		investigates the normality assumption automatically. Then, it
		tests the hypothesis tests for two independent or paired group
		means by using parametric or non-parametric tests. It uses the
		Shapiro-Wilk test to test the normality assumption. For
		independent two groups, If data comes from the normal
		distribution, the package uses the Z or t-test according to
		whether variances are known. For paired groups, it uses paired
		t-test under normal data sets. If data does not come from the
		normal distribution, the package uses the Wilcoxon test for
		independent and paired cases.
