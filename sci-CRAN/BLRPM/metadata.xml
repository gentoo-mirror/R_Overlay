		Stochastic Rainfall Generator Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulse
		Model // Due to a limited availability of observed high-
		resolution precipitation records with adequate length,
		simulations with stochastic precipitation models are used to
		generate series for subsequent studies [e.g. Khaliq and Cunmae,
		1996, doi:10.1016/0022-1694(95)02894-3, Vandenberghe et al.,
		2011, doi:10.1029/2009WR008388]. This package contains an R
		implementation of the original Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse
		model (BLRPM), developed by Rodriguez-Iturbe et al. (1987)
		doi:10.1098/rspa.1987.0039. It contains a function for
		simulating a precipitation time series based on storms and
		cells generated by the model with given or estimated model
		parameters. Additionally BLRPM parameters can be estimated from
		a given or simulated precipitation time series. The model
		simulations can be plotted in a three-layer plot including an
		overview of generated storms and cells by the model (which can
		also be plotted individually), a continuous step-function and a
		discrete precipitation time series at a chosen aggregation
		level.
