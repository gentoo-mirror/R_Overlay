		Penalized Cox Model for High-Dimensional Data with Grouped
		Predictors // Fit the penalized Cox models with both non-
		overlapping and overlapping grouped penalties including the
		group lasso, group smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD),
		and group minimax concave penalty (MCP). The algorithms combine
		the Majorization Minimization (MM) approach and group-wise
		descent with some computational tricks including the screening,
		active set, and warm-start. Different tuning regularization
		parameter methods are provided.
