		Integration of Functions Over Simplices // Provides methods to
		integrate functions over m-dimensional simplices in
		n-dimensional Euclidean space.  There are exact methods for
		polynomials and adaptive methods for integrating an arbitrary
		function.  Dirichlet probabilities are calculated in certain
		cases.
