		Fast Generators and Iterators for Permutations, Combinations and
		Partitions // Fast generators and iterators for permutations,
		combinations and partitions. The iterators allow users to
		generate arrangements in a memory efficient manner and the
		generated arrangements are in lexicographical (dictionary)
		order. Permutations and combinations can be drawn with/without
		replacement and support multisets. It has been demonstrated
		that 'arrangements' outperforms most of the existing packages
		of similar kind. Some benchmarks could be found at
		https://randy3k.github.io/arrangements/articles/benchmark.html.
