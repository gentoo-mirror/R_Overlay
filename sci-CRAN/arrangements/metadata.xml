		Fast Generators and Iterators for Permutations, Combinations,
		Integer Partitions and Compositions // Fast generators and
		iterators for permutations, combinations, integer partitions
		and compositions. The arrangements are in lexicographical order
		and generated iteratively in a memory efficient manner. It has
		been demonstrated that 'arrangements' outperforms most existing
		packages of similar kind. Benchmarks could be found at
		https://randy3k.github.io/arrangements/articles/benchmark.html.
