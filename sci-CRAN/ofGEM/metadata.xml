		A Meta-Analysis Approach with Filtering for Identifying Gene-
		Level Gene-Environment Interactions with Genetic Association
		Data // Offers a gene-based meta-analysis test with filtering
		to detect gene-environment interactions (GxE) with association
		data, proposed by Wang et al. (2018) doi:10.1002/gepi.22115. It
		first conducts a meta-filtering test to filter out unpromising
		SNPs by combining all samples in the consortia data. It then
		runs a test of omnibus-filtering-based GxE meta-analysis
		(ofGEM) that combines the strengths of the fixed- and random-
		effects meta-analysis with meta-filtering. It can also analyze
		data from multiple ethnic groups.
