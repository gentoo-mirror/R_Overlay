		Prediction Model Selection and Performance Evaluation in Multiple
		Imputed Datasets // Pooling, backward and forward selection of
		logistic and Cox regression models in multiply imputed
		datasets. Backward and forward selection can be done from the
		pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the D1, D2, D3 and the
		median p-values method. This is also possible for Mixed models.
		The models can contain continuous, dichotomous, categorical and
		restricted cubic spline predictors and interaction terms
		between    all these type of predictors. The stability of the
		models       can be evaluated using bootstrapping and cluster
		bootstrapping. The package further contains functions to pool
		the model performance as ROC/AUC, R-squares, scaled Brier score
		and calibration  plots for logistic regression models. Internal
		validation can be        done with cross-validation or
		bootstrapping. The adjusted intercept after shrinkage of pooled
		regression coefficients can be obtained. Backward and forward
		selection as part of internal validation is possible. A
		function to externally validate logistic prediction models in
		multiple imputed datasets is available and a function to
		compare models. Eekhout (2017) doi:10.1186/s12874-017-0404-7.
