		Prediction Model Selection and Performance Evaluation in Multiple
		Imputed Datasets // Provides functions to apply pooling or
		backward selection for logistic or Cox regression prediction
		models in multiple imputed datasets. Backward selection can be
		done from the pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the total
		covariance matrix (D1 method), pooling chi-square values (D2
		method), pooling likelihood ratio statistics (D3) or pooling
		the median p-values. The model can contain continuous,
		dichotomous, categorical predictors and interaction terms
		between all  type of these predictors. Continuous predictors
		can also be introduced as restricted cubic spline coefficients.
		It is also possible to force (spline) predictors or interaction
		terms in the model during predictor selection. The package also
		contains functions to generate apparent model performance
		measures over imputed datasets as ROC/AUC, R-squares, fit test
		values and calibration plots. A wrapper function       over
		Frank Harrell's validate function is used for that. Bootstrap
		internal validation is performed in each imputed dataset and
		results are pooled. Backward selection as part of internal
		validation is optional and recommended. Also a function to
		externally validate logistic prediction models in multiple
		imputed datasets is available. Eekhout (2017)
