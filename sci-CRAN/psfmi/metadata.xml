		Prediction Model Selection and Performance Evaluation in Multiple
		Imputed Datasets // Provides functions to apply pooling or
		backward selection of logistic, Cox regression and Multilevel
		(mixed models) prediction models in multiply imputed datasets.
		Backward selection can be done from the pooled model using
		Rubin's Rules (RR), the D1, D2, D3 and promising median
		p-values method. The model can contain continuous, dichotomous,
		categorical predictors and interaction terms between all
		these type of predictors. Continuous predictors can also be
		introduced as restricted cubic spline coefficients. It is also
		possible to force (spline) predictors or interaction terms in
		the model during predictor selection. The package includes a
		function to evaluate the stability of the models  using
		bootstrapping and cluster bootstrapping. The package further
		contains functions to generate pooled model performance
		measures in multiply imputed datasets as ROC/AUC, R-squares,
		Brier score, fit test values and calibration    plots for
		logistic regression models. A function to apply Bootstrap
		internal validation is also available where two methods can be
		used to combine bootstrapping and    multiple imputation. One
		method, boot_MI, first draws   bootstrap samples and
		subsequently performs multiple imputation and with the other
		method, MI_boot, first bootstrap samples are drawn from each
		imputed dataset before results are combined. The adjusted
		intercept after shrinkage of the pooled regression coefficients
		can be subsequently obtained. Backward selection as part of
		internal validation is also an option. Also a function to
		externally validate logistic  prediction models in multiple
		imputed datasets is available. Eekhout (2017)
