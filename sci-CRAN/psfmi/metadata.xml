		Prediction Model Pooling, Selection and Performance Evaluation
		Across Multiply Imputed Datasets // Pooling, backward and
		forward selection of linear, logistic and Cox regression models
		in multiply imputed datasets. Backward and forward selection
		can be done from the pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the
		D1, D2, D3, D4 and the median p-values method. This is also
		possible for Mixed models. The models can contain continuous,
		dichotomous, categorical and restricted cubic spline predictors
		and interaction terms between   all these type of predictors.
		The stability of the models       can be evaluated using
		(cluster) bootstrapping. The package further contains functions
		to pool model performance measures as ROC/AUC,
		Reclassification, R-squared, scaled Brier score, HL test and
		calibration  plots for logistic regression models. Internal
		validation can be done across multiply imputed datasets with
		cross-validation or bootstrapping. The adjusted intercept after
		shrinkage of pooled regression coefficients can be obtained.
		Backward and forward selection as part of internal validation
		is possible. A function to externally validate logistic
		prediction models in multiple imputed datasets is available and
		a function to compare models. For Cox models a strata variable
		can be included. Eekhout (2017) doi:10.1186/s12874-017-0404-7.
