		Heterogeneous Effects Analysis of Conjoint Experiments // A tool
		for analyzing conjoint experiments using Bayesian Additive
		Regression Trees ('BART'), a machine learning method developed
		by Chipman, George and McCulloch (2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285.
		This tool focuses specifically on estimating, identifying, and
		visualizing the heterogeneity within marginal component
		effects, at the observation- and individual-level. It uses a
		variable importance measure ('VIMP') with delete-d jackknife
		variance estimation, following Ishwaran and Lu (2019)
		doi:10.1002/sim.7803, to obtain bias-corrected estimates of
		which variables drive heterogeneity in the predicted
		individual-level effects.
