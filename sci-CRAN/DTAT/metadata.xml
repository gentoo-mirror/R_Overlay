		Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning // DTAT is a methodologic
		framework allowing dose individualization to be conceived as a
		continuous learning process that begins in early-phase clinical
		trials and continues throughout drug development, on into
		clinical practice. This package includes code that researchers
		may use to reproduce or extend key results of the DTAT research
		programme, plus tools for trialists to design and simulate a
		'3+3/PC' dose-finding study. Please see Norris (2017)
