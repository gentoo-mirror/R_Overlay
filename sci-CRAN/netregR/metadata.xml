		Regression of Network Responses // Regress network responses
		(both directed and undirected) onto covariates of interest that
		may be actor-, relation-, or network-valued. In addition,
		compute principled variance estimates of the coefficients
		assuming that the errors are jointly exchangeable. Missing data
		is accommodated. Additionally implements building and inversion
		of covariance matrices under joint exchangeability, and
		generates random covariance matrices of this class. For more
		detail on methods, see Marrs (2017) arXiv:1701.05530.
