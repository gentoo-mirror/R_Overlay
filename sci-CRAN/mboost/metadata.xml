		Model-Based Boosting // Functional gradient descent algorithm
		(boosting) for optimizing general risk functions utilizing
		component-wise (penalised) least squares estimates or
		regression trees as base-learners for fitting generalized
		linear, additive and interaction models to potentially high-
		dimensional data. Models and algorithms are described in
		\doi{10.1214/07-STS242}, a hands-on tutorial is available from
		\doi{10.1007/s00180-012-0382-5}. The package allows user-
		specified loss functions and base-learners.
