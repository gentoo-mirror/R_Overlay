		Adaptive Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Hybrid Genetic
		Optimization // The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a type of
		optimization method of Evolutionary Algorithms. It uses the
		biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover,
		selection and replacement.Because of their global search and
		robustness abilities, GAs have been widely utilized in machine
		learning, expert systems, data science, engineering, life
		sciences and many other areas of research and business.
		However, the regular GAs need the techniques to improve their
		efficiency in computing time and performance in finding global
		optimum using some adaptation and hybridization strategies. The
		adaptive GAs (AGA) increase the convergence speed and success
		of regular GAs by setting the parameters crossover and mutation
		probabilities dynamically. The hybrid GAs combine the
		exploration strength of a stochastic GAs with the exact
		convergence ability of any type of deterministic local search
		algorithms such as simulated-annealing, in addition to other
		nature-inspired algorithms such as ant colony optimization,
		particle swarm optimization etc. The package 'adana' includes a
		rich working environment with its many functions that make
		possible to build and work regular GA, adaptive GA, hybrid GA
		and hybrid adaptive GA for any kind of optimization problems.
