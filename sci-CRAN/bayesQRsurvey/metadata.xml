		Bayesian Quantile Regression Models for Complex Survey Data
		Analysis // Provides Bayesian quantile regression models for
		complex survey data under informative sampling using survey-
		weighted estimators. Both single- and multiple-output models
		are supported. To accelerate computation, all algorithms are
		implemented in 'C++' using 'Rcpp', 'RcppArmadillo', and
		'RcppEigen', and are called from 'R'. See Nascimento and
		Gonalves (2024) doi:10.1093/jssam/smae015 and Nascimento and
		Gonalves (2025, in press) https://academic.oup.com/jssam.
