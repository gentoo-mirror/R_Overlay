		Derivation of Regression-Based Normative Data // Normative data
		are often used to estimate the relative position of a raw test
		score in the population. This package allows for deriving
		regression-based normative data. It includes functions that
		enable the fitting of regression models for the mean and
		residual (or variance) structures, test the model assumptions,
		derive the normative data in the form of normative tables or
		automatic scoring sheets, and estimate confidence intervals for
		the norms. This package accompanies the book Van der Elst, W.
		(2024). Regression-based normative data for psychological
		assessment. A hands-on approach using R. Springer Nature.
