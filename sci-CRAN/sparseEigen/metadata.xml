		Computation of Sparse Eigenvectors of a Matrix // Computation of
		sparse eigenvectors of a matrix (aka sparse PCA) with running
		time 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than existing methods and
		better final performance in terms of recovery of sparsity
		pattern and estimation of numerical values. Can handle
		covariance matrices as well as data matrices with real or
		complex-valued entries. Different levels of sparsity can be
		specified for each individual ordered eigenvector and the
		method is robust in parameter selection. See vignette for a
		detailed documentation and comparison, with several
		illustrative examples. The package is based on the paper: K.
		Benidis, Y. Sun, P. Babu, and D. P. Palomar (2016). "Orthogonal
		Sparse PCA and Covariance Estimation via Procrustes
		Reformulation," IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
		doi:10.1109/TSP.2016.2605073.
