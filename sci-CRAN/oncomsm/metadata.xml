		Bayesian Multi-State Models for Early Oncology // Implements
		methods to fit a parametric Bayesian multi-state model to tumor
		response data. The model can be used to sample from the
		predictive distribution to impute missing data and calculate
		probability of success for custom decision criteria in early
		clinical trials during an ongoing trial. The inference is
		implemented using 'stan'.
