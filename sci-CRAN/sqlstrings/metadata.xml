		Map 'SQL' Code to R Lists // Provides a helper function, to bulk
		read 'SQL' code from separate files and load it into an 'R'
		list, where the list elements contain the individual statements
		and queries as strings. This works by annotating the 'SQL' code
		with a name comment, which also will be the name of the list
		element.
