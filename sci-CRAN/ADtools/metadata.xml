		Automatic Differentiation Toolbox // Implements the forward-mode
		automatic differentiation for multivariate functions using the
		matrix-calculus notation from Magnus and Neudecker (2019)
		doi:10.1002/9781119541219. Two key features of the package are:
		(i) it incorporates various optimisation strategies to improve
		performance; this includes applying memoisation to cut down
		object construction time, using sparse matrix representation to
		speed up derivative calculation, and creating specialised
		matrix operations to reduce computation time; (ii) it supports
		differentiating random variates with respect to their
		parameters, targeting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
		general simulation-based applications.
