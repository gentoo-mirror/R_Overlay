		Utilities for Making and Plotting Mazes // Functionality for
		generating and plotting random mazes. The mazes are based on
		matrices, so can only consist of vertical and horizontal lines
		along a regular grid. But there is no need to use every
		possible space, so they can take on many different shapes.
