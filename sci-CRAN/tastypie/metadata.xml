		Easy Pie Charts // You only need to type 'why pie charts are bad'
		on Google to find thousands of articles full of (valid) reasons
		why other types of charts should be preferred over this one.
		Therefore, because of the little use due to the reasons already
		mentioned, making pie charts (and related) in R is not
		straightforward, so other functions are needed to simplify
		things. In this R package there are useful functions to make
		'tasty' pie charts immediately by exploiting the many cool
		templates provided.
