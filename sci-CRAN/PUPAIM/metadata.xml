		'A Collection of Physical and Chemical Adsorption Isotherm
		Models' // Adsorption isotherm equations are linearized plots
		of different solid-liquid phase equilibria used in calculating
		different parameters related to the adsorption process.
		Isotherm equations deals with physical adsorption of gases and
		vapor and gives the most important characteristics  of
		industrial adsorbents that include pore volume, pore size or
		energy distribution. PUPAIM has 28 documented adsorption
		isotherm models listed by Dabrowski (2001)
		doi:10.1016/S0001-8686(00)00082-8 and Ayawei et al.(2017)
		doi:10.1155/2017/3039817. These models could be easily  fitted
		in R using adsorption data (Ce and Qe) obtained from
		experiments.
