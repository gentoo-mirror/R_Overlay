		Penalized Ordinal Regression // Fits ordinal regression models
		with elastic net penalty. Supported model families include
		cumulative probability, stopping ratio, continuation ratio, and
		adjacent category. These families are a subset of vector glm's
		which belong to a model class we call the elementwise link
		multinomial-ordinal (ELMO) class. Each family in this class
		links a vector of covariates to a vector of class
		probabilities. Each of these families has a parallel form,
		which is appropriate for ordinal response data, as well as a
		nonparallel form that is appropriate for an unordered
		categorical response, or as a more flexible model for ordinal
		data. The parallel model has a single set of coefficients,
		whereas the nonparallel model has a set of coefficients for
		each response category except the baseline category. It is also
		possible to fit a model with both parallel and nonparallel
		terms, which we call the semi-parallel model. The semi-parallel
		model has the flexibility of the nonparallel model, but the
		elastic net penalty shrinks it toward the parallel model. For
		details, refer to Wurm, Hanlon, and Rathouz (2021)
