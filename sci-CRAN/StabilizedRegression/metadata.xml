		Stabilizing Regression and Variable Selection // Contains an
		implementation of 'StabilizedRegression', a regression
		framework for heterogeneous data introduced in Pfister et al.
		(2019) arXiv:1911.01850. The procedure uses averaging to
		estimate a regression of a set of predictors X on a response
		variable Y by enforcing stability with respect to a given
		environment variable. The resulting regression leads to a
		variable selection procedure which allows to distinguish
		between stable and unstable predictors. The package further
		implements a visualization technique which illustrates the
		trade-off between stability and predictiveness of individual
		predictors.
