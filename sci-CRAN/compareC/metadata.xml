		Compare Two Correlated C Indices with Right-Censored Survival
		Outcome // Proposed by Harrell, the C index or concordance C,
		is considered an overall measure of discrimination in survival
		analysis between a survival outcome that is possibly right
		censored and a predictive-score variable, which can represent a
		measured biomarker or a composite-score output from an
		algorithm that combines multiple biomarkers. This package aims
		to statistically compare two C indices with right-censored
		survival outcome, which commonly arise from a paired design and
		thus resulting two correlated C indices.
