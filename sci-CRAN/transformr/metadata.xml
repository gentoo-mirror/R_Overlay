		Polygon and Path Transformations // In order to smoothly animate
		the transformation of polygons and paths, many aspects needs to
		be taken into account, such as differing number of control
		points, changing center of rotation, etc. The 'transformr'
		package provides an extensive framework for manipulating the
		shapes of polygons and paths and can be seen as the spatial
		brother to the 'tweenr' package.
