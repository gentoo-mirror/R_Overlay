		Sparse Vectors for Use in Data Frames // Provides sparse vectors
		powered by ALTREP (Alternative Representations for R Objects)
		that behave like regular vectors, and can thus be used in data
		frames. Also provides tools to convert between sparse matrices
		and data frames with sparse columns and functions to interact
		with sparse vectors.
