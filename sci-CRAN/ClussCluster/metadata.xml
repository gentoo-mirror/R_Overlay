		Simultaneous Detection of Clusters and Cluster-Specific Genes in
		High-Throughput Transcriptome Data // Implements a new method
		'ClussCluster' descried in Ge Jiang and Jun Li, "Simultaneous
		Detection of Clusters and Cluster-Specific Genes in High-
		throughput Transcriptome Data" (Unpublished). Simultaneously
		perform clustering analysis and signature    gene selection on
		high-dimensional transcriptome data sets.     To do so,
		'ClussCluster' incorporates a Lasso-type      regularization
		penalty term to the objective function of K-     means so that
		cell-type-specific signature genes can be         identified
		while clustering the cells.
