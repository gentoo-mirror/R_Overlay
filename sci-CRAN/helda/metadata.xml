		Preprocess Data and Get Better Insights from Machine Learning
		Models // The main focus is on preprocessing and data
		visualization of machine learning models performances. Some
		functions allow to fill in gaps in time series using linear
		interpolation on panel data, some functions permit to draw lift
		effect and lift curve in order to benchmark machine learning
		models or you can even find the optimal number of clusters in
		agglomerative clustering algorithm.
