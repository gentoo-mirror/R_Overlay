		Define and Enforce Contracts for Dataframes as Function
		Parameters // A dataframe validation framework for package
		builders who use dataframes as function parameters. It performs
		checks on column names, coerces data-types, and checks grouping
		to make sure user inputs conform to a specification provided by
		the package author. It provides a mechanism for package authors
		to automatically document supported dataframe inputs and
		selectively dispatch to functions depending on the format of a
		dataframe much like S3 does for classes. It also contains some
		developer tools to make working with and documenting dataframe
		specifications easier. It helps package developers to improve
		their documentation and simplifies parameter validation where
		dataframes are used as function parameters.
