		Similarity Regression // Similarity regression, evaluating the
		probability of association between sets of ontological terms
		and binary response vector. A no-association model is compared
		with one in which the log odds of a true response is linked to
		the semantic similarity between terms and a latent
		characteristic ontological profile - 'Phenotype Similarity
		Regression for Identifying the Genetic Determinants of Rare
		Diseases', Greene et al 2016 doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.01.008.
