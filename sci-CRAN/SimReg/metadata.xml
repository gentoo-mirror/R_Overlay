		Similarity Regression // Functions for performing Bayesian
		similarity regression, and evaluating the probability of
		association between sets of ontological terms and binary
		response vector. A random model is compared with one in which
		the log odds of a true response is linked to the semantic
		similarity between terms and a latent characteristic
		ontological profile.
