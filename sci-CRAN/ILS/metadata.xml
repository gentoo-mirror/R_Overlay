		Interlaboratory Study // It performs interlaboratory studies
		(ILS) to detect those laboratories that provide non-consistent
		results when comparing to others. It permits to work
		simultaneously with various testing materials, from standard
		univariate, and functional data analysis (FDA) perspectives.
		The univariate approach based on ASTM E691-08 consist of
		estimating the Mandel's h and k statistics to identify those
		laboratories that provide more significant different results,
		testing also the presence of outliers by Cochran and Grubbs
		tests, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques are provided (F
		and Tuckey tests) to test differences in means corresponding to
		different laboratories per each material. Taking into account
		the functional nature of data retrieved in analytical
		chemistry, applied physics and engineering (spectra,
		thermograms, etc.). ILS package provides a FDA approach for
		finding the Mandel's k and h statistics distribution by
		smoothing bootstrap resampling.
