		Render Sequence Plots using 'ggplot2' // A set of wrapper
		functions that mainly re-produces some of the sequence plots
		rendered with TraMineR::seqplot() and 'TraMineRextras'. Whereas
		'TraMineR' uses base R to produce the plots this library draws
		on 'ggplot2'. The plots are produced on the basis of a sequence
		object defined with TraMineR::seqdef(). The package automates
		the reshaping and plotting of sequence data. Resulting plots
		are of class 'ggplot', i.e. components can be added and tweaked
		using '+' and regular 'ggplot2' functions.
