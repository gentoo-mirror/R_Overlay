		An Ensemble Method for Combining Subset-Specific Algorithm Fits
		// The Subsemble algorithm is a general subset ensemble
		prediction method, which can be used for small, moderate, or
		large datasets. Subsemble partitions the full dataset into
		subsets of observations, fits a specified underlying algorithm
		on each subset, and uses a unique form of k-fold cross-
		validation to output a prediction function that combines the
		subset-specific fits. An oracle result provides a theoretical
		performance guarantee for Subsemble. The paper, "Subsemble: An
		ensemble method for combining subset-specific algorithm fits"
		is authored by Stephanie Sapp, Mark J. van der Laan  John Canny
		(2014) doi:10.1080/02664763.2013.864263.
