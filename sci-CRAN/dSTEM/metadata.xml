		Multiple Testing of Local Extrema for Detection of Change Points
		// Simultaneously detect the number and locations of change
		points in piecewise linear models under stationary Gaussian
		noise allowing autocorrelated random noise. The core idea is to
		transform the problem of detecting change points into the
		detection of local extrema (local maxima and local
		minima)through kernel smoothing and differentiation of the data
		sequence, see Cheng et al. (2020) doi:10.1214/20-EJS1751. A
		low-computational and fast algorithm call 'dSTEM' is introduced
		to detect change points based on the 'STEM' algorithm in D.
