		Dimension Reduction, Regression and Discrimination for
		Chemometrics // Data exploration and prediction with focus on
		high dimensional data and chemometrics. The package was
		initially designed about partial least squares regression and
		discrimination models and variants, in particular locally
		weighted PLS models (LWPLS). Then, it has been expanded to many
		other methods for analyzing high dimensional data. The name
		'rchemo' comes from the fact that the package is orientated to
		chemometrics, but most of the provided methods are fully
		generic to other domains. Functions such as transform(),
		predict(), coef() and summary() are available. Tuning the
		predictive models is facilitated by generic functions
		gridscore() (validation dataset) and gridcv() (cross-
		validation). Faster versions are also available for models
		based on latent variables (LVs) (gridscorelv() and gridcvlv())
		and ridge regularization (gridscorelb() and gridcvlb()).
