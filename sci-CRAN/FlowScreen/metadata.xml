		Daily Streamflow Trend and Change Point Screening // Screens
		daily streamflow time series for temporal trends and change-
		points. This package has been primarily developed for assessing
		the quality of daily streamflow time series. It also contains
		tools for plotting and calculating many different streamflow
		metrics. The package can be used to produce summary screening
		plots showing change-points and significant temporal trends for
		high flow, low flow, and/or baseflow statistics, or it can be
		used to perform more detailed hydrological time series
		analyses. The package was designed for screening daily
		streamflow time series from Water Survey Canada and the United
		States Geological Survey but will also work with streamflow
		time series from many other agencies. Package update to version
		2.0 made updates to read.flows function to allow loading of
		GRDC and ROBIN streamflow record formats. This package uses the
		`changepoint` package for change point detection. For more
		information on change point methods, see the changepoint
		package at https://cran.r-project.org/package=changepoint.
