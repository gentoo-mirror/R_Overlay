		Estimating Conditional Distributions // Estimates conditional
		distributions and conditional quantiles.  The versions of the
		methods in this package are primarily for use in multiple step
		procedures where the first step is to estimate a conditional
		distribution.  In particular, there are functions for
		implementing distribution regression, quantile regression, and
		versions of local linear distribution regression; all in a
		unified framework.  Distribution regression provides a way to
		flexibly model the distribution of some outcome Y conditional
		on covariates X without imposing parametric assumptions on the
		conditional distribution but providing more structure than
		fully nonparametric estimation (See Foresi and Peracchi (1995)
		doi:10.2307/2291056 and Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Melly
		(2013) doi:10.3982/ECTA10582).
