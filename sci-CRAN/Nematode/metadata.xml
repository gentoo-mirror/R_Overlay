		Ecological Indices Calculator for Nematode Communities //
		Provides a computational toolkit for analyzing nematode
		communities in ecological studies. Includes methods to quantify
		nematode-based ecological indicators such as metabolic
		footprints, energy flow metrics, and community structure. These
		tools support assessments of soil health, ecosystem
		functioning, and trophic interactions, standardizing the use of
		nematodes as bioindicators.
