		Ecological Indices Calculator for Nematode Communities //
		Nematode communities serve as crucial bioindicators in
		ecological studies, reflecting soil health, ecosystem
		functioning, and trophic interactions. To standardize these
		assessments, we developed a computational toolkit for
		quantifying nematode-based ecological indicators, including
		metabolic footprints, energy flow metrics, and community
		structure analysis.
