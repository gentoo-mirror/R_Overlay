		Launch a Shiny Application without Opening R or RStudio // Launch
		an application by a simple click without opening R or RStudio.
		The package has 3 functions of which only one is essential in
		its use, `shiny.exe()`. It generates a script in the open shiny
		project then create a shortcut in the same folder that allows
		you to launch the app by clicking.If you set `host = 'public'`,
		the application will be launched on the public server to which
		you are connected. Thus, all other devices connected to the
		same server will be able to access the application through the
		link of your `IPv4` extended by the port. You can stop the
		application by leaving the terminal opened by the shortcut.
