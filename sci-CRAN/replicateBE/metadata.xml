		Average Bioequivalence with Expanding Limits (ABEL) // Performs
		comparative bioavailability-calculations for the EMA's Average
		Bioequivalence with Expanding Limits (ABEL). Implemented are
		'Method A' and 'Method B', detection of outliers. If the design
		allows, assessment of the empiric Type I Error and iteratively
		adjusting alpha to preserve the consumer risk. Average
		Bioequivalence (ABE) - optionally with tighter (EMA: NTIDs) or
		wider limits (GCC: Cmax) - is implemented as well.
