		Average Bioequivalence with Expanding Limits (ABEL) // Performs
		comparative bioavailability calculations for Average
		Bioequivalence with Expanding Limits (ABEL). Implemented are
		'Method A' / 'Method B' and the detection of outliers. If the
		design allows, assessment of the empiric Type I Error and
		iteratively adjusting alpha to control the consumer risk.
		Average Bioequivalence - optionally with a tighter (narrow
		therapeutic index drugs) or wider acceptance range (South
		Africa: Cmax) - is implemented as well.
