		Tools for Script Editing // A collection of useful tools for
		programming and writing-scripts. Several functions are simple
		wrappers around base R functions that extend their
		functionality while also providing some convenient
		propertiesregular expression functions that automatically
		detect look-ahead and look-behind statements, a read-line
		function that suppresses incomplete-final-line warnings and
		automatically opens and closes connections, a version of
		substrings that starts from the end of strings, etc. Other
		functions are useful for working with hexadecimal colors,
		installing packages, omitting missing data, and showing in-use
		connections.
