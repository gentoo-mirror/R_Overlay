		Seasonality Variation Plots of Stock Prices and Cryptocurrencies
		// The price action at any given time is determined by investor
		sentiment and market conditions. Although there is no
		established principle, over a long period of time, things often
		move with a certain periodicity. This is sometimes referred to
		as anomaly. The seasonPlot() function in this package
		calculates and visualizes the average value of price movements
		over a year for any given period. In addition, the monthly
		increase or decrease in price movement is represented with a
		colored background. This seasonPlot() function can use the same
		symbols as the 'quantmod' package (e.g. ^IXIC, ^DJI, SPY, BTC-
		USD, and ETH-USD etc).
