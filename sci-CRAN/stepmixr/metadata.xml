		Interface to 'Python' Package 'StepMix' // This is an interface
		for the 'Python' package 'StepMix'. It is a 'Python' package
		following the scikit-learn API for model-based clustering and
		generalized mixture modeling (latent class/profile analysis) of
		continuous and categorical data. 'StepMix' handles missing
		values through Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) and
		provides multiple stepwise Expectation-Maximization (EM)
		estimation methods based on pseudolikelihood theory. Additional
		features include support for covariates and distal outcomes,
		various simulation utilities, and non-parametric bootstrapping,
		which allows inference in semi-supervised and unsupervised
		settings.
