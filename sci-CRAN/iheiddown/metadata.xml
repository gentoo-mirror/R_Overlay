		For Writing Geneva Graduate Institute Documents // A set of tools
		for writing documents according to Geneva Graduate Institute
		conventions and regulations. The most common use is for writing
		and compiling theses or thesis chapters, as drafts or for
		examination with correct preamble formatting. However, the
		package also offers users to create HTML presentation slides
		with 'xaringan', complete problem sets, format posters, and,
		for course instructors, prepare a syllabus. The package
		includes additional functions for institutional color palettes,
		an institutional 'ggplot' theme, a function for counting
		manuscript words, and a bibliographical analysis toolkit.
