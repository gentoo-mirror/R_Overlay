		For Writing Graduate Institute Geneva Documents // A set of tools
		to support writing various documents according to the Graduate
		Institute of International and Development Studies conventions
		and regulations. The most common use will be for writing and
		compiling theses or thesis chapters, as drafts or for
		examination with all the correct preamble content. However, the
		package also offers the creation of html presentation slides
		via 'xaringan', the capacity to write problem sets and, for
		course instructors, the ability to create syllabi. The package
		includes additional functions for institutional color palettes
		and an institutional 'ggplot' theme, as well as a function for
		word counts and a bibliographical analysis toolkit.
