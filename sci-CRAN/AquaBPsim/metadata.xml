		Aquaculture Breeding Program Simulation // Breeding programs can
		be simulated with this package. The functions are written to
		simulate production and reproduction systems encountered in
		aquaculture and are easy to combine with custom functions.
		Simulating breeding programs is useful to predict the expected
		genetic gain, rate of inbreeding and the effect of changes in
		the breeding program. AquaBPsim does not simulate genome wide-
		markers and QTLs, but it simulates estimated breeding values as
		values correlated to the true breeding values. The correlation
		equals the accuracy, which can be provided or calculated using
		deterministic formulas. For genomic selection, the accuracy can
		be calculate using the formula of Deatwyler et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1534/genetics.110.116855. Without genomic selection,
		accuracy can be calculated with the selection index method
		(Mrode, 2014. ISBN:978-1-84593-981-6).
