		A Nonparametric Trend Test for Independent and Dependent Samples
		// Implements the nonparametric trend test for one or several
		samples as proposed by Bathke (2009)
		doi:10.1007/s00184-008-0171-x. The method provides a unified
		framework for analyzing trends in both independent and
		dependent data samples, making it a versatile tool for various
		study designs. The package allows for the evaluation of
		different trend alternatives, including two-sided (general
		trend), monotonic increasing, and monotonic decreasing trends.
		As a nonparametric procedure, it does not require the
		assumption of data normality, offering a robust alternative to
		parametric tests.
