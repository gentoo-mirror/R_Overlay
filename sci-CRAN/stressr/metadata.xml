		Fetch and plot financial stress index and component data. //
		Forms queries to submit to the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank
		web site's financial stress index data site.  Provides query
		functions for both the composite stress index and the
		components data. By default the download includes daily time
		series data starting September 25, 1991.  The functions return
		a class of either type easing or cfsi which contain a list of
		items related to the query and its graphical presentation.  The
		list includes the time series data as an xts object.  The
		package provides four lattice time series plots to render the
		time series data in a manner similar to the bank's own
		presentation.
