		Run and Predict a Fuzzy DBScan // An interface for training Fuzzy
		DBScan with both Fuzzy Core and Fuzzy Border. Therefore, the
		package provides a method to initialize and run the algorithm
		and a function to predict new data w.t.h. of 'R6'. The package
		is build upon the paper "Fuzzy Extensions of the DBScan
		algorithm" from Ienco and Bordogna (2018)
		doi:10.1007/s00500-016-2435-0. A predict function assigns new
		data according to the same criteria as the algorithm itself.
		However, the prediction function freezes the algorithm to
		preserve the trained cluster structure and treats each new
		prediction object individually.
