		Computation of the Double-Entry Intraclass Correlation // The
		function computes the double-entry intraclass correlation,
		which is an index of profile similarity (Furr, 2010; McCrae,
		2008). The double-entry intraclass correlation is a more
		precise index of the agreement of two empirically observed
		profiles than the often-used intraclass correlation (McCrae,
		2008). The function transforms profiles comprising correlations
		according to the Fisher z-transformation before the double-
		entry intraclass correlation is calculated. If the profiles
		comprise scores such as sum scores from various personality
		scales, it is recommended to standardize each individual score
		before entering into the function (McCrae, 2008). In case of
		missing values, the function will automatically use pairwise
		deletion. See Furr (2010) doi:10.1080/00223890903379134 or
		McCrae (2008) doi:10.1080/00223890701845104 for details.
