		Computation of the Double-Entry Intraclass Correlation // The
		function computes the profile similarity measure double-entry
		intraclass correlation. It is a more precise index of the
		agreement of two empirically observed profiles than the often
		used intraclass correlation or profile correlation. Profiles
		comprising correlations are transformed         according to
		the Fisher z transformation before the index is calculated. In
		the case of score data with different scale formats (e.g., if
		the profile        contains different IQ or a variety of
		personality tests), it is recommended to z-standardize the
		scores before entering into the function. For details,     see
