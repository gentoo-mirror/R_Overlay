		Intracardiac Electrograms // A system for importing
		electrophysiological signal, based on the 'Waveform Database
		(WFDB)' software package, written by Moody et al 2022
		doi:10.13026/gjvw-1m31. A wrapper for utilizing 'WFDB'
		functions for reading and writing signal data, as well as
		functions for visualization and analysis are provided. A stable
		and broadly compatible class for working with signal data,
		supporting the reading in of cardiac electrophysiological files
		such as intracardiac electrograms, is introduced.
