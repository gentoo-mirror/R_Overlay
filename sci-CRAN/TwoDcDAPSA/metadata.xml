		Calculate TwoDcDAPSA: PROs-Joint Contrast (PJC) Score and
		Quartiles // Provides a calculator for the two-dimensional
		clinical Disease Activity index for Psoriatic Arthritis
		(TwoDcDAPSA), a principal component-derived measure that
		complements the conventional clinical DAPSA score. The
		TwoDcDAPSA captures residual variation in patient-reported
		outcomes (pain and patient global assessment) and joint counts
		(swollen and tender) after adjusting for standardized cDAPSA
		using natural spline coefficients derived from published
		models. Residuals are standardized and combined with fixed
		principal component loadings to yield a continuous PROs-Joint
		Contrast (PJC) score and quartile groupings. The package
		applies pre-specified coefficients and loadings to new datasets
		but does not estimate spline models or principal components
		itself.
