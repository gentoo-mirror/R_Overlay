		Evaluation of Unverified Code // The purpose of this package is
		to generate trees and validate unverified code. Trees are made
		by parsing a statement into a verification tree data structure.
		This will make it easy to port the statement into another
		language. Safe statement evaluations are done by executing the
		verification trees.
