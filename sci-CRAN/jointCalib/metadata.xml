		A Joint Calibration of Totals and Quantiles // A small package
		containing functions to perform a joint calibration of totals
		and quantiles. The calibration for totals is based on Deville
		and Srndal (1992) doi:10.1080/01621459.1992.10475217, the
		calibration for quantiles is based on Harms and Duchesne (2006)
		https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/12-001-X2006001925
		5. The package uses standard calibration via the 'survey',
		'sampling' or 'laeken' packages. In addition, entropy balancing
		via the 'ebal' package and empirical likelihood based on codes
		from Wu (2005) https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/200
		5002/article/9051-eng.pdf can be used. See the paper by
		Bersewicz and Szymkowiak (2023) for details arXiv:2308.13281.
