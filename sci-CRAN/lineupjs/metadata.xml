		'HTMLWidget' Wrapper of 'LineUp' for Visual Analysis of Multi-
		Attribute Rankings // 'LineUp' is an interactive technique
		designed to create, visualize and explore rankings of items
		based on a set of heterogeneous attributes. This is a
		'htmlwidget' wrapper around the JavaScript library 'LineUp.js'.
		It is designed to be used in 'R Shiny' apps and 'R Markddown'
		files. Due to an outdated 'webkit' version of 'RStudio' it
		won't work in the integrated viewer.
