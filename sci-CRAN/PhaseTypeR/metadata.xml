		General-Purpose Phase-Type Functions // General implementation of
		core function from phase-type theory. 'PhaseTypeR' can be used
		to model continuous and discrete phase-type distributions, both
		univariate and multivariate. The package includes functions for
		outputting the mean and (co)variance of phase-type
		distributions; their density, probability and quantile
		functions; functions for random draws; functions for reward-
		transformation; and functions for plotting the distributions as
		networks. For more information on these functions please refer
		to Bladt and Nielsen (2017, ISBN: 978-1-4939-8377-3) and
		Campillo Navarro (2019)
