		Feature Allocation Neighborhood Greedy Search Algorithm // A
		neighborhood-based, greedy search algorithm is performed to
		estimate a feature allocation by minimizing the expected loss
		based on posterior samples from the feature allocation
		distribution. The method is currently under peer review but an
		earlier draft is available in Dahl, Johnson, and Andros (2022+)
