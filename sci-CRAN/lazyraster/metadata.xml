		Generate Raster Data Lazily from 'GDAL' // Read raster data at a
		specified resolution on-demand via 'GDAL' (the Geospatial Data
		Abstraction Library https://gdal.org/). Augments the 'raster'
		package by never reading data from a raster source until
		necessary for generating an in-memory 'raster' object. A
		'lazyraster' object may be cropped and converted to 'raster'
		object, and by default will only read a small amount of data
		sufficient for an overall summary. The amount of data read can
		be controlled by specifying the output dimensions.
