		Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models //
		Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or
		elastic-net regularization path for linear regression, logistic
		and multinomial regression models, Poisson regression, Cox
		model,  multiple-response Gaussian, and the grouped multinomial
		regression; see doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01 and
		doi:10.18637/jss.v039.i05. There are two new and important
		additions. The family argument can be a GLM family object,
		which opens the door to any programmed family
		(doi:10.18637/jss.v106.i01). This comes with a modest
		computational cost, so when the built-in families suffice, they
		should be used instead.  The other novelty is the relax option,
		which refits each of the active sets in the path unpenalized.
		The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise
		fashion, as described in the papers cited.
