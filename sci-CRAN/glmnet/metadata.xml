		Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models //
		Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or
		elastic-net regularization path for linear regression, logistic
		and multinomial regression models, Poisson regression and the
		Cox model. Two recent additions are the multiple-response
		Gaussian, and the grouped multinomial regression. The algorithm
		uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion, as
		described in the paper linked to via the URL below.
