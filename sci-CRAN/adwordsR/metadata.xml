		Access the 'Google Adwords' API // Allows access to selected
		services that are part of the 'Google Adwords' API
		https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/start.
		'Google Adwords' is an online advertising service by 'Google',
		that delivers Ads to users. This package offers a
		authentication process using 'OAUTH2'.  Currently, there are
		two methods of data of accessing the API, depending on the type
		of request. One method uses 'SOAP' requests which require
		building an 'XML' structure and then sent to the API. These are
		used for the 'ManagedCustomerService' and the
		'TargetingIdeaService'. The second method is by building 'AWQL'
		queries for the reporting side of the 'Google Adwords' API.
