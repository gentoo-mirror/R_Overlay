		Outcome Weights of Treatment Effect Estimators // Many treatment
		effect estimators can be written as weighted outcomes. These
		weights have established use cases like checking covariate
		balancing via packages like 'cobalt'. This package takes the
		original estimator objects and outputs these outcome weights.
		It builds on the general framework of Knaus (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2411.11559. This version is compatible with
		the 'grf' package and provides an internal implementation of
		Double Machine Learning.
