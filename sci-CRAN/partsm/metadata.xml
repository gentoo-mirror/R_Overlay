		Periodic Autoregressive Time Series Models // Basic functions to
		fit and predict periodic autoregressive time series models.
		These models are discussed in the book P.H. Franses (1996)
		"Periodicity and Stochastic Trends in Economic Time Series",
		Oxford University Press. Data set analyzed in that book is also
		provided. NOTE: the package was orphaned during several years.
		It is now only maintained, but no major enhancements are
		expected, and the maintainer cannot provide any support.
