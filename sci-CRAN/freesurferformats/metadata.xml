		Read 'FreeSurfer' Neuroimaging File Formats // Provides functions
		to read data from neuroimaging files in 'FreeSurfer'
		http://freesurfer.net/ binary formats. This includes the
		following file formats: 1) MGH/MGZ format files, which can
		contain multi-dimensional images or other data. Typically they
		contain time-series of three-dimensional brain scans acquired
		by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can also contain
		vertex-wise measures of surface morphometry data. The MGH
		format is named after the Massachusetts General Hospital, and
		the MGZ format is a compressed version of the same format. 2)
		'FreeSurfer' morphometry data files in binary 'curv' format.
		These contain vertex-wise surface measures, i.e., one scalar
		value for each vertex of a brain surface mesh. These are
		typically values like the cortical thickness or brain surface
		area at each vertex.
