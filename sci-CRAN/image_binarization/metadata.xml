		Binarize Images for Enhancing Optical Character Recognition //
		Improve optical character recognition by binarizing images. The
		package focuses primarily on local adaptive thresholding
		algorithms. In English, this means that it has the ability to
		turn a color or gray scale image into a black and white image.
		This is particularly useful as a preprocessing step for optical
		character recognition or handwritten text recognition.
