		Gene Scoring from Count Tables // Provides two methods for
		automatic calculation of gene scores from gene count tables:
		the z-score method, which requires a table of samples being
		scored and a count table with control samples, and the
		geometric mean method, which does not rely on control samples.
		The mathematical methods implemented are described by Kim et
		al. (2018) doi:10.1089/jir.2017.0127.
