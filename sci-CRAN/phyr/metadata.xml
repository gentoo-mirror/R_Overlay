		Model Based Phylogenetic Analysis // A collection of functions to
		do model-based phylogenetic analysis. It includes functions to
		calculate community phylogenetic diversity, to estimate
		correlations among functional traits while accounting for
		phylogenetic relationships, and to fit phylogenetic generalized
		linear mixed models. The Bayesian phylogenetic generalized
		linear mixed models are fitted with the 'INLA' package
		(http://www.r-inla.org).
