		Resolving Plant Taxon Names Using the Australian Plant Census //
		The process of resolving taxon names is necessary when working
		with biodiversity data. 'APCalign' uses the Australian Plant
		Census (APC) and the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI) to
		align and update plant taxon names to current, accepted
		standards. 'APCalign' also supplies information about the
		established status of plant taxa across different
		states/territories.
