		Estimation of Parameter-Dependent Network Centrality Measures //
		Provides methods for estimating parameter-dependent network
		centrality measures with linear-in-means models. Both non
		linear least squares and maximum likelihood estimators are
		implemented. The methods allow for both link and node
		heterogeneity in network effects, endogenous network formation
		and the presence of unconnected nodes. The routines also
		compare the explanatory power of parameter-dependent network
		centrality measures with those of standard measures of network
		centrality. Benefits and features of the 'econet' package are
		illustrated using data from Battaglini and Patacchini (2018),
		which examine the determinants of US campaign contributions
		when legislators care about the behavior of other legislators
		to whom they are socially connected. For additional details,
		see the vignette.
