		Robust Bayesian Variable Selection via Expectation-Maximization
		// Variable selection methods have been extensively developed
		for analyzing high-dimensional omics data within both the
		frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. This package implemented
		the spike-and-slab quantile LASSO which has been developed
		along the line of Bayesian hierarchical model but deeply rooted
		in the frequentist regularization methods by utilizing the
		ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. Therefore, the proposed
		method borrows strength from both the frequentist and Bayesian
		frameworks while overcoming their respective limitations. The
		spike-and-slab quantile LASSO can handle data irregularity in
		terms of skewness and outliers in the disease trait, compared
		to its nonrobust alternative, the spike-and-slab LASSO, which
		has also been implemented in the package. The core module of
		this package is developed in 'C++'.
