		Robust Bayesian Variable Selection via Expectation-Maximization
		// Variable selection methods have been extensively developed
		for analyzing highdimensional omics data within both the
		frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. This package provides
		implementations of the spike-and-slab quantile (group) LASSO
		which have been developed along the line of Bayesian
		hierarchical models but deeply rooted in frequentist
		regularization methods by utilizing ExpectationMaximization
		(EM) algorithm. The spike-and-slab quantile LASSO can handle
		data irregularity in terms of skewness and outliers in response
		variables, compared to its non-robust alternative, the spike-
		and-slab LASSO, which has also been implemented in the package.
		In addition, procedures for fitting the spike-and-slab quantile
		group LASSO and its non-robust counterpart have been
		implemented in the form of quantile/least-square varying
		coefficient mixed effect models for high-dimensional
		longitudinal data. The core module of this package is developed
		in 'C++'.
