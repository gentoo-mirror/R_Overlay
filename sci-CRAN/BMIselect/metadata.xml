		Bayesian MI-LASSO for Variable Selection on Multiply-Imputed
		Datasets // Provides a suite of Bayesian MI-LASSO for variable
		selection methods for multiply-imputed datasets. The package
		includes four Bayesian MI-LASSO models using shrinkage (Multi-
		Laplace, Horseshoe, ARD) and Spike-and-Slab (Spike-and-Laplace)
		priors, along with tools for model fitting via MCMC, three-step
		projection predictive variable selection, and hyperparameter
		calibration. Methods are suitable for both continuous and
		binary covariates under missing-at-random assumptions. See Zou,
		J., Wang, S. and Chen, Q. (2022), Variable Selection for
		Multiply-imputed Data: A Bayesian Framework. ArXiv, 2211.00114.
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.00114 for more details. We also provide
		the frequentist`s MI-LASSO function.
