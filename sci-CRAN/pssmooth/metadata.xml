		Flexible and Efficient Evaluation of Principal
		Surrogates/Treatment Effect Modifiers // Implements estimation
		and testing procedures for evaluating an intermediate biomarker
		response as a principal surrogate of a clinical response to
		treatment (i.e., principal stratification effect modification
		analysis), as described in Juraska M, Huang Y, and Gilbert PB,
		Inference on treatment effect modification by biomarker
		response in a three-phase sampling design (under review). The
		methods avoid the restrictive 'placebo structural risk'
		modeling assumption common to past methods and further improve
		robustness by the use of nonparametric kernel smoothing for
		biomarker density estimation. A randomized controlled two-group
		clinical efficacy trial is assumed with an ordered categorical
		or continuous univariate biomarker response measured at a fixed
		timepoint post-randomization and with a univariate baseline
		surrogate measure allowed to be observed in only a subset of
		trial participants with an observed biomarker response (see the
		flexible three-phase sampling design in the paper for details).
		Bootstrap-based procedures are available for pointwise and
		simultaneous confidence intervals and testing of four relevant
		hypotheses. Summary and plotting functions are provided for
		estimation results.
