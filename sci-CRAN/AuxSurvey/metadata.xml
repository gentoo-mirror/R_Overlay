		Survey Analysis with Auxiliary Discretized Variables //
		Probability surveys often use auxiliary continuous data from
		administrative records, but the utility of this data is
		diminished when it is discretized for confidentiality. We
		provide a set of survey estimators to make full use of
		information from the discretized variables. See Williams, S.Z.,
		Zou, J., Liu, Y., Si, Y., Galea, S. and Chen, Q. (2024),
		Improving Survey Inference Using Administrative Records Without
		Releasing Individual-Level Continuous Data. Statistics in
		Medicine, 43: 5803-5813. doi:10.1002/sim.10270 for details.
