		Phase I/II CRM Based Drug Combination Design // Implements the
		adaptive designs for integrated phase I/II trials of drug
		combinations via continual reassessment method (CRM) to
		evaluate toxicity and efficacy simultaneously for each enrolled
		patient cohort based on Bayesian inference. It supports
		patients assignment guidance in a single trial using current
		enrolled data, as well as conducting extensive simulation
		studies to evaluate operating characteristics before the trial
		starts. It includes various link functions such as empiric,
		one-parameter logistic, two-parameter logistic, and hyperbolic
		tangent, as well as considering multiple prior distributions of
		the parameters like normal distribution, gamma distribution and
		exponential distribution to accommodate diverse clinical
		scenarios. Method using Bayesian framework with empiric link
		function is described in: Wages and Conaway (2014)
