		A Swift, Versatile Phylogenomic and High-Throughput Sequencing
		Simulator // Simply and efficiently simulates (i) variants from
		reference genomes and (ii) reads from both Illumina
		https://www.illumina.com/ and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)
		https://www.pacb.com/ platforms. It can either read reference
		genomes from FASTA files or simulate new ones. Genomic variants
		can be simulated using summary statistics, phylogenies, Variant
		Call Format (VCF) files, and coalescent simulationsthe latter
		of which can include selection, recombination, and demographic
		fluctuations. 'jackalope' can simulate single, paired-end, or
		mate-pair Illumina reads, as well as PacBio reads. These
		simulations include sequencing errors, mapping qualities,
		multiplexing, and optical/polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
		duplicates. Simulating Illumina sequencing is based on ART by
		Huang et al. (2012) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr708. PacBio
		sequencing simulation is based on SimLoRD  by Stcker et al.
		(2016) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw286. All outputs can be
		written to standard file formats.
