		Model Selection of PERMANOVA Models Using AICc // Provides tools
		for model selection and model averaging of PerMANOVA models
		using Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample
		sizes (AICc) and Information Theoretic criteria principles. The
		package is built around the PERMANOVA analysis from the 'vegan'
		package and provides a streamlined workflow for generating and
		comparing models, obtaining model weights, and summarizing
		results using model averaging approaches.  The methods
		implemented in this package are based on the practical
		information- theoretic approach described by Burnham, K. P. and
		Anderson, D. R. (2002) (doi:10.1007/b97636).
