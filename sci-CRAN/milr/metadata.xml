		Multiple-Instance Logistic Regression with LASSO Penalty // The
		multiple instance data set consists of many independent
		subjects (called bags) and each subject is composed of several
		components (called instances). The outcomes of such data set
		are binary or categorical responses, and, we can only observe
		the subject-level outcomes. For example, in manufacturing
		processes, a subject is labeled as "defective" if at least one
		of its own components is defective, and otherwise, is labeled
		as "non-defective". The 'milr' package focuses on the
		predictive model for the multiple instance data set with binary
		outcomes and performs the maximum likelihood estimation with
		the Expectation-Maximization algorithm under the framework of
		logistic regression. Moreover, the LASSO penalty is attached to
		the likelihood function for simultaneous parameter estimation
		and variable selection.
