		Generalized Additive and Linear Models (GLAM) // Contains methods
		for fitting Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Generalized
		Additive Models (GAMs). Generalized regression models are
		common methods for handling data for which assuming Gaussian-
		distributed errors is not appropriate. For instance, if the
		response of interest is binary, count, or proportion data, one
		can instead model the expectation of the response based on an
		appropriate data-generating distribution. This package provides
		methods for fitting GLMs and GAMs under Beta regression,
		Poisson regression, Gamma regression, and Binomial regression
		(currently GLM only) settings. Models are fit using local
		scoring algorithms described in Hastie and Tibshirani (1990)
