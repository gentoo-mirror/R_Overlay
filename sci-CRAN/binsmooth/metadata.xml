		Generate PDFs and CDFs from Binned Data // Provides several
		methods for generating density functions based on binned data.
		Methods include step function, recursive subdivision, and
		optimized spline. Data are assumed to be nonnegative, but the
		bin widths need not be equal, and the top bin need not have an
		upper bound. All PDF smoothing methods maintain the areas
		specified by the binned data. (Equivalently, all CDF smoothing
		methods interpolate the points specified by the binned data.)
		An estimate for the mean of the distribution may be supplied as
		an optional argument, which greatly improves the reliability of
		statistics computed from the smoothed density functions.
		Includes methods for estimating the Gini coefficient, the Theil
		index, percentiles, and random deviates from a smoothed
		distribution. Among the three methods, the optimized spline
		(splinebins) is recommended for most purposes. The percentile
		and random-draw functions only support splinebins.
