		Generate PDFs and CDFs from Binned Data // Provides several
		methods for generating density functions based on binned data.
		Methods include step function, recursive subdivision, and
		optimized spline. Data are assumed to be nonnegative, the top
		bin is assumed to have no upper bound, but the bin widths need
		be equal. All PDF smoothing methods maintain the areas
		specified by the binned data. (Equivalently, all CDF smoothing
		methods interpolate the points specified by the binned data.)
		In practice, an estimate for the mean of the distribution
		should be supplied as an optional argument. Doing so greatly
		improves the reliability of statistics computed from the
		smoothed density functions. Includes methods for estimating the
		Gini coefficient, the Theil index, percentiles, and random
		deviates from a smoothed distribution. Among the three methods,
		the optimized spline (splinebins) is recommended for most
		purposes. The percentile and random-draw methods should be
		regarded as experimental, and these methods only support
		splinebins.
