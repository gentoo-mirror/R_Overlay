		Affinity Propagation Clustering // The 'apcluster' package
		implements Frey's and Dueck's Affinity Propagation clustering
		in R.  The algorithms are largely analogous to the 'Matlab'
		code published by Frey and Dueck. The package further provides
		leveraged affinity propagation and an algorithm for exemplar-
		based agglomerative clustering that can also be used to join
		clusters obtained from affinity propagation. Various plotting
		functions are available for analyzing clustering results.
