		Affinity Propagation Clustering // Implements Affinity
		Propagation clustering introduced by Frey and Dueck (2007)
		DOI:10.1126/science.1136800. The algorithms are largely
		analogous to the 'Matlab' code published by Frey and Dueck. The
		package further provides leveraged affinity propagation and an
		algorithm for exemplar-based agglomerative clustering that can
		also be used to join clusters obtained from affinity
		propagation. Various plotting functions are available for
		analyzing clustering results.
