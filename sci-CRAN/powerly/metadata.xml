		Sample Size Analysis for Psychological Networks and More // An
		implementation of the sample size computation method for
		network models proposed by Constantin et al. (2021)
		doi:10.31234/osf.io/j5v7u The implementation takes the form of
		a three-step recursive algorithm designed to find an optimal
		sample size given a model specification and a performance
		measure of interest. It starts with a Monte Carlo simulation
		step for computing the performance measure and a statistic at
		various sample sizes selected from an initial sample size
		range. It continues with a monotone curve-fitting step for
		interpolating the statistic across the entire sample size
		range. The final step employs stratified bootstrapping to
		quantify the uncertainty around the fitted curve.
