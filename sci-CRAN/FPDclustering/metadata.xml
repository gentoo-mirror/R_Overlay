		PD-Clustering and Related Methods // Probabilistic distance
		clustering (PD-clustering) is an iterative, distribution-free,
		probabilistic clustering method. PD-clustering assigns units to
		a cluster according to their probability of membership under
		the constraint that the product of the probability and the
		distance of each point to any cluster center is a constant. PD-
		clustering is a flexible method that can be used with
		elliptical clusters, outliers, or noisy data. PDQ is an
		extension of the algorithm for clusters of different sizes.
		GPDC and TPDC use a dissimilarity measure based on densities.
		Factor PD-clustering (FPDC) is a factor clustering method that
		involves a linear transformation of variables and a cluster
		optimizing the PD-clustering criterion. It works on high-
		dimensional data sets.
