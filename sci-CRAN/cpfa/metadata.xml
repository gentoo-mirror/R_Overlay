		Classification with Parallel Factor Analysis // Classification
		using Richard A. Harshman's Parallel Factors (Parafac) model
		fit to a 3-way or 4-way data array. Uses Parafac factor weights
		from one mode of this model as predictors to tune parameters
		for one or more classification methods. Supports binary and
		multiclass classification. Predicts class labels or
		probabilities and calculates multiple classification
		performance measures. Parallel computing is implemented via the
		'parallel' and 'doParallel' packages.
