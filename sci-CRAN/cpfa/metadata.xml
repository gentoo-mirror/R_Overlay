		Classification with Parallel Factor Analysis // Classification
		using Richard A. Harshman's Parallel Factor Analysis-1
		(Parafac) model or Parallel Factor Analysis-2 (Parafac2) model
		fit to a three-way or four-way data array/tensor. See Harshman
		and Lundy (1994): doi:10.1016/0167-9473(94)90132-5. Uses
		component weights from one mode of the Parafac or Parafac2
		model as features to tune parameters for one or more
		classification methods via a k-fold cross-validation procedure.
		Supports penalized logistic regression, support vector machine,
		random forest, and feed-forward neural network. Supports binary
		and multiclass classification. Predicts class labels or class
		probabilities and calculates multiple classification
		performance measures. Parallel computing is implemented via the
		'parallel' and 'doParallel' packages.
