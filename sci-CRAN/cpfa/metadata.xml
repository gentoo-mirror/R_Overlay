		Classification with Parallel Factor Analysis // Classification
		using Richard A. Harshman's Parallel Factors (Parafac) model
		fit to a 3-way or 4-way data array/tensor. See Harshman (1994)
		doi:10.1016/0167-9473(94)90132-5. Uses Parafac factor weights
		from one mode of this model as predictors to tune parameters
		for one or more classification methods. Supports penalized
		logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and
		feed-forward neural network. Supports binary and multiclass
		classification. Predicts class labels or class probabilities
		and calculates multiple classification performance measures.
		Parallel computing is implemented via the 'parallel' and
		'doParallel' packages.
