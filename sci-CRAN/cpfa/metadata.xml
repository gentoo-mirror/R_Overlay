		Classification with Parallel Factor Analysis // Classification
		using Richard A. Harshman's Parallel Factor Analysis (Parafac)
		model-1 fit to a three-way or four-way data tensor/array. See
		Harshman (1994) doi:10.1016/0167-9473(94)90132-5. Uses Parafac
		factor weights from one mode of this model as predictors to
		tune parameters for one or more classification methods via a
		k-fold cross-validation procedure. Supports penalized logistic
		regression, support vector machine, random forest, and feed-
		forward neural network. Supports binary and multiclass
		classification. Predicts class labels or class probabilities
		and calculates multiple classification performance measures.
		Parallel computing is implemented via the 'parallel' and
		'doParallel' packages.
