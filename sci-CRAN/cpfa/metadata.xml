		Classification with Parallel Factor Analysis // Classification
		using Richard A. Harshman's Parallel Factor Analysis-1
		(Parafac) model or Parallel Factor Analysis-2 (Parafac2) model
		fit to a three-way or four-way data array. See Harshman and
		Lundy (1994): doi:10.1016/0167-9473(94)90132-5. Uses component
		weights from one mode of a Parafac or Parafac2 model as
		features to tune parameters for one or more classification
		methods via a k-fold cross-validation procedure. Allows for
		constraints on different tensor modes. Supports penalized
		logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest,
		feed-forward neural network, and regularized discriminant
		analysis. Supports binary and multiclass classification.
		Predicts class labels or class probabilities and calculates
		multiple classification performance measures. Implements
		parallel computing via the 'parallel' and 'doParallel'
		packages.
