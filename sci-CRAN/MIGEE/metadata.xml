		Impute Missing Values and Fitting Linear Mixed Effect Model //
		Implements methods for estimating generalized estimating
		equations (GEE) with advanced options for flexible modeling and
		handling missing data. This package provides tools to fit and
		analyze GEE models for longitudinal data, allowing users to
		address missingness using a variety of imputation techniques.
		It supports both univariate and multivariate modeling,
		visualization of missing data patterns, and facilitates the
		transformation of data for efficient statistical analysis.
		Designed for researchers working with complex datasets, it
		ensures robust estimation and inference in longitudinal and
		clustered data settings.
