		Create, Refine, and Cluster Data Nuggets // Creating, refining,
		and clustering data nuggets. Data nuggets reduce a large
		dataset into a small collection of nuggets of data, each
		containing a center (location), weight (importance), and scale
		(variability) parameter. Data nugget centers are created by
		choosing observations in the dataset which are as equally
		spaced apart as possible. Data nugget weights are created by
		counting the number observations closest to a given data
		nuggets center. We then say the data nugget 'contains' these
		observations and the data nugget center is recalculated as the
		mean of these observations. Data nugget scales are created by
		calculating the trace of the covariance matrix of the
		observations contained within a data nugget divided by the
		dimension of the dataset. Data nuggets are refined by
		'splitting' data nuggets which have scales or shapes (defined
		as the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues of the covariance
		matrix of the observations contained within the data nugget)
		deemed too large. Data nuggets are clustered by using a
		weighted form of k-means clustering which uses both the centers
		and weights of data nuggets to optimize the clustering
		assignments.
