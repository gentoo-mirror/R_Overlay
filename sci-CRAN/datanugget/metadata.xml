		Create, and Refine Data Nuggets // Creating, and refining data
		nuggets. Data nuggets reduce a large dataset into a small
		collection of nuggets of data, each containing a center
		(location), weight (importance), and scale (variability)
		parameter. Data nugget centers are created by choosing
		observations in the dataset which are as equally spaced apart
		as possible. Data nugget weights are created by counting the
		number observations closest to a given data nuggets center. We
		then say the data nugget 'contains' these observations and the
		data nugget center is recalculated as the mean of these
		observations. Data nugget scales are created by calculating the
		trace of the covariance matrix of the observations contained
		within a data nugget divided by the dimension of the dataset.
		Data nuggets are refined by 'splitting' data nuggets which have
		scales or shapes (defined as the ratio of the two largest
		eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the observations
		contained within the data nugget) deemed too large.
