		Spatio-Temporal Estimation and Prediction for Censored/Missing
		Responses // It estimates the parameters of a censored or
		missing data in spatio-temporal models using the SAEM algorithm
		(Delyon et al., 1999). This algorithm is a stochastic
		approximation of the widely used EM algorithm and an important
		tool for models in which the E-step does not have an analytic
		form. Besides the expressions obtained to estimate the
		parameters to the proposed model, we include the calculations
		for the observed information matrix using the method developed
		by Louis (1982). To examine the performance of the fitted
		model, case-deletion measure are provided.
