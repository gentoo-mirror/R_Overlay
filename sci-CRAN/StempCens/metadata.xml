		Spatio-Temporal Estimation and Prediction for Censored/Missing
		Responses // It estimates the parameters of spatio-temporal
		models with censored or missing data using the SAEM algorithm
		(Delyon et al., 1999). This algorithm is a stochastic
		approximation of the widely used EM algorithm and is
		particularly valuable for models in which the E-step lacks a
		closed-form expression. It also provides a function to compute
		the observed information matrix using the method developed by
		Louis (1982). To assess the performance of the fitted model,
		case-deletion diagnostics are provided.
