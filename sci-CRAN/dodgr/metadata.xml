		Distances on Directed Graphs // Distances on dual-weighted
		directed graphs using priority-queue shortest paths. Weighted
		directed graphs have weights from A to B which may differ from
		those from B to A. Dual-weighted directed graphs have two sets
		of such weights. A canonical example is a street network to be
		used for routing in which routes are calculated by weighting
		distances according to the type of way and mode of transport,
		yet lengths of routes must be calculated from direct distances.
