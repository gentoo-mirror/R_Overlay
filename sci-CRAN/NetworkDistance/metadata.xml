		Distance Measures for Networks // Network is a prevalent form of
		data structure in many fields. As an object of analysis, many
		distance or metric measures have been proposed to define the
		concept of similarity between two networks. We provide a number
		of distance measures for networks. See Jurman et al (2011)
		doi:10.3233/978-1-60750-692-8-227 for an overview on spectral
		class of inter-graph distance measures.
