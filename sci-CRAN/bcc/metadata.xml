		Beta Control Charts // Applies Beta Control Charts to defined
		values. The Beta Chart presents control limits based on the
		Beta probability distribution, making it suitable for
		monitoring fraction data from a Binomial distribution as a
		replacement for p-Charts. The Beta Chart has been applied in
		three real studies and compared with control limits from three
		different schemes. The comparative analysis showed that: (i)
		the Beta approximation to the Binomial distribution is more
		appropriate for values confined within the [0, 1] interval; and
		(ii) the proposed charts are more sensitive to the average run
		length (ARL) in both in-control and out-of-control process
		monitoring. Overall, the Beta Charts outperform the Shewhart
		control charts in monitoring fraction data. For more details,
