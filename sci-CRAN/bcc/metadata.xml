		Beta Control Charts // Applies beta control charts to defined
		values, using 'qcc' package with new beta control limits. The
		Beta Chart presents the control limits based on the Beta
		probability distribution. Can be used for monitoring fraction
		data from Binomial distribution as replacement of the p-Charts.
		The Beta Chart was applied for monitoring the variables in
		three real studies, and it was compared to the control limits
		with three schemes. The comparative analysis showed that: (i)
		Beta approximation to the Binomial distribution was more
		appropriate with values confined in the [0, 1]- interval; and
		(ii) the charts proposed were more sensitive to the average run
		length (ARL), in both in-control and out-of-control processes
		monitoring. The Beta Charts outperform the Shewhart control
		charts analyzed for monitoring fraction data. ngelo Mrcio
