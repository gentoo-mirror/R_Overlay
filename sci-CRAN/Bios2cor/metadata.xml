		From Biological Sequences and Simulations to Correlation Analysis
		// The package is dedicated to computation and analysis of
		correlation/co-variation in multiple sequence alignments and in
		side chain motions during molecular dynamics simulations.
		Features include the ability to compute correlation/co-
		variation using a variety of scoring functions between either
		sequence positions in alignments or side chain dihedral angles
		in molecular dynamics simulations and to analyze the
		correlation/co-variation matrix through a variety of tools
		including network representation and principal components
		analysis.  In addition, several utility functions are based on
		the R graphical environment to provide friendly tools for help
		in data interpretation. Examples of sequence co-variation
		analysis and utility tools are provided in: Pele J, Moreau M,
		Abdi H, Rodien P, Castel H, Chabbert M. (2014)
		doi:10.1002/prot.24570. This work was supported by the Franch
		National Research Agency (Grant number: ANR-11-BSV2-026).
