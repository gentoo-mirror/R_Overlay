		From Biological Sequences and Simulations to Correlation Analysis
		// Utilities for computation and analysis of
		correlation/covariation in multiple sequence alignments and in
		side chain motions during molecular dynamics simulations.
		Features include the computation of correlation/covariation
		scores using a variety of scoring functions between either
		sequence positions in alignments or side chain dihedral angles
		in molecular dynamics simulations and utilities to analyze the
		correlation/covariation matrix through a variety of tools
		including network representation and principal components
		analysis. In addition, several utility functions are based on
		the R graphical environment to provide friendly tools for help
		in data interpretation. Examples of sequence covariation
		analysis and utility tools are provided in: (1) Pele J, Moreau
