		From Biological Sequences and Simulations to Correlation Analysis
		// Utilities for computation and analysis of
		correlation/covariation in multiple sequence alignments and in
		side chain motions during molecular dynamics simulations.
		Features include the computation of correlation/covariation
		scores using a variety of scoring functions between either
		sequence positions in alignments or side chain dihedral angles
		in molecular dynamics simulations and utilities to analyze the
		correlation/covariation matrix through a variety of tools
		including network representation and principal components
		analysis. In addition, several utility functions are based on
		the R graphical environment to provide friendly tools for help
		in data interpretation. Examples of sequence covariation
		analysis are provided in: (1) Pele J, Moreau M, Abdi H, Rodien
		P, Castel H, Chabbert M (2014) doi:10.1002/prot.24570 and (2)

		An example of side chain correlated motion analysis is provided
		in: Taddese B, Garnier A, Abdi H, Henrion D, Chabbert M (2020)
