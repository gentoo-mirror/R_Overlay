		Fast and Simple Object Serialization to Protocol Buffers //
		Optimized C++ implementations for reading and writing protocol-
		buffers. Currently supports 'rexp.proto' for serializing R
		objects and 'geobuf.proto' for geojson data. This lightweight
		package is complementary to the much larger 'RProtoBuf' package
		which provides a full featured toolkit for working with
		protocol-buffers in R.
