		Antibody Titer Analysis of Vaccinated Patients // Visualization
		of antibody titer scores is valuable for examination of
		vaccination effects. 'AntibodyTiters' visualizes antibody
		titers of all or selected patients. This package also produces
		empty excel files in a specified format, in which users can
		fill in experimental data for visualization. Excel files with
		toy data can also be produced, so that users can see how it is
		visualized before obtaining real data. The data should contain
		titer scores at pre-vaccination, after-1st shot, after-2nd
		shot, and at least one additional sampling points. Patients
		with missing values can be included. The first two sampling
		points (pre-vaccination and after-1st shot) will be plotted
		discretely, whereas those following will be plotted on a
		continuous time scale that starts from the day of second shot.
		Half-life of titer can also be calculated for each pair of
		sampling points.
