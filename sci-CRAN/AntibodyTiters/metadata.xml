		Antibody Titer Analysis of Vaccinated Patients // Visualization
		of antibody titer scores is valuable for examination of
		vaccination effects and usefulness of the antibody used for
		titer scoring. 'AntibodyTiters' visualizes antibody titers of
		all or selected patients. This package also produces empty
		excel files in a specified format, in which users can fill in
		experimental data for visualization. Excel files with toy data
		can also be produced, so that users can see how it is
		visualized before obtaining real data. The data should contain
		titer scores at pre-vaccination, after- 1st shot, after-2nd
		shot, and at least one additional sampling point. Patients with
		missing values can be included. The first three sampling points
		will be plotted discretely, whereas those following the
		after-2nd shot will be plotted on a continuous time scale
		starting from the day of second shot.
