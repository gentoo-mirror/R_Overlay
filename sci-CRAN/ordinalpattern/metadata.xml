		Tests Based on Ordinal Patterns // Ordinal patterns describe the
		dynamics of a time series by looking at the ranks of subsequent
		observations. By comparing ordinal patterns of two times
		series, Schnurr (2014) doi:10.1007/s00362-013-0536-8 defines a
		robust and non-parametric dependence measure: the ordinal
		pattern coefficient. Functions to calculate this and a method
		to detect a change in the pattern coefficient proposed in
		Schnurr and Dehling (2017) doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1164706
		are provided. Furthermore, the package contains a function for
		calculating the ordinal pattern frequencies. Generalized
		ordinal patterns as proposed by Schnurr and Fischer (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2022.107472 are also considered.
