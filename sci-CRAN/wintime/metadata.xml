		Win Time Methods for Time-to-Event Data in Clinical Trials //
		Performs an analysis of time-to-event clinical trial data using
		various "win time" methods, including 'ewt', 'ewtr', 'rmt',
		'max', 'wtr', 'rwtr', and 'pwt'. These methods are used to
		calculate and compare treatment effects on ordered composite
		endpoints. The package handles event times, event indicators,
		and treatment arm indicators and supports calculations on
		observed and resampled data. Detailed explanations of each
		method and usage examples are provided in "Use of win time for
		ordered composite endpoints in clinical trials," by Troendle et
		al. (2024)https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38417455/. For more
		information, see the package documentation or the vignette
		titled "Introduction to wintime."
