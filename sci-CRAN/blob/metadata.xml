		A Simple S3 Class for Representing Vectors of Binary Data
		('BLOBS') // R's raw vector is useful for storing a single
		binary object. What if you want to put a vector of them in a
		data frame? The 'blob' package provides the blob object, a list
		of raw vectors, suitable for use as a column in data frame.
