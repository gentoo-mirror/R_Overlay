		Tables, Labels and Some Useful Functions from Spreadsheets and
		'SPSS' Statistics // Package computes and displays tables with
		support for 'SPSS'-style labels, multiple and nested banners,
		weights, multiple-response variables and significance testing.
		There are facilities for nice output of tables in 'knitr',
		'Shiny', '*.xlsx' files, R and 'Jupyter' notebooks. Methods for
		labelled variables add value labels support to base R functions
		and to some functions from other packages. Additionally, the
		package brings popular data transformation functions from
		'SPSS' Statistics and 'Excel': 'RECODE', 'COUNT', 'COMPUTE',
		'DO IF', 'COUNTIF', 'VLOOKUP' and etc. These functions are very
		useful for data processing in marketing research surveys.
		Package intended to help people to move data processing from
		'Excel' and 'SPSS' to R.
