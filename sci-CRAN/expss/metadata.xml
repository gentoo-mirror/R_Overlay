		and 'SPSS' Statistics // Package provides tabulation functions
		with support for 'SPSS'-style labels, multiple / nested
		banners, weights, multiple-response variables and significance
		testing. There are facilities for nice output of tables in
		'knitr', 'Shiny', R and 'Jupyter' notebooks, '*.xlsx' files.

		to base R functions and to some functions from other packages.
		Additionally, the package offers useful functions for data
		processing in marketing research / social surveys - popular
		data transformation functions from 'SPSS' Statistics ('RECODE',
		'COUNT', 'COMPUTE', 'DO IF', etc.) and 'Excel' ('COUNTIF',
		'VLOOKUP', etc.). Package is intended to help people to move
		data processing from 'Excel'/'SPSS' to R.
