		A Post-Clustering Denoiser for COI-5P Barcode Data // The 'debar'
		sequence processing pipeline is designed for denoising high
		throughput sequencing data for the animal DNA barcode marker
		cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). The package is designed to detect
		and correct insertion and deletion errors within sequencer
		outputs. This is accomplished through comparison of input
		sequences against a profile hidden Markov model (PHMM) using
		the Viterbi algorithm (for algorithm details see Durbin et al.
		1998, ISBN: 9780521629713). Inserted base pairs are removed and
		deleted base pairs are accounted for through the introduction
		of a placeholder character. Since the PHMM is a probabilistic
		representation of the COI barcode, corrections are not always
		perfect. For this reason 'debar' censors base pairs adjacent to
		reported indel sites, turning them into placeholder characters
		(default is 7 base pairs in either direction, this feature can
		be disabled). Testing has shown that this censorship results in
		the correct sequence length being restored, and erroneous base
		pairs being masked the vast majority of the time (95%).
