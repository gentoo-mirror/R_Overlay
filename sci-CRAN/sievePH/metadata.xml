		Sieve Analysis Methods for Proportional Hazards Models //
		Implements a suite of semiparametric and nonparametric kernel-
		smoothed estimation and testing procedures for continuous mark-
		specific stratified hazard ratio (treatment/placebo) models in
		a randomized treatment efficacy trial with a time-to-event
		endpoint. Semiparametric methods, allowing multivariate marks,
		are described in Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2013), Mark-specific
		hazard ratio model with multivariate continuous marks: an
		application to vaccine efficacy. Biometrics 69(2):328-337
		doi:10.1111/biom.12016, and in Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2016),
		Mark-specific hazard ratio model with missing multivariate
		marks. Lifetime Data Analysis 22(4):606-25
		doi:10.1007/s10985-015-9353-9. Nonparametric kernel-smoothed
		methods, allowing univariate marks only, are described in Sun Y
		and Gilbert PB (2012), Estimation of stratified markspecific
		proportional hazards models with missing marks. Scandinavian
		Journal of Statistics}, 39(1):34-52
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9469.2011.00746.x, and in Gilbert PB and Sun
		Y (2015), Inferences on relative failure rates in stratified
		mark-specific proportional hazards models with missing marks,
		with application to human immunodeficiency virus vaccine
		efficacy trials. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society
		Series C: Applied Statistics, 64(1):49-73
		doi:10.1111/rssc.12067. Both semiparametric and nonparametric
		approaches consider two scenarios: (1) the mark is fully
		observed in all subjects who experience the event of interest,
		and (2) the mark is subject to missingness-at-random in
		subjects who experience the event of interest. For models with
		missing marks, estimators are implemented based on (i) inverse
		probability weighting (IPW) of complete cases (for the
		semiparametric framework), and (ii) augmentation of the IPW
		estimating functions by leveraging correlations between the
		mark and auxiliary data to 'impute' the augmentation term for
		subjects with missing marks (for both the semiparametric and
		nonparametric framework). The augmented IPW estimators are
		doubly robust and recommended for use with incomplete mark
		data. The semiparametric methods make two key assumptions: (i)
		the time-to-event is assumed to be conditionally independent of
		the mark given treatment, and (ii) the weight function in the
		semiparametric density ratio/biased sampling model is assumed
		to be exponential. Diagnostic testing procedures for evaluating
		validity of both assumptions are implemented. Summary and
		plotting functions are provided for estimation and inferential
		results.
