		Sieve Analysis Methods for Proportional Hazards Models //
		Implements semiparametric estimation and testing procedures for
		a continuous, possibly multivariate, mark-specific hazard ratio
		(treatment/placebo) of an event of interest in a randomized
		treatment efficacy trial with a time-to-event endpoint, as
		described in Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2013), Mark-specific
		hazard ratio model with multivariate continuous marks: an
		application to vaccine efficacy. Biometrics 69(2):328 337, and
		in Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2015), Mark-specific hazard ratio
		model with missing multivariate marks. Lifetime Data Analysis
		22(4): 606-25. The former considers continuous multivariate
		marks fully observed in all subjects who experience the event
		of interest, whereas the latter extends the previous work to
		allow multivariate marks that are subject to missingness-at-
		random. For models with missing marks, two estimators are
		implemented based on (i) inverse probability weighting (IPW) of
		complete cases, and (ii) augmentation of the IPW estimating
		functions by leveraging correlations between the mark and
		auxiliary data to 'impute' the expected profile score vectors
		for subjects with missing marks. The augmented IPW estimator is
		doubly robust and recommended for use with incomplete mark
		data. The methods make two key assumptions: (i) the time-to-
		event is assumed to be conditionally independent of the mark
		given treatment, and (ii) the weight function in the
		semiparametric density ratio/biased sampling model is assumed
		to be exponential. Diagnostic testing procedures for evaluating
		validity of both assumptions are implemented. Summary and
		plotting functions are provided for estimation and inferential
		results.
