		Bayesian Information Borrowing with Propensity Score Matching //
		Hybrid control design is a way to borrow information from
		external controls to augment concurrent controls in a
		randomized controlled trial and is expected to overcome the
		feasibility issue when adequate randomized controlled trials
		cannot be conducted. A major challenge in the hybrid control
		design is its inability to eliminate a prior-data conflict
		caused by systematic imbalances in measured or unmeasured
		confounding factors between patients in the concurrent
		treatment/control group and external controls. To prevent the
		prior-data conflict, a combined use of propensity score
		matching and Bayesian commensurate prior has been proposed in
		the context of hybrid control design. The propensity score
		matching is first performed to guarantee the balance in
		baseline characteristics, and then the Bayesian commensurate
		prior is constructed while discounting the information based on
		the similarity in outcomes between the concurrent and external
		controls. 'psBayesborrow' is a package to implement the
		propensity score matching and the Bayesian analysis with
		commensurate prior, as well as to conduct a simulation study to
		assess operating characteristics of the hybrid control design,
		where users can choose design parameters in flexible and
		straightforward ways depending on their own application.
