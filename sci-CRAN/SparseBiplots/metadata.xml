		'HJ-Biplot' using Different Ways of Penalization Plotting with
		'ggplot2' // 'HJ-Biplot' is a multivariate method that allow
		represent multivariate data on a subspace of low dimension, in
		such a way that most of the variability of the information is
		captured in a few dimensions. This package implements three new
		techniques and constructs in each case the 'HJ-Biplot',
		adapting restrictions to reduce weights and / or produce zero
		weights in the dimensions, based on the regularization
		theories. It implements three methods of regularization: Ridge,
		LASSO and Elastic Net.
