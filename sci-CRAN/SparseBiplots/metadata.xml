		'HJ Biplot' using Different Ways of Penalization // Contains a
		set of functions that allow to represent multivariate on a
		subspace of low dimension, in such a way that most of the
		variability of the information is captured. This representation
		is carried out through the 'HJ Biplot' methodology. A first
		method performs the 'HJ Biplot'.Then, the package implements
		three new techniques and constructs in each case the 'HJ
		Biplot', adapting restrictions to contract and / or produce
		zero charges in the main components, using three methods of
		regularization: Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net.
