		'HJ-Biplot' using Different Ways of Penalization Plotting with
		'ggplot2' // The 'HJ-Biplot' is a multivariate method that
		represents high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional subspace,
		capturing most of the informations variability in just a few
		dimensions. This package implements three new regularized
		versions of the HJ-Biplot: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net. These
		versions introduce restrictions that shrink or zero-out
		variable weights to improve interpretability based on
		regularization theory. All methods provide graphical
		representations using 'ggplot2'.
