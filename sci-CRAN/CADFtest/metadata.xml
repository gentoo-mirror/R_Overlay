		A Package to Perform Covariate Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root
		Tests // Hansen's (1995) Covariate-Augmented Dickey-Fuller
		(CADF) test. The only required argument is y, the Tx1 time
		series to be tested. If no stationary covariate X is passed to
		the procedure, then an ordinary ADF test is performed. The
		p-values of the test are computed using the procedure
		illustrated in Lupi (2009).
