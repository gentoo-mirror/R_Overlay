		Create Custom Taxonomies Based on the NCBI Taxonomy and GBIF
		Backbone Taxonomy // The NCBI taxonomy is a popular resource
		for taxonomic studies but it only contains data on species with
		sequence data whereas the GBIF has a more extensive coverage of
		extinct species. Taxonbridge is useful for the creation and
		analysis of custom taxonomies based on the NCBI taxonomy and
		GBIF backbone taxonomy.
