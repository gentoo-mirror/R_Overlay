		Virtual Patient Simulation by Copula Invariance Property // To
		optimize clinical trial designs and data analysis methods
		consistently through trial simulation, we need to simulate
		multivariate mixed-type virtual patient data independent of
		designs and analysis methods under evaluation. To make the
		outcome of optimization more realistic, relevant empirical
		patient level data should be utilized when its available.
		However, a few problems arise in simulating trials based on
		small empirical data, where the underlying marginal
		distributions and their dependence structure cannot be
		understood or verified thoroughly due to the limited sample
		size. To resolve this issue, we use the copula invariance
		property, which can generate the joint distribution without
		making a strong parametric assumption. The function copula.sim
		can generate virtual patient data with optional data validation
		methods that are based on energy distance and ball divergence
		measurement. The function compare.copula.sim can conduct
		comparison of marginal mean and covariance of simulated data.
		To simulate patient-level data from a hypothetical treatment
		arm that would perform differently from the observed data, the
		function new.arm.copula.sim can be used to generate new
		multivariate data with the same dependence structure of the
		original data but with a shifted mean vector.
