		Heteroskedasticity Robust Testing // Functions for testing affine
		hypotheses on the regression coefficient vector in regression
		models with heteroskedastic errors: (i) a function for
		computing various test statistics (in particular using HC0-HC4
		covariance estimators based on unrestricted or restricted
		residuals); (ii) a function for numerically approximating the
		size of a test based on such test statistics and a user-
		supplied critical value; and, most importantly, (iii) a
		function for determining size-controlling critical values for
		such test statistics and a user-supplied significance level
		(also incorporating a check of conditions under which such a
		size-controlling critical value exists). The three functions
		are based on results in Poetscher and Preinerstorfer (2021)
		"Valid Heteroskedasticity Robust Testing"
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2104.12597, which will appear as
		doi:10.1017/S0266466623000269.
