		Uniform Manifold Samplers for Topological Data Analysis //
		Uniform random samples from simple manifolds, sometimes with
		noise, are commonly used to test topological data analytic
		(TDA) tools. This package includes samplers powered by two
		techniques: analytic volume-preserving parameterizations, as
		employed by Arvo (1995) doi:10.1145/218380.218500, and
		rejection sampling, as employed by Diaconis, Holmes, and
		Shahshahani (2013) doi:10.1214/12-IMSCOLL1006.
