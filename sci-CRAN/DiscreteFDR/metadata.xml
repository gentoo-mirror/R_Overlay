		Multiple Testing Procedures with Adaptation for Discrete Tests //
		Multiple testing procedures described in the paper Dhler,
		Durand and Roquain (2018) "New FDR bounds for discrete and
		heterogeneous tests" doi:10.1214/18-EJS1441. The main
		procedures of the paper (HSU and HSD), their adaptive
		counterparts (AHSU and AHSD), and the HBR variant are available
		and are coded to take as input a set of observed p-values and
		their discrete support under the null. A function to compute
		such p-values and supports for Fisher's exact tests is also
		provided.
