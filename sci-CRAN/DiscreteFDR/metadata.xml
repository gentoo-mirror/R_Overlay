		FDR Based Multiple Testing Procedures with Adaptation for
		Discrete Tests // Implementations of the multiple testing
		procedures for discrete tests described in the paper Dhler,
		Durand and Roquain (2018) "New FDR bounds for discrete and
		heterogeneous tests" doi:10.1214/18-EJS1441. The main
		procedures of the paper (HSU and HSD), their adaptive
		counterparts (AHSU and AHSD), and the HBR variant are available
		and are coded to take as input the results of a test procedure
		from package 'DiscreteTests', or a set of observed p-values and
		their discrete support under their nulls. A shortcut function
		to obtain such p-values and supports is also provided, along
		with a wrapper allowing to apply discrete procedures directly
		to data.
