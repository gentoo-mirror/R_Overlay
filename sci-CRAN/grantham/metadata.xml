		Calculate the 'Grantham' Distance // A minimal set of routines to
		calculate the 'Grantham' distance
		doi:10.1126/science.185.4154.862. The 'Grantham' distance
		attempts to provide a proxy for the evolutionary distance
		between two amino acids based on three key chemical properties:
		composition, polarity and molecular volume. In turn,
		evolutionary distance is used as a proxy for the impact of
		missense mutations. The higher the distance, the more
		deleterious the substitution is expected to be.
