		Performance Assessment of Binary Classifier with Visualization //
		Sensitivity (or recall or true positive rate), false positive
		rate, specificity, precision (or positive predictive value),
		negative predictive value, misclassification rate, accuracy,
		F-score- these are popular metrics for assessing performance of
		binary classifier for certain threshold. These metrics are
		calculated at certain threshold values. Receiver operating
		characteristic (ROC) curve is a common tool for assessing
		overall diagnostic ability of the binary classifier. Unlike
		depending on a certain threshold, area under ROC curve (also
		known as AUC), is a summary statistic about how well a binary
		classifier performs overall for the classification task. ROCit
		package provides flexibility to easily evaluate threshold-bound
		metrics. Also, ROC curve, along with AUC, can be obtained using
		different methods, such as empirical, binormal and non-
		parametric. ROCit encompasses a wide variety of methods for
		constructing confidence interval of ROC curve and AUC. ROCit
		also features the option of constructing empirical gains table,
		which is a handy tool for direct marketing. The package offers
		options for commonly used visualization, such as, ROC curve, KS
		plot, lift plot. Along with in-built default graphics setting,
		there are rooms for manual tweak by providing the necessary
		values as function arguments. ROCit is a powerful tool offering
		a range of things, yet it is very easy to use.
