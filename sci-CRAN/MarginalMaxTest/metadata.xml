		Max-Type Test for Marginal Correlation with Bootstrap // Test the
		marginal correlation between a scalar response variable with a
		vector of explanatory variables using the max-type test with
		bootstrap. The test is based on the max-type statistic and its
		asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of no
		marginal correlation. The bootstrap procedure is used to
		approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. The
		package provides a function for performing the test. For more
		technical details, refer to Zhang and Laber (2014)
