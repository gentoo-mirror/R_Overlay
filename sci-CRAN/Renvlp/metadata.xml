		Computing Envelope Estimators // Provides a general routine,
		envMU, which allows  estimation of the M envelope of span(U)
		given root n consistent estimators of M and U. The routine
		envMU does not presume a model.  This package implements
		response envelopes,  partial response envelopes,  envelopes in
		the predictor space,  heteroscedastic envelopes,  simultaneous
		envelopes,  scaled response envelopes,  scaled envelopes in the
		predictor space,  groupwise envelopes, weighted envelopes,
		envelopes in logistic regression and envelopes in Poisson
		regression. For each of these model-based routines the package
		provides inference tools including bootstrap, cross validation,
		estimation and prediction, hypothesis testing on coefficients
		are included except for weighted envelopes. Tools for selection
		of dimension include AIC, BIC and likelihood ratio testing.
		Background is available at Cook, R. D., Forzani, L. and Su, Z.
		(2016) doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2016.05.006. Optimization is based on
		a clockwise coordinate descent algorithm.
