		Computing Envelope Estimators // Provides a general routine,
		envMU(), which allows  estimation of the M envelope of span(U)
		given root n consistent estimators of M and U. The routine
		envMU() does not presume a model.  This package implements
		response envelopes (env()),  partial response envelopes
		(penv()),  envelopes in the predictor space (xenv()),
		heteroscedastic envelopes (henv()),  simultaneous envelopes
		(stenv()),  scaled response envelopes (senv()),  scaled
		envelopes in the predictor space (sxenv()),  groupwise
		envelopes (genv()), weighted envelopes (weighted.env(),
		weighted.penv() and weighted.xenv()),  envelopes in logistic
		regression (logit.env()), and envelopes in Poisson regression
		(pois.env()). For each of these model-based routines the
		package provides inference tools including bootstrap, cross
		validation, estimation and prediction, hypothesis testing on
		coefficients are included except for weighted envelopes. Tools
		for selection of dimension include AIC, BIC and likelihood
		ratio testing.   Background is available at Cook, R. D.,
		Forzani, L. and Su, Z. (2016) doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2016.05.006.
		Optimization is based on a clockwise coordinate descent
		algorithm.
