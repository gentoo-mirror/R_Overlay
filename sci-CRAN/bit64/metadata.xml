		A S3 Class for Vectors of 64bit Integers // Package 'bit64'
		provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers. These
		are useful for handling database keys and exact counting in
		+-2^63. WARNING: do not use them as replacement for 32bit
		integers, integer64 are not supported for subscripting by
		R-core and they have different semantics when combined with
		double, e.g. integer64 + double = integer64. Class integer64
		can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames.
		Methods are available for coercion from and to logicals,
		integers, doubles, characters and factors as well as many
		elementwise and summary functions. Many fast algorithmic
		operations such as 'match' and 'order' support inter- active
		data exploration and manipulation and optionally leverage
		caching.
