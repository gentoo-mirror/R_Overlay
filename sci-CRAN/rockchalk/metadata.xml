		Regression Estimation and Presentation // A collection of
		functions for interpretation and presentation of regression
		analysis.  These functions are used to produce the statistics
		lectures in http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides. Includes
		regression diagnostics, regression tables, and plots of
		interactions and "moderator" variables. The emphasis is on
		"mean-centered" and "residual-centered" predictors. The
		vignette "rockchalk" offers a fairly comprehensive overview.
		The vignette "Rstyle" has advice about coding in R.  The
		package title "rockchalk" refers to our school motto, "Rock
		Chalk Jayhawk, Go K.U.".
