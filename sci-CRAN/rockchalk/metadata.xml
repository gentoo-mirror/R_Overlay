		Regression Estimation and Presentation // A collection of
		functions for interpretation and presentation of regression
		analysis.  These functions are used to produce the statistics
		lectures in https://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/. Includes
		regression diagnostics, regression tables, and plots of
		interactions and "moderator" variables. The emphasis is on
		"mean-centered" and "residual-centered" predictors. The
		vignette 'rockchalk' offers a fairly comprehensive overview.
		The vignette 'Rstyle' has advice about coding in R.  The
		package title 'rockchalk' refers to our school motto, 'Rock
		Chalk Jayhawk, Go K.U.'.
