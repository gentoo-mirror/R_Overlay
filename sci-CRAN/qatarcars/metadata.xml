		Data on Cars in Qatar // Fuel economy, size, performance, and
		price data for cars in Qatar in 2025. Mirrors many of the
		columns in mtcars, but uses (1) non-US-centric makes and
		models, (2) 2025 prices, and (3) metric measurements, making it
		more appropriate for use as an example dataset outside the
		United States.
