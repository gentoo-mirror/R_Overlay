		GEMMA Multivariate Linear Mixed Model // Fits a multivariate
		linear mixed effects model that uses a polygenic term, after
		Zhou  Stephens (2014)
		(https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2848). Of particular
		interest is the estimation of variance components with
		restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods. Genome-wide
		efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA), as implemented in
		the package 'gemma2', uses an expectation-maximization
		algorithm for variance components inference for use in
		quantitative trait locus studies.
