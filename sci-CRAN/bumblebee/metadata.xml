		Quantify Disease Transmission Within and Between Population
		Groups // A simple tool to quantify the amount of transmission
		of an infectious disease of interest occurring within and
		between population groups. 'bumblebee' uses counts of observed
		directed transmission pairs, identified phylogenetically from
		deep-sequence data or from epidemiological contacts, to
		quantify transmission flows within and between population
		groups accounting for sampling heterogeneity. Population groups
		might include: geographical areas (e.g. communities, regions),
		demographic groups (e.g. age, gender) or arms of a randomized
		clinical trial. See the 'bumblebee' website for statistical
		theory, documentation and examples
