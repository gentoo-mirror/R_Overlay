		Spatially-Clustered Data Analysis // Contains functions for
		statistical data analysis based on spatially-clustered
		techniques. The package allows estimating the spatially-
		clustered spatial regression models presented in Cerqueti,
		Maranzano \ Mattera (2024), "Spatially-clustered spatial
		autoregressive models with application to agricultural market
		concentration in Europe", arXiv preprint 2407.15874
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2407.15874. Specifically, the current
		release allows the estimation of the spatially-clustered linear
		regression model (SCLM), the spatially-clustered spatial
		autoregressive model (SCSAR), the spatially-clustered spatial
		Durbin model (SCSEM), and the spatially-clustered linear
		regression model with spatially-lagged exogenous covariates
		(SCSLX).
