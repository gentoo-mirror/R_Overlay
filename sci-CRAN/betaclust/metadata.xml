		A Family of Beta Mixture Models for Clustering Beta-Valued DNA
		Methylation Data // A family of novel beta mixture models
		(BMMs) has been developed by Majumdar et al. (2022)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.01938 to appositely model the beta-
		valued cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, to
		objectively identify methylation state thresholds and to
		identify the differentially methylated CpG (DMC) sites using a
		model-based clustering approach. The family of beta mixture
		models employs different parameter constraints applicable to
		different study settings. The EM algorithm is used for
		parameter estimation, with a novel approximation during the
		M-step providing tractability and ensuring computational
		feasibility.
