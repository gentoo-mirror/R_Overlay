		Discrete Event Simulation // Discrete event simulation (DES)
		involves modeling of systems having discrete, i.e. abrupt,
		state changes. For instance, when a job arrives to a queue, the
		queue length abruptly increases by 1.  This package is an R
		implementation of the event-oriented approach to DES; see the
		tutorial in Matloff (2008)
		http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/156/PLN/DESimIntro.pdf.
