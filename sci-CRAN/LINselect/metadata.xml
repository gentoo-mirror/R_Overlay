		Selection of Linear Estimators // Estimate the mean of a Gaussian
		vector, by choosing among a large collection of estimators,
		following the method developed by Y. Baraud, C. Giraud and S.
		Huet (2014) doi:10.1214/13-AIHP539. In particular it solves the
		problem of variable selection by choosing the best predictor
		among predictors emanating from different methods as lasso,
		elastic-net, adaptive lasso, pls, randomForest. Moreover, it
		can be applied for choosing the tuning parameter in a Gauss-
		lasso procedure.
