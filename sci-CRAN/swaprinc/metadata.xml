		Swap Principal Components into Regression Models // Obtaining
		accurate and stable estimates of regression coefficients can be
		challenging when the suggested statistical model has issues
		related to multicollinearity, convergence, or overfitting. One
		solution is to use principal component analysis (PCA) results
		in the regression, as discussed in Chan and Park (2005)
		doi:10.1080/01446190500039812. The swaprinc() package
		streamlines comparisons between a raw regression model with the
		full set of raw independent variables and a principal component
		regression model where principal components are estimated on a
		subset of the independent variables, then swapped into the
		regression model in place of those variables. The swaprinc()
		function compares one raw regression model to one principal
		component regression model, while the compswap() function
		compares one raw regression model to many principal component
		regression models. Package functions include parameters to
		center, scale, and undo centering and scaling, as described by
		Harvey and Hansen (2022) https://cran.r-project.org/package=Lea
		rnPCA/vignettes/Vig_03_Step_By_Step_PCA.pdf. Additionally, the
		package supports using Gifi methods to extract principal
		components from categorical variables, as outlined by Rossiter
		(2021) https://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/dgr2/_static/files/R
		_html/NonlinearPCA.html#2_Package.
