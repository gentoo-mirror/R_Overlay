		Filter and Analyze Generalised Telemetry Data from Organisms //
		Analyze telemetry datasets generalized to allow any technology.
		The filtering steps check for false positives caused by
		reflected transmissions from surfaces and false pings from
		other noise generating equipment. The filters are based on
		JSATS filtering algorithms found in package 'filteRjsats'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=filteRjsats but have been
		generalized to allow the user to define many of the filtering
		variables. Additionally, this package contains scripts used to
		help identify an optimal maximum blanking period as defined in
		Capello et al (2015) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0134002. The
		functions were written according to their manuscript
		description, but have not been reviewed by the authors for
		accuracy. It is included here as is, without warranty.
