		Estimate the Confidence Intervals for Predictive Values //
		Computes confidence intervals for the positive predictive value
		(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) based on varied
		scenarios. In situations where the proportion of diseased
		subjects does not correspond to the disease prevalence (e.g.
		case-control studies), this package provides two types of
		solutions: 1) five methods for estimating confidence intervals
		for PPV and NPV via ratio of two binomial proportions including
		Gart  Nam (1988), Walter (1975), MOVER-J (Laud, 2017), Fieller
		(1954), and Bootstrap (Efron, 1979); 2) three direct methods
		that compute the confidence intervals including Pepe (2003),
		Zhou (2007), and Delta. In prospective studies where the
		proportion of diseased subjects is an unbiased estimate of the
		disease prevalence, this package provides several methods for
		calculating the confidence intervals for PPV and NPV including
		Clopper-Pearson, Wald, Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Beta. See the
		Details and References sections in the corresponding functions.
