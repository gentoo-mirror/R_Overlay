		Climate Services' Indicators Based on Sub-Seasonal to Decadal
		Predictions // Set of generalised tools for the flexible
		computation of climate related indicators defined by the user.
		Each method represents a specific mathematical approach which
		is combined with the possibility to select an arbitrary time
		period to define the indicator. This enables a wide range of
		possibilities to tailor the most suitable indicator for each
		particular climate service application (agriculture, food
		security, energy, water management). This package is intended
		for sub-seasonal, seasonal and decadal climate predictions, but
		its methods are also applicable to other time-scales, provided
		the dimensional structure of the input is maintained.
		Additionally, the outputs of the functions in this package are
		compatible with 'CSTools'. This package was developed in the
		context of H2020 MED-GOLD (776467) and S2S4E (776787) projects.
