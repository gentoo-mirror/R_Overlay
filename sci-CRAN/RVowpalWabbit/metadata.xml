		R Interface to the Vowpal Wabbit // The 'Vowpal Wabbit' project
		is a fast out-of-core learning system sponsored by Microsoft
		Research (having started at Yahoo! Research) and written by
		John Langford along with a number of contributors. This R
		package does not include the distributed computing
		implementation of the cluster/ directory of the upstream
		sources. Use of the software as a network service is also not
		directly supported as the aim is a simpler direct call from R
		for validation and comparison. Note that this package contains
		an embedded older version of 'Vowpal Wabbit'. The package 'rvw'
		at the GitHub repo https://github.com/rvw-org/rvw-legacy can
		provide an alternative using an external 'Vowpal Wabbit'
		library installation.
