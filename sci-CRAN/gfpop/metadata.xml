		Graph-Constrained Functional Pruning Optimal Partitioning //
		Penalized parametric change-point detection by functional
		pruning dynamic programming algorithm. The successive means are
		constrained using a graph structure with edges defining the
		nature of the changes These changes can be unconstrained (type
		std), up or down constrained (type up and down) or constrained
		by a minimal size jump (type abs). The type null means that the
		graph allows us to stay on the same segment. To each edge we
		can associate some additional properties: a minimal gap size, a
		penalty, some robust parameters (K,a) for biweight (K) and
		Huber losses (K and a). The user can also constrain the
		inferred means to lie between some minimal and maximal values.
		Data is modeled by a cost with possible use of a robust loss,
		biweight and Huber (see edge parameters K and a). These costs
		should have a quadratic, log-linear or a log-log
		representation.
