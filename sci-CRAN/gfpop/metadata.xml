		Graph-Constrained Functional Pruning Optimal Partitioning //
		Penalized parametric change-point detection by functional
		pruning dynamic programming algorithm. The successive means are
		constrained using a graph structure with edges of types null,
		up, down, std or abs. To each edge we can associate some
		additional properties: a minimal gap size, a penalty, some
		robust parameters (K,a). The user can also constrain the
		inferred means to lie between some minimal and maximal values.
		Data is modeled by a quadratic cost with possible use of a
		robust loss, biweight and Huber (see edge parameters K and a).
		Other losses are also available with log-linear representation
		or a log-log representation.
