		Tree-Guided Rare Feature Selection and Logic Aggregation //
		Implementation of the tree-guided feature selection and logic
		aggregation approach introduced in Chen et al. (2024)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2024.2326621. The method enables the
		selection and aggregation of large-scale rare binary features
		with a known hierarchical structure using a convex, linearly-
		constrained regularized regression framework. The package
		facilitates the application of this method to both linear
		regression and binary classification problems by solving the
		optimization problem via the smoothing proximal gradient
		descent algorithm (Chen et al. (2012) doi:10.1214/11-AOAS514).
