		Transfer Learning for Tensor Graphical Models // Tensor Gaussian
		graphical models (GGMs) have important applications in numerous
		areas, which can interpret conditional independence structures
		within tensor data. Yet, the available tensor data in one
		single study is often limited due to high acquisition costs.
		Although relevant studies can provide additional data, it
		remains an open question how to pool such heterogeneous data.
		This package implements a transfer learning framework for
		tensor GGMs, which takes full advantage of informative
		auxiliary domains even when non-informative auxiliary domains
		are present, benefiting from the carefully designed data-
		adaptive weights. Reference: Ren, M., Zhen Y., and Wang J.
