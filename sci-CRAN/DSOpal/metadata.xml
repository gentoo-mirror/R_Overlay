		'DataSHIELD' Implementation for 'Opal' // 'DataSHIELD' is an
		infrastructure and series of R packages that enables the remote
		and 'non-disclosive' analysis of sensitive research data. This
		package is the 'DataSHIELD' interface implementation for
		'Opal', which is the data integration application for biobanks
		by 'OBiBa'. Participant data, once collected from any data
		source, must be integrated and stored in a central data
		repository under a uniform model. 'Opal' is such a central
		repository. It can import, process, validate, query, analyze,
		report, and export data. 'Opal' is the reference implementation
		of the 'DataSHIELD' infrastructure.
