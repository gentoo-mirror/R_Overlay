		Table One for 'Latex', 'Word', and 'Html' 'R Markdown' Documents
		// Table one is a tabular description of characteristics, e.g.,
		demographics of patients in a clinical trial, presented overall
		and also stratified by a categorical variable, e.g. treatment
		group.  There are many excellent packages available to create
		table one.  This package focuses on providing table one objects
		that seamlessly fit into 'R Markdown' analyses.
