		Easily Create Presentation-Ready Display Tables // Build display
		tables from tabular data with an easy-to-use set of functions.
		With its progressive approach, we can construct display tables
		with a cohesive set of table parts. Table values can be
		formatted using any of the included formatting functions.
		Footnotes and cell styles can be precisely added through a
		location targeting system. The way in which 'gt' handles things
		for you means that you don't often have to worry about the fine
		details.
