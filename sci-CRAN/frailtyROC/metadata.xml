		Time-Dependent ROC Curve Estimation for Correlated Right-Censored
		Survival Data // This contains functions that can be used to
		estimate a smoothed and a non-smoothed (empirical) time-
		dependent receiver operating characteristic curve and the
		corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic
		curve for correlated right-censored time-to-event data. See
