		Crosswalks Between Classifications of Occupations // Allows the
		user to perform approximate matching between the occupational
		classifications using concordances provided by the Institute
		for Structural Research and Faculty of Economics, University of
		Warsaw, doi:10.1111/ecot.12145. The crosswalks offer a complete
		step-by-step mapping of Standard Occupational Classification
		(2010) data to the International Standard Classification of
		Occupations (2008). We propose a mapping method based on the
		aforementioned research that converts measurements to the
		smallest possible unit of the target taxonomy, and then
		performs an aggregation/estimate to the requested degree
		Occupational Hierarchical level.
