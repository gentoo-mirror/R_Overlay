		Clinical Table Styling Tools and Utilities // The primary
		motivation of this package is to take the things that are great
		about the R packages 'flextable'
		https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/ and 'officer'
		https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/, take the standard and
		complex pieces of formatting clinical tables for regulatory
		use, and simplify the tedious pieces.
