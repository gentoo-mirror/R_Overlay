		Flexible Cutoffs for Model Fit Evaluation in Covariance-Based
		Structural Models // A toolbox to derive flexible cutoffs for
		fit indices in 'Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling'
		based on the paper by 'Niemand  Mai (2018)'
		doi:10.1007/s11747-018-0602-9. Flexible cutoffs are an
		alternative to fixed cutoffs - rules-of-thumb - regarding an
		appropriate cutoff for fit indices such as 'CFI' or 'SRMR'. It
		has been demonstrated that these flexible cutoffs perform
		better than fixed cutoffs in grey areas where misspecification
		is not easy to detect. The package provides an alternative to
		the tool at https://flexiblecutoffs.org as it allows to tailor
		flexible cutoffs to a given dataset and model, which is so far
		not available in the tool. The package simulates fit indices
		based on a given dataset and model and then estimates the
		flexible cutoffs. Some useful functions, e.g., to determine the
		'GoF-' or 'BoF-nature' of a fit index, are provided. So far,
		additional options for a relative use (is a model better than
		another?) are provided in an exploratory manner.
