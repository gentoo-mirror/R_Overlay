		Partially Replicated (p-Rep) Designs // Early generation breeding
		trials are to be conducted in multiple environments where it
		may not be possible to replicate all the lines in each
		environment due to scarcity of resources. For such situations,
		partially replicated (p-Rep) designs have wide application
		potential as only a proportion of the test lines are replicated
		at each environment. A collection of several utility functions
		related to p-Rep designs have been developed. Here, the package
		contains four functions for a complete stepwise analytical
		study of these designs. Three functions pRep1(), pRep2() and
		pRep3() are used to generate three new series of p-Rep designs
		and also compute canonical efficiency factors, variance factors
		between associates and average variance factors of these
		designs. A fourth function NCEV() is used to generate incidence
		matrix (N), information matrix (C), canonical efficiency factor
		(E) and average variance factor (V). This function is general
		in nature and can be used for studying the characterization
		properties of any block design.A construction procedure for
		p-Rep designs was given by Williams et
		al.(2011)doi:10.1002/bimj.201000102 which was tidious and time
		consuming. Here, in this package, three different methods have
		been given to generate p-Rep designs easily.
