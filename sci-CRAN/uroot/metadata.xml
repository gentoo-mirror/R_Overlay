		Unit Root Tests for Seasonal Time Series // Seasonal unit roots
		and seasonal stability tests. P-values based on response
		surface regressions are available for both tests. P-values
		based on bootstrap are available for seasonal unit root tests.
		A parallel implementation of the bootstrap method requires a
		CUDA capable GPU with compute capability = 3.0, otherwise a
		debugging version fully coded in R is used.
