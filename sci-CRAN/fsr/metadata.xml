		Handling Fuzzy Spatial Data // Support for fuzzy spatial objects,
		their operations, and fuzzy spatial inference models based on
		Spatial Plateau Algebra. It employs fuzzy set theory and fuzzy
		logic as foundation to deal with spatial fuzziness. It
		implements underlying concepts defined in the following
		research papers: (i) "Spatial Plateau Algebra: An Executable
		Type System for Fuzzy Spatial Data Types" doi:10.1109/FUZZ-
		IEEE.2018.8491565; (ii) "A Systematic Approach to Creating
		Fuzzy Region Objects from Real Spatial Data Sets"
		doi:10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2019.8858878; (iii) "Fuzzy Inference on
		Fuzzy Spatial Objects (FIFUS) for Spatial Decision Support
		Systems" doi:10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015707.
