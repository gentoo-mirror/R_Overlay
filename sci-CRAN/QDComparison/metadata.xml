		Modern Nonparametric Tools for Two-Sample Quantile and
		Distribution Comparisons // Allows practitioners to determine
		(i) if two univariate distributions (which can be continuous,
		discrete, or even mixed) are equal, (ii) how two distributions
		differ (shape differences, e.g., location, scale, etc.), and
		(iii) where two distributions differ (at which quantiles), all
		using nonparametric LP statistics. The primary reference is
		Jungreis, D. and Mukhopadhyay, S. (2018, Technical Report).
