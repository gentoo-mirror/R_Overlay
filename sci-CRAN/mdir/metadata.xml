		Bayesian Model-Based Clustering of Multi-Modal Data //
		Integrative clustering and semi-supervised prediction. This
		package includes a 'C++' implementation of both semi-supervised
		and unsupervised Multiple Dataset Integration (MDI; Kirk et
		al., 2012 https://doi-
		org.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts595), an
		extension of Bayesian mixture models to the integrative
		(multiple dataset or multi-modal) setting such as multi-omics
		analysis. The package also includes Bayesian mixture models.
		Densities allowed within MDI and the mixture model are Gaussian
		with full and diagonal covariance matrices, categorical,
		Gaussian with a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the mean
		parameter. The GP model implemented canonly handle data with
		common time points of equal separation. The Gaussian and GP
		models can be augmented with a global multivariate t
		distribution to handle outliers.
