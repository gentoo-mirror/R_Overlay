		Computation of Survey Weighted PC Based Composite Index // An
		index is created using a mathematical model that transforms
		multi-dimensional variables into a single value. These
		variables are often correlated, and while PCA-based indices can
		address the issue of multicollinearity, they typically do not
		account for survey weights, which can lead to inaccurate
		rankings of survey units such as households, districts, or
		states. To resolve this, the current package facilitates the
		development of a principal component analysis-based composite
		index by incorporating survey weights for each sample
		observation. This ensures the generation of a survey-weighted
		principal component-based normalized composite index.
		Additionally, the package provides a normalized principal
		component-based composite index and ranks the sample
		observations based on the values of the composite indices. For
