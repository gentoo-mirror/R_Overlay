		Wrapper for 'SUNDIALS' Solving ODE and Sensitivity Problem //
		Wrapper for widely used 'SUNDIALS' software (SUite of Nonlinear
		and DIfferential/ALgebraic Equation Solvers) and more precisely
		to its 'CVODES' solver. It is aiming to solve ordinary
		differential equations (ODE) and optionally pending forward
		sensitivity problem. The wrapper is made 'R' friendly by
		allowing to pass custom parameters to user's callback
		functions. Such functions can be both written in 'R' and in
		'C++' ('RcppArmadillo' flavor). In case of 'C++', performance
		is greatly improved so this option is highly advisable when
		performance matters. If provided, Jacobian matrix can be
		calculated either in dense or sparse format. In the latter case
		'rmumps' package is used to solve corresponding linear systems.
		Root finding and pending event management are optional and can
		be specified as 'R' or 'C++' functions too. This makes them a
		very flexible tool for controlling the ODE system during the
		time course simulation. 'SUNDIALS' library was published in
		Hindmarsh et al. (2005) doi:10.1145/1089014.1089020.
