		Global, Parameterwise and Joint Shrinkage Factor Estimation //
		The predictive value of a statistical model can often be
		improved by applying shrinkage methods. This can be achieved,
		e.g., by regularized regression or empirical Bayes approaches.
		Various types of shrinkage factors can also be estimated after
		a maximum likelihood. While global shrinkage modifies all
		regression coefficients by the same factor, parameterwise
		shrinkage factors differ between regression coefficients. With
		variables which are either highly correlated or associated with
		regard to contents, such as several columns of a design matrix
		describing a nonlinear effect, parameterwise shrinkage factors
		are not interpretable and a compromise between global and
		parameterwise shrinkage, termed 'joint shrinkage', is a useful
		extension. A computational shortcut to resampling-based
		shrinkage factor estimation based on DFBETA residuals can be
		applied. Global, parameterwise and joint shrinkage for models
		fitted by lm(), glm(), coxph(), or mfp() is available.
