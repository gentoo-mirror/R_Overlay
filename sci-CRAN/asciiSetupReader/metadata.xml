		Reads Fixed-Width ASCII Data Files (.txt or .dat) that Have
		Accompanying Setup Files (.sps or .sas) // Lets you open a
		fixed-width ASCII file (.txt or .dat) that has an accompanying
		setup file (.sps or .sas). These file combinations are
		sometimes referred to as .txt+.sps, .txt+.sas, .dat+.sps, or
		.dat+.sas. This will only run in a txt-sps or txt-sas pair in
		which the setup file contains instructions to open that text
		file. It will NOT open other text files, .sav, .sas, or .por
		data files.  Fixed-width ASCII files with setup files are
		common in older (pre-2000) government data.
