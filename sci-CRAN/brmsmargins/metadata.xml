		Bayesian Marginal Effects for 'brms' Models // Calculate Bayesian
		marginal effects, average marginal effects, and marginal
		coefficients (also called population averaged coefficients) for
		models fit using the 'brms' package including fixed effects,
		mixed effects, and location scale models. These are based on
		marginal predictions that integrate out random effects if
		necessary (see for example doi:10.1186/s12874-015-0046-6 and
		doi:10.1111/biom.12707).
