		A Dipping Sauce for Data Analysis and Visualizations // Works as
		an "add-on" to packages like 'shiny', 'future', as well as
		'rlang', and provides utility functions. Just like dipping
		sauce adding flavors to potato chips or pita bread, 'dipsaus'
		for data analysis and visualizations adds handy functions and
		enhancements to popular packages. The goal is to provide simple
		solutions that are frequently asked for online, such as how to
		synchronize 'shiny' inputs without freezing the app, or how to
		get memory size on 'Linux' or 'MacOS' system. The enhancements
		roughly fall into these four categories: 1. 'shiny' input
		widgets; 2. high-performance computing using the 'future'
		package; 3. modify R calls and convert among numbers, strings,
		and other objects. 4. utility functions to get system
		information such like CPU chip-set, memory limit, etc.
