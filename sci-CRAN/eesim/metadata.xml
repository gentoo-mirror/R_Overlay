		Simulate and Evaluate Time Series for Environmental Epidemiology
		// Provides functions to create simulated time series of
		environmental exposures (e.g., temperature, air pollution) and
		health outcomes for use in power analysis and simulation
		studies in environmental epidemiology. This package also
		provides functions to evaluate the results of simulation
		studies based on these simulated time series. This work was
		supported by a grant from the National Institute of
		Environmental Health Sciences (R00ES022631) and a fellowship
		from the Colorado State University Programs for Research and
		Scholarly Excellence.
