		Simulated Predicted Probabilities for Multinomial Logit Models //
		Functions to easily return simulated predicted probabilities
		and first differences for multinomial logit models. It takes a
		specified scenario and a multinomial model to predict
		probabilities with a set of coefficients, drawn from a
		simulated sampling distribution. The simulated predictions
		allow for meaningful plots with means and confidence intervals.
		The methodological approach is based on the principles laid out
		by King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000) doi:10.2307/2669316.
