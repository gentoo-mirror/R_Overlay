		Self-Validated Ensemble Models with Lasso and Relaxed-Elastic Net
		Regression // Implements Self-Validated Ensemble Models (SVEM,
		Lemkus et al. (2021) doi:10.1016/j.chemolab.2021.104439) using
		Elastic Net regression via 'glmnet' (Friedman et al.
		doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01). SVEM averages predictions from
		multiple models fitted to fractionally weighted bootstraps of
		the data, tuned with anti-correlated validation weights. Also
		implements the randomized permutation whole model test for SVEM
		(Karl (2024) doi:10.1016/j.chemolab.2024.105122). \\Code for
		the whole model test was taken from the supplementary material
		of Karl (2024). Development of this package was assisted by
		'GPT o1-preview' for code structure and documentation.
