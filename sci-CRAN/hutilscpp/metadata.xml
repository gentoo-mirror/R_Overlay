		Miscellaneous Functions in C++ // Provides utility functions that
		are simply, frequently used, but may require higher performance
		that what can be obtained from base R. Incidentally provides
		support for 'reverse geocoding', such as matching a point with
		its nearest neighbour in another array. Used as a complement to
		package 'hutils' by sacrificing compilation or installation
		time for higher running speeds. The name is a portmanteau of
		the author and 'Rcpp'.
