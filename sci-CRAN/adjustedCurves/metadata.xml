		Confounder-Adjusted Survival Curves and Cumulative Incidence
		Functions // Estimate and plot confounder-adjusted survival
		curves using either 'Direct Adjustment', 'Direct Adjustment
		with Pseudo-Values', various forms of 'Inverse Probability of
		Treatment Weighting', two forms of 'Augmented Inverse
		Probability of Treatment Weighting', 'Empirical Likelihood
		Estimation' and 'Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation'. Also
		includes a significance test for the difference between two
		adjusted survival curves and the calculation of adjusted
		restricted mean survival times.  Additionally enables the user
		to estimate and plot cause-specific confounder-adjusted
		cumulative incidence functions in the competing risks setting
		using the same methods (with some exceptions). For details, see
		Denz et. al (2022) arXiv:2203.10002v1.
