		Framework for Tick Population and Infection Modeling // Code to
		specify, run, and then visualize and analyze the results of
		Ixodidae (hard-bodied ticks) population and infection dynamics
		models. Such models exist in the literature, but the source
		code to run them is not always available. 'IxPopDyMod' provides
		an easy way for these models to be written and shared.
