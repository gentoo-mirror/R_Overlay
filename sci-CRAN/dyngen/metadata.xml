		A Multi-Modal Simulator for Spearheading Single-Cell Omics
		Analyses // A novel, multi-modal simulation engine for studying
		dynamic cellular processes at single-cell resolution. 'dyngen'
		is more flexible than current single-cell simulation engines.
		It allows better method development and benchmarking, thereby
		stimulating development and testing of novel computational
		methods. Cannoodt et al. (2021) doi:10.1038/s41467-021-24152-2.
