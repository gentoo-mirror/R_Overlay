		Probability Distribution Functions // Calculates expected values,
		variance, different moments (kth moment, truncated mean), stop-
		loss, mean excess loss, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Tail Value-at-
		Risk (TVaR) as well as some density and cumulative (survival)
		functions of continuous, discrete and compound distributions.
		This package also includes a visual 'Shiny' component to enable
		students to visualize distributions and understand the impact
		of their parameters. This package is intended to expand the
		'stats' and 'actuar' packages so as to enable students to
		develop an intuition for probability.
