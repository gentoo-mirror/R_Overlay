		Tunes AdaBoost, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting
		Machines // Contains two functions that are intended to make
		tuning supervised learning methods easy. The eztune function
		uses a genetic algorithm or quasi-Newton-Raphson optimizer to
		find the best set of tuning parameters. The user can choose the
		optimizer, the learning method, and if optimization will be
		based on accuracy obtained through resubstitution or cross-
		validation. The function eztune.cv will compute a cross-
		validated error rate. The purpose of eztune.cv is to provide a
		cross-validated accuracy when resubstitution is used for
		optimization because resubstitution typically produces an
		accuracy that is too high.
