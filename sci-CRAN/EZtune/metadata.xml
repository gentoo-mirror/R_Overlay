		Tunes AdaBoost, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, and
		Gradient Boosting Machines // Contains two functions that are
		intended to make tuning supervised learning methods easy. The
		eztune function uses a genetic algorithm or Hooke-Jeeves
		optimizer to find the best set of tuning parameters. The user
		can choose the optimizer, the learning method, and if
		optimization will be based on accuracy obtained through
		validation error, cross validation, or resubstitution. The
		function eztune.cv will compute a cross validated error rate.
		The purpose of eztune_cv is to provide a cross validated
		accuracy or MSE when resubstitution or validation data are used
		for optimization because error measures from both approaches
		can be misleading.
