		Post-Processing MCMC Outputs of Bayesian Factor Analytic Models
		// A well known identifiability issue in factor analytic models
		is the invariance with respect to orthogonal transformations.
		This problem burdens the inference under a Bayesian setup,
		where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to
		generate samples from the posterior distribution. The package
		applies a series of rotation, sign and permutation
		transformations (Papastamoulis and Ntzoufras (2020)
		arXiv:2004.05105) into raw MCMC samples of factor loadings,
		which are provided by the user. The post-processed output is
		identifiable and can be used for MCMC inference on any
		parametric function of factor loadings. Comparison of multiple
		MCMC chains is also possible.
