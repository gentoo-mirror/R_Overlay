		Multiple Change Point Detection in Structural VAR Models //
		Implementations of Thresholded Block Segmentation Scheme (TBSS)
		and Low-rank plus Sparse Two Step Procedure (LSTSP) algorithms
		for detecting multiple changes in structural VAR models. The
		package aims to address the problem of change point detection
		in piece-wise stationary VAR models, under different settings
		regarding the structure of their transition matrices
		(autoregressive dynamics); specifically, the following cases
		are included: (i) (weakly) sparse, (ii) structured sparse, and
		(iii) low rank plus sparse. It includes multiple algorithms and
		related extensions from Safikhani and Shojaie (2020)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1770097 and Bai, Safikhani and
		Michailidis (2020) doi:10.1109/TSP.2020.2993145.
