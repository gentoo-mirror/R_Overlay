		Probabilistic Suffix Trees and Variable Length Markov Chains //
		Provides a framework for analysing state sequences with
		probabilistic suffix trees (PST), the construction that stores
		variable length Markov chains (VLMC). Besides functions for
		learning and optimizing VLMC models, the PST library includes
		many additional tools to analyse sequence data with these
		models: visualization tools, functions for sequence prediction
		and artificial sequences generation, as well as for context and
		pattern mining. The package is specifically adapted to the
		field of social sciences by allowing to learn VLMC models from
		sets of individual sequences possibly containing missing
		values, and by accounting for case weights. The  library also
		allows to compute probabilistic divergence between two models,
		and to fit segmented VLMC, where sub-models fitted to distinct
		strata of the learning sample are stored in a single PST. This
		software results from research work executed within the
		framework of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in
		Research LIVES, which is financed by the Swiss National Science
		Foundation. The authors are grateful to the Swiss National
		Science Foundation for its financial support.
