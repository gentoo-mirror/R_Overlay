		R6 Class for Structural Causal Models // The implemented R6 class
		'SCM' aims to simplify working with structural causal models.
		The missing data mechanism can be defined as a part of the
		structural model. The class contains methods for 1) defining a
		structural causal model via functions, text or conditional
		probability tables, 2) printing basic information on the model,
		3) plotting the graph for the model using packages 'igraph' or
		'qgraph', 4) simulating data from the model, 5) applying an
		intervention, 6) checking the identifiability of a query using
		the R packages 'causaleffect' and 'dosearch', 7) defining the
		missing data mechanism, 8) simulating incomplete data from the
		model according to the specified missing data mechanism and 9)
		checking the identifiability in a missing data problem using
		the R package 'dosearch'. In addition, there are functions for
		running experiments and doing counterfactual inference using
		simulation.
