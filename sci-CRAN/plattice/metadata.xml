		Lattice Plot for Panel Data // It creates a lattice plot to
		visualize panel or longitudinal data. The observed values are
		plotted as dots and the fitted values as lines, both against
		time. The plot is customizable and easy to edit, even if you do
		not know how to construct a lattice plot from scratch.
