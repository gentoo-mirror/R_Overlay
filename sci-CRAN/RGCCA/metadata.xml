		Regularized and Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis
		for Multiblock Data // Multiblock data analysis concerns the
		analysis of several sets of variables (blocks) observed on the
		same group of individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA package
		are: (i) to study the relationships between blocks and (ii) to
		identify subsets of variables of each block which are active in
		their relationships with the other blocks.
