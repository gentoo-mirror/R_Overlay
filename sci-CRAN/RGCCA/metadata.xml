		Regularized and Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis
		for Multiblock Data // Multi-block data analysis concerns the
		analysis of several sets of variables (blocks) observed on the
		same group of individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA package
		are: to study the relationships between blocks and to identify
		subsets of variables of each block which are active in their
		relationships with the other blocks. This package allows to (i)
		run R/SGCCA and related methods (\link{rgcca}), (ii) help the
		user to find out the optimal parameters for R/SGCCA such as
		regularization parameters (tau or sparsity)
		(\link{rgcca_permutation}, \link{rgcca_cv}), (iii) evaluate the
		stability of the RGCCA results and their significance
		(\link{rgcca_bootstrap} and \link{rgcca_stability}), (iv) build
		predictive models from the R/SGCCA (\link{rgcca_predict}), (v)
		Generic print() and plot() functions apply to all these
		functionalities.
