		Spatial Statistical Modeling and Prediction // Fit, summarize,
		and predict for a variety of spatial statistical models.
		Parameters are estimated using various methods. Additional
		modeling features include anisotropy, random effects, partition
		factors, big data approaches, and more. Model-fit statistics
		are used to summarize, visualize, and compare models.
		Predictions at unobserved locations are readily obtainable.
