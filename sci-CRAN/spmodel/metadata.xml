		Spatial Statistical Modeling and Prediction // Fit, summarize,
		and predict for a variety of spatial statistical models applied
		to point-referenced and areal (lattice) data. Parameters are
		estimated using various methods. Additional modeling features
		include anisotropy, non-spatial random effects, partition
		factors, big data approaches, and more. Model-fit statistics
		are used to summarize, visualize, and compare models.
		Predictions at unobserved locations are readily obtainable. For
		additional details, see Dumelle et al. (2023)
