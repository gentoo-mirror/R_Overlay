		Calibration of Computer-Coded Verbal Autopsy Algorithm //
		Calibrates cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMF) estimates
		generated by computer-coded verbal autopsy (CCVA) algorithms
		from WHO-standardized verbal autopsy (VA) survey data. It
		leverages data from the multi-country Child Health and
		Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) project
		https://champshealth.org/, which determines gold standard
		causes of death via Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling (MITS).
		By modeling the CHAMPS data using the misclassification matrix
		modeling framework proposed in Pramanik et al. (2025,
		doi:10.1214/24-AOAS2006), the package includes an inventory of
		48 uncertainty-quantified misclassification matrices for three
		CCVA algorithms (EAVA, InSilicoVA, InterVA), two age groups
		(neonates aged 0-27 days and children aged 1-59 months), and
		eight "countries" (seven countries in CHAMPS -- Bangladesh,
		Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, South Africa
		-- and an estimate for countries not in CHAMPS). Given a VA-
		only data for an age group, CCVA algorithm, and country, the
		package uses the corresponding uncertainty-quantified
		misclassification matrix estimates as an informative prior, and
		utilizes the modular VA-calibration to produce calibrated CSMF
		estimates. It also supports ensemble calibration when VA-only
		data are provided for multiple algorithms. More generally, the
		package can be applied to calibrate predictions from a discrete
		classifier (or ensemble of classifiers) utilizing user-provided
		fixed or uncertainty-quantified misclassification matrices.
		This work is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
		Grant INV-034842.
