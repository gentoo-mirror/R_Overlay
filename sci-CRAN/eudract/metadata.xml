		Creates Safety Results Summary in XML to Upload to EudraCT // The
		remit of the European Clinical Trials Data Base (EudraCT
		https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ ) is to provide open access to
		summaries of all registered clinical trial results; thus aiming
		to prevent non-reporting of negative results and provide open-
		access to results to inform future research. The amount of
		information required and the format of the results, however,
		imposes a large extra workload at the end of studies on
		clinical trial units. In particular, the adverse-event-
		reporting component requires entering: each unique combination
		of treatment group and safety event; for every such event
		above, a further 4 pieces of information (body system, number
		of occurrences, number of subjects, number exposed) for non-
		serious events, plus an extra three pieces of data for serious
		adverse events (numbers of causally related events, deaths,
		causally related deaths). This package prepares the required
		statistics needed by EudraCT and formats them into the precise
		requirements to directly upload an XML file into the web
		portal, with no further data entry by hand.
