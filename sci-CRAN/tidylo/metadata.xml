		Weighted Tidy Log Odds Ratio // How can we measure how the usage
		or frequency of some feature, such as words, differs across
		some group or set, such as documents? One option is to use the
		log odds ratio, but the log odds ratio alone does not account
		for sampling variability; we haven't counted every feature the
		same number of times so how do we know which differences are
		meaningful? Enter the weighted log odds, which 'tidylo'
		provides an implementation for, using tidy data principles. In
		particular, here we use the method outlined in Monroe,
		Colaresi, and Quinn (2008) doi:10.1093/pan/mpn018 to weight the
		log odds ratio by a prior. By default, the prior is estimated
		from the data itself, an empirical Bayes approach, but an
		uninformative prior is also available.
