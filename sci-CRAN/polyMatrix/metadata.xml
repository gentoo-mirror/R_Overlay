		Infrastructure for Manipulation Polynomial Matrices //
		Implementation of class "polyMatrix" for storing a matrix of
		polynomials and implements basic matrix operations; including a
		determinant and characteristic polynomial. It is based on the
		package 'polynom' and uses a lot of its methods to implement
		matrix operations. This package includes 3 methods of
		triangularization of polynomial matrices: Extended Euclidean
		algorithm which is most classical but numerically unstable;
		Sylvester algorithm based on LQ decomposition; Interpolation
		algorithm is based on LQ decomposition and Newton
		interpolation. Both methods are described in D. Henrion  M.
