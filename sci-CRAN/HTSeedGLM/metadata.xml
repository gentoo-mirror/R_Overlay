		Hydro Thermal Time Analysis of Seed Germination Using Generalised
		Linear Model // Seed germinates through the physical process of
		water uptake by dry seed driven by the difference in water
		potential between the seed and the water. There exists seed-to-
		seed variability in the base seed water potential. Hence, there
		is a need for a distribution such that a viable seed with its
		base seed water potential germinates if and only if the soil
		water potential is more than the base seed water potential.
		This package estimates the stress tolerance and uniformity
		parameters of the seed lot for germination under various
		temperatures by using the hydro-time model of counts of
		germinated seeds under various water potentials. The
		distribution of base seed water potential has been considered
		to follow Normal, Logistic and Extreme value distribution. The
		estimated proportion of germinated seeds along with the
		estimates of stress and uniformity parameters are obtained
		using a generalised linear model. The significance test of the
		above parameters for within and between temperatures is also
		performed in the analysis. Details can be found in Kebreab and
		Murdoch (1999) doi:10.1093/jxb/50.334.655 and Bradford (2002)
