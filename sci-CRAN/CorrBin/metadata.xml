		Nonparametrics with Clustered Binary and Multinomial Data // This
		package implements non-parametric analyses for clustered binary
		and multinomial data. The elements of the cluster are assumed
		exchangeable, and identical joint distribution (also known as
		marginal compatibility, or reproducibility) is assumed for
		clusters of different sizes. A trend test based on stochastic
		ordering is implemented.
