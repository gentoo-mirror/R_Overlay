		Analyzing Data Through of Percentage of Importance Indice
		(Production Unknown) and Its Derivations // The Importance
		Index (I.I.) can determine the loss and solution sources for a
		system in certain knowledge areas (e.g., agronomy), when
		production (e.g., fruits) is known (Demolin-Leite, 2021).
		Events (e.g., agricultural pest) can have different magnitudes
		(numerical measurements), frequencies, and distributions
		(aggregate, random, or regular) of event occurrence, and I.I.
		bases in this triplet (Demolin-Leite, 2021)
		https://cjascience.com/index.php/CJAS/article/view/1009/1319.
		Usually, the higher the magnitude and frequency of aggregated
		distribution, the greater the problem or the solution (e.g.,
		natural enemies versus pests) for the system (Demolin-Leite,
		2021). However, the final production of the system is not
		always known or is difficult to determine (e.g., degraded area
		recovery). A derivation of the I.I. is the percentage of
		Importance Index-Production Unknown (% I.I.-PU) that can detect
		the loss or solution sources, when production is unknown for
		the system (Demolin-Leite, 2024) DOI:10.1590/1519-6984.253218.
