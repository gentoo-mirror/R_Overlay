		Isolate Functions for Remote Execution // Sending functions to
		remote processes can be wasteful of resources because they
		carry their environments with them. With the carrier package,
		it is easy to create functions that are isolated from their
		environment. These isolated functions, also called crates,
		print at the console with their total size and can be easily
		tested locally before being sent to a remote.
