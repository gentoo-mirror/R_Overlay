		Correct Bias in Estimated Regression Coefficients // This
		function corrects the bias in estimated regression coefficients
		due to classical additive measurement error (i.e., within-
		person variation) in logistic regressions under the main
		study/external reliability study design and the main
		study/internal reliability study design. The output includes
		the naive and corrected estimators for the regression
		coefficients; for the variance estimates of the corrected
		estimators, the extra variation due to estimating the
		parameters in the measurement error model is ignored or taken
		into account. Reference: Carroll RJ, Ruppert D, Stefanski L,
		Crainiceanu CM (2006) doi:10.1201/9781420010138.
