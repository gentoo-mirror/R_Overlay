		The Wally Calibration Plot for Risk Prediction Models // A
		prediction model is calibrated if, roughly, for any percentage
		x we can expect that x subjects out of 100 experience the event
		among all subjects that have a predicted risk of x%. A
		calibration plot provides a simple, yet useful, way of
		assessing the calibration assumption. The Wally plot consists
		of a sequence of usual calibration plots. Among the plots
		contained within the sequence, one is the actual calibration
		plot which has been obtained from the data and the others are
		obtained from similar simulated data under the calibration
		assumption. It provides the investigator with a direct visual
		understanding of the shape and sampling variability that are
		common under the calibration assumption. The original
		calibration plot from the data is included randomly among the
		simulated calibration plots, similarly to a police lineup. If
		the original calibration plot is not easily identified then the
		calibration assumption is not contradicted by the data. The
		method handles the common situations in which the data contain
		censored observations and occurrences of competing events.
