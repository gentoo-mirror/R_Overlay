		Nonparametric Bounds for the Average Causal Effect Due to Balke
		and Pearl and Extensions // Implementation of the nonparametric
		bounds for the average causal effect under an instrumental
		variable model by Balke and Pearl (Bounds on Treatment Effects
		from Studies with Imperfect Compliance, JASA, 1997, 92, 439,
		1171-1176, doi:10.2307/2965583). The package can calculate
		bounds for a binary outcome, a binary treatment/phenotype, and
		an instrument with either 2 or 3 categories. The package
		implements bounds for situations where these 3 variables are
		measured in the same dataset (trivariate data) or where the
		outcome and instrument are measured in one study and the
		treatment/phenotype and instrument are measured in another
		study (bivariate data).
