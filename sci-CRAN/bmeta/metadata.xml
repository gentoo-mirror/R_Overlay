		Bayesian Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression // Provides a
		collection of functions for conducting meta-analyses under
		Bayesian context in R. The package includes functions for
		computing various effect size or outcome measures (e.g. odds
		ratios, mean difference and incidence rate ratio) for different
		types of data based on MCMC simulations. Users are allowed to
		fit fixed- and random-effects models with different priors to
		the data. Meta-regression can be carried out if effects of
		additional covariates are observed. Furthermore, the package
		provides functions for creating posterior distribution plots
		and forest plot to display main model output. Traceplots and
		some other diagnostic plots are also available for assessing
		model fit and performance.
