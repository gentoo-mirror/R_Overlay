		Beautiful Graphical Representation of Multiplication Tables on a
		Modular Circle // By placing on a circle 10 points numbered
		from 1 to 10, and connecting them by a straight line to the
		point corresponding to its multiplication by 2. (1 must be
		connected to 1 * 2 = 2, point 2 must be set to 2 * 2 = 4, point
		3 to 3 * 2 = 6 and so on). You will obtain an amazing geometric
		figure that complicates and beautifies itself by varying the
		number of points and the multiplication table you use.
