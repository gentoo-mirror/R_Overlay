		Non-Parametric Causal Effects of Feasible Interventions Based on
		Modified Treatment Policies // Non-parametric estimators for
		casual effects based on longitudinal modified treatment
		policies as described in Diaz, Williams, Hoffman, and Schenck
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1955691, traditional point treatment,
		and traditional longitudinal effects. Continuous, binary,
		categorical treatments, and multivariate treatments are allowed
		as well are censored outcomes. The treatment mechanism is
		estimated via a density ratio classification procedure
		irrespective of treatment variable type. For both continuous
		and binary outcomes, additive treatment effects can be
		calculated and relative risks and odds ratios may be calculated
		for binary outcomes.
