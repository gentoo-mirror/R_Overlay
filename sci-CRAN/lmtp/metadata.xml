		Non-Parametric Causal Effects of Feasible Interventions Based on
		Modified Treatment Policies // Non-parametric estimators for
		casual effects based on longitudinal modified treatment
		policies as described in Diaz, Williams, and Hoffman
		(arXiv:2006.01366), traditional point treatment, and
		traditional longitudinal effects. Continuous, binary, and
		categorical treatments are allowed as well are censored
		outcomes. The treatment mechanism is estimated via a density
		ratio classification procedure irrespective of treatment
		variable type. For both continuous and binary outcomes,
		additive treatment effects can be calculated and relative risks
		and odds ratios may be calculated for binary outcomes.
		Estimation is enhanced using the Super Learner from 'sl3'
		available for download from GitHub using
		'remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")'.
