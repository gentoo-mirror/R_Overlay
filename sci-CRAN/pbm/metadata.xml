		Protein Binding Models // Binding models which are useful when
		analysing protein-ligand interactions by techniques such as
		Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) or Surface Plasmon Resonance
		(SPR). Naman B. Shah, Thomas M. Duncan (2014)
		doi:10.3791/51383. Hoang H. Nguyen et al. (2015)
		doi:10.3390/s150510481. After initial binding parameters are
		known, binding curves can be simulated and parameters can be
		varied. The models within this package may also be used to fit
		a curve to measured binding data using non-linear regression.
