		Spatial Management and Assessment of Demersal Resources for Trawl
		Fisheries // A tool for assessing bio-economic feedback in
		different management scenarios. 'smartR' (Spatial Management
		and Assessment of demersal Resources for Trawl fisheries)
		combines information from different tasks gathered within the
		European Data Collection Framework for the fishery sector. The
		'smartR' package implements the SMART model (Russo et al., 2014
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086222), through the object-oriented
		programming paradigm, and within this package it is possible to
		achieve the complete set of analyses required by the SMART
		approach: from the editing and formatting of the raw data; the
		construction and maintenance of coherent datasets; the
		numerical and visual inspection of the generated metadata; to
		the final simulation of management scenarios and the forecast
		of their effects. The interaction between the user and the
		application could take place through invocation of methods via
		the command line or could be entirely committed to the
		graphical user interfaces (GUI).
