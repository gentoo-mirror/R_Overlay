		Pathway Testing for Longitudinal Omics // A self-contained
		hypothesis is tested for a given pathway of longitudinal omics.
		'SlaPMEG' is a two-step procedure. First, a shared latent
		process mixed model is fitted over the longitudinal measures of
		omics in a pathway. This shared model allows deviation from the
		shared process at subject level (a random intercept, slope, or
		both per subject) and also at omic level (a random effect per
		omic). These random effects summarize the longitudinal trend of
		the observations which can be used to test for group
		differences using 'Globaltest' in the second step. If the
		pathway is large or the shared effect is small, the package
		fits a series of pairwise models and estimates the shared
		random effects based on them.
