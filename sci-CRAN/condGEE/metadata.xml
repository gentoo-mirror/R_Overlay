		Parameter Estimation in Conditional GEE for Recurrent Event Gap
		Times // Solves for the mean parameters, the variance
		parameter, and their asymptotic variance in a conditional GEE
		for recurrent event gap times, as described by Clement and
		Strawderman (2009) in the journal Biostatistics. Makes a
		parametric assumption for the length of the censored gap time.
