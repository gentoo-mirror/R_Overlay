		Species Richness Estimation and Modeling // Understanding the
		drivers of microbial diversity is an important frontier of
		microbial ecology, and investigating the diversity of samples
		from microbial ecosystems is a common step in any microbiome
		analysis. `breakaway` is the premier package for statistical
		analysis of microbial diversity. `breakaway` implements the
		latest and greatest estimates of species richness, as well as
		the most commonly used estimates.
