		Species Richness Estimation and Modeling // Understanding the
		drivers of microbial diversity is an important frontier of
		microbial ecology, and investigating the diversity of samples
		from microbial ecosystems is a common step in any microbiome
		analysis. 'breakaway' is the premier package for statistical
		analysis of microbial diversity. 'breakaway' implements the
		latest and greatest estimates of species richness, as well as
		the most commonly used estimates. Methods uniquely available in
		this package include objective Bayes estimators described in
		Barger and Bunge (2010) doi:10.1214/10-BA527, frequency-ratio-
		based estimators described in Willis and Bunge (2015)
		doi:10.1111/biom.12332, and as described in Willis, Whitman,
		and Bunge (2016) doi:10.1111/rssc.12206, a linear modeling
		approach for detecting changes in diversity.
