		Species Richness Estimation and Modeling // Understanding the
		drivers of microbial diversity is an important frontier of
		microbial ecology, and investigating the diversity of samples
		from microbial ecosystems is a common step in any microbiome
		analysis. 'breakaway' is the premier package for statistical
		analysis of microbial diversity. 'breakaway' implements the
		latest and greatest estimates of species richness, described in
		Willis and Bunge (2015) doi:10.1111/biom.12332, Willis et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1111/rssc.12206, and Willis (2016)
		arXiv:1604.02598, as well as the most commonly used estimates,
		including the objective Bayes approach described in Barger and
		Bunge (2010) doi:10.1214/10-BA527.
