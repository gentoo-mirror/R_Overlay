		Species Richness Estimation and Modeling // Species richness
		estimation is an important problem in biodiversity analysis.
		This package provides methods for total species richness
		estimation (observed plus unobserved) and a method for
		modelling total diversity with covariates. breakaway()
		estimates total (observed plus unobserved) species richness.
		Microbial diversity datasets are characterized by a large
		number of rare species and a small number of highly abundant
		species. The class of models implemented by breakaway() is
		flexible enough to model both these features. breakaway_nof1()
		implements a similar procedure however does not require a
		singleton count. betta() provides a method for modelling total
		diversity with covariates in a way that accounts for its
		estimated nature and thus accounts for unobserved taxa, and
		betta_random() permits random effects modelling.
