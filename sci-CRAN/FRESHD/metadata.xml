		Fast Robust Estimation of Signals in Heterogeneous Data //
		Procedure for solving the maximin problem for identical design
		across heterogeneous data groups. Particularly efficient when
		the design matrix is either orthogonal or has tensor structure.
		Orthogonal wavelets can be specified for 1d, 2d or 3d data
		simply by name. For tensor structured design the tensor
		components (two or three) may be supplied. The package also
		provides an efficient implementation of the generic magging
		estimator.
