		Assign Treatments, Power Calculations, Balances, Impact
		Evaluation of Experiments // Assists in the whole process of
		designing and evaluating Randomized Control Trials. Robust
		treatment assignment by strata/blocks, that handles misfits;
		Power calculations of the minimum detectable treatment effect
		Balance tables of T-test of covariates; Balance Regression:
		(treatment ~ all x variables) with F-test of null model;
		Impact_evaluation: Impact evaluation regressions. This function
		gives you the option to include control_vars, fixed effect
		variables, cluster variables (for robust SE), multiple
		endogenous variables and multiple heterogeneous variables (to
		test treatment effect heterogeneity) summary_statistics:
		Function that creates a summary statistics table with
		statistics rank observations in n groups: Creates a factor
		variable with n groups. Each group has a min and max label
		attach to each category. Athey, Susan, and Guido W. Imbens
		(2017) arXiv:1607.00698.
