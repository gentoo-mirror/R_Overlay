		Alternating Logistic Regression with Orthogonalized Residuals for
		Correlated Ordinal Outcomes // A modified version of
		alternating logistic regressions (ALR) with estimation based on
		orthogonalized residuals (ORTH) is implemented, which use
		paired estimating equations to jointly estimate parameters in
		marginal mean and within-association models. The within-cluster
		association between ordinal responses is modeled by global
		pairwise odds ratios (POR). A finite-sample bias correction is
		provided to POR parameter estimates based on matrix
		multiplicative adjusted orthogonalized residuals (MMORTH) for
		correcting estimating equations, and different bias-corrected
		variance estimators such as BC1, BC2, and BC3.
