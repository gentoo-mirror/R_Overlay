		Graph/Network Visualization // Build graph/network structures
		using functions for stepwise addition and deletion of nodes and
		edges. Work with data available in tables for bulk addition of
		nodes, edges, and associated metadata. Use graph selections and
		traversals to apply changes to specific nodes or edges. A wide
		selection of graph algorithms allow for the analysis of graphs.
		Visualize the graphs and take advantage of any aesthetic
		properties assigned to nodes and edges.
