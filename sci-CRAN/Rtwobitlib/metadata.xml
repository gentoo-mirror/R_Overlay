		'2bit' 'C' Library // A trimmed down copy of the "kent-core
		source tree" turned into a 'C' library for manipulation of
		'.2bit' files. See
		https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7 for a quick
		overview of the '2bit' format. The "kent-core source tree" can
		be found here: https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent-core/.
		Only the '.c' and '.h' files from the source tree that are
		related to manipulation of '.2bit' files were kept. Note that
		the package is primarily useful to developers of other R
		packages who wish to use the '2bit' 'C' library in their own
		'C'/'C++' code.
