		Analysis of Virulence // Epidemiological population dynamics
		models traditionally define a pathogen's virulence as the
		increase in the per capita rate of mortality of infected hosts
		due to infection. This package provides functions allowing
		virulence to be estimated by maximum likelihood techniques. The
		approach is based on the analysis of relative survival
		comparing survival in matching cohorts of infected vs.
		uninfected hosts (Agnew 2019) doi:10.1101/530709.
