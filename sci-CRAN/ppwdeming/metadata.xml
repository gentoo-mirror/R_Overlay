		Precision Profile Weighted Deming Regression // Weighted Deming
		regression, also known as "errors-in-variable" regression, is
		applied with suitable weights. Weights are modeled via a
		precision profile; functions are provided for implementing it
		in both known and unknown precision profile situations. The
		package provides tools for precision profile weighted Deming
		(PWD) regression. It covers two settings  one where the
		precision profiles are known either from external studies or
		from adequate replication of the X and Y readings, and one in
		which there is a plausible functional form for the precision
		profiles but the exact function must be estimated from the
		(generally singlicate) readings. The function set includes
		tools for: estimated standard errors (via jackknifing);
		standardized-residual analysis function with regression
		diagnostic tools for normality, linearity and constant
		variance; and an outlier analysis identifying significant
		outliers for closer investigation. Further information on
		mathematical derivations and applications can be found on
		arXiv: Hawkins and Kraker (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2508.02888.
