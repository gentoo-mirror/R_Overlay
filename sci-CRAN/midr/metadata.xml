		Learning from Black-Box Models by Maximum Interpretation
		Decomposition // The goal of 'midr' is to provide a model-
		agnostic method for interpreting and explaining black-box
		predictive models by creating a globally interpretable
		surrogate model. The package implements 'Maximum Interpretation
		Decomposition' (MID), a functional decomposition technique that
		finds an optimal additive approximation of the original model.
		This approximation is achieved by minimizing the squared error
		between the predictions of the black-box model and the
		surrogate model. The theoretical foundations of MID are
		described in Iwasawa  Matsumori (2025) [Forthcoming], and the
		package itself is detailed in Asashiba et al. (2025)
