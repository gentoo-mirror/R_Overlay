		HMM Toolkit for Inferring IBD Segments from SNP Genotypes //
		Implements continuous-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer
		identity-by-descent (IBD) segments shared by two individuals
		from their single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes.
		Provides posterior probabilities at each marker (forward-
		backward algorithm), prediction of IBD segments (Viterbi
		algorithm), and functions for visualising results. Supports
		both autosomal data and X-chromosomal data.
