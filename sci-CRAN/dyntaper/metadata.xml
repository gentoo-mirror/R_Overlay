		Dynamic Stem Profile Models, AKA Tree Taper Equations // Performs
		calculations with tree taper (or stem profile) equations,
		including model fitting. The package implements the methods
		from Garca, O. (2015) "Dynamic modelling of tree form"
		http://mcfns.net/index.php/Journal/article/view/MCFNS7.1_2. The
		models are parsimonious, describe well the tree bole shape over
		its full length, and are consistent with wood formation
		mechanisms through time.
