		Estimating the Age using Auricular Surface by DNE // The age is
		estimated by calculating the Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) on
		the whole auricular surface and the apex of the auricular
		surface. It involves three estimation methods: principal
		component discriminant analysis (PCQDA), and principal
		component logistic regression analysis (PCLR) methods,
		principal component regression analysis with Southeast Asian
		(A_PCR), and principal component regression analysis with
		multipopulation (M_PCR). The package is created with the data
		from the Louis Lopes Collection in Lisbon, the 21st Century
		Identified Human Remains Collection in Coimbra, and the CAL
		Milano Cemetery Skeletal Collection in Milan, and  the skeletal
		collection at Khon Kaen University (KKU) Human Skeletal
		Research Centre (HSRC), housed in the Department of Anatomy in
		the Faculty of Medicine at KKU in Khon Kaen.
