		Estimating the Age using Auricular Surface by DNE // The age is
		estimated by calculating the Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) on
		the whole auricular surface and the apex of the auricular
		surface. It involves three estimation methods: principal
		component discriminant analysis (PCQDA), principal component
		regression analysis (PCR), and principal component logistic
		regression analysis (PCLR) methods. The package is created with
		the data from the Louis Lopes Collection in Lisbon, the 21st
		Century Identified Human Remains Collection in Coimbra, and the
		CAL Milano Cemetery Skeletal Collection in Milan.
