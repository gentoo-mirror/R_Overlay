		Compute and Compare Diagnostic Test Statistics Across Groups //
		Functions for (1) computing diagnostic test statistics
		(sensitivity, specificity, etc.) from confusion matrices with
		adjustment for various base rates or known prevalence based on
		McCaffrey et al (2003) doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-0079-7_1, (2)
		computing optimal cut-off scores with different criteria
		including maximizing sensitivity, maximizing specificity, and
		maximizing the Youden Index from Youden (1950)

		CNCR2820030106%3E3.0.CO;2-3, and (3) displaying and comparing
		classification statistics and area under the receiver operating
		characteristic (ROC) curves or area under the curves (AUC)
