		Methods for Conducting Nonresponse Bias Analysis (NRBA) //
		Facilitates nonresponse bias analysis (NRBA) for survey data.
		Such data may arise from a complex sampling design with
		features such as stratification, clustering, or unequal
		probabilities of selection. Multiple types of analyses may be
		conducted: comparisons of response rates across subgroups;
		comparisons of estimates before and after weighting
		adjustments; comparisons of sample-based estimates to external
		population totals; tests of systematic differences in covariate
		means between respondents and full samples; tests of
		independence between response status and covariates; and
		modeling of outcomes and response status as a function of
		covariates. Extensive documentation and references are provided
		for each type of analysis. Krenzke, Van de Kerckhove, and
		Mohadjer (2005) http://www.asasrms.org/Proceedings/y2005/files/
		JSM2005-000572.pdf and Lohr and Riddles (2016) https://www150.s

		t=q7PyNsGR provide an overview of the methods implemented in
		this package.
