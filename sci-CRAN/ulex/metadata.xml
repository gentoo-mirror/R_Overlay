		Unique Location Extractor // Extracts coordinates of an event
		location from text based on dictionaries of landmarks, roads,
		and areas. Only returns the location of an event of interest
		and ignores other location references; for example, if
		determining the location of a road traffic crash from the text
		"crash near [location 1] heading towards [location 2]", only
		the coordinates of "location 1" would be returned. Moreover,
		accounts for differences in spelling between how a user
		references a location and how a location is captured in
		location dictionaries.
