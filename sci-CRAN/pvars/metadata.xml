		VAR Modeling for Heterogeneous Panels // Implements (1) panel
		cointegration rank tests, (2) estimators for panel vector
		autoregressive (VAR) models, and (3) identification methods for
		panel structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models as
		described in the accompanying vignette. The implemented
		functions allow to account for cross-sectional dependence and
		for structural breaks in the deterministic terms of the VAR
		processes. Among the large set of functions, particularly
		noteworthy are those that implement (1) the correlation-
		augmented inverse normal test on the cointegration rank by
		Arsova and Oersal (2021, doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2020.05.002), (2)
		the two-step estimator for pooled cointegrating vectors by
		Breitung (2005, doi:10.1081/ETC-200067895), and (3) the pooled
		identification based on independent component analysis by
		Herwartz and Wang (2024, doi:10.1002/jae.3044).
