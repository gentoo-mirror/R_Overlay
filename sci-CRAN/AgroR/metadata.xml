		Experimental Statistics and Graphics for Agricultural Sciences //
		Performs the analysis of completely randomized experimental
		designs (CRD), randomized blocks (RBD) and Latin square (LSD),
		experiments in double and triple factorial scheme (in CRD and
		RBD), experiments in subdivided plot scheme (in CRD and RBD),
		subdivided and joint analysis of experiments in CRD and RBD,
		linear regression analysis, test for two samples. The package
		performs analysis of variance, ANOVA assumptions and multiple
		comparison test of means or regression, according to Pimentel-
		Gomes (2009, ISBN: 978-85-7133-055-9), nonparametric test
		(Conover, 1999, ISBN: 0471160687), test for two samples, joint
		analysis of experiments according to Ferreira (2018, ISBN:
		978-85-7269-566-4), ANOVA of aligned ranks (Wobbrock, J.O.,
		Findlater, L., Gergle, D., Higgins, JJ (2011),
		doi:10.1145/1978942.1978963) and generalized linear model (glm)
		for binomial and Poisson family in CRD and RBD (Carvalho, FJ
		(2019), doi:10.14393/ufu.te.2019.1244). It can also be used to
		obtain descriptive measures and graphics, in addition to
		correlations and creative graphics used in agricultural
		sciences (Agronomy, Zootechnics, Food Science and related
		areas).
