		Experimental Statistics and Graphics for Agricultural Sciences //
		Performs the analysis of completely randomized experimental
		designs (CRD), randomized blocks (RBD) and Latin square (LSD),
		experiments in double and triple factorial scheme (in DIC and
		DBC), experiments in subdivided plot scheme (in DIC and DBC),
		subdivided and joint analysis of experiments in DIC and DBC,
		linear regression analysis, test for two samples. The package
		performs analysis of variance, ANOVA assumptions and multiple
		comparison test of means or regression, according to Pimentel-
		Gomes (2009, ISBN: 978-85-7269-566-4), nonparametric test
		(Conover, 1999, ISBN: 0471160687), test for two samples, joint
		analysis of experiments according to Ferreira (2018, ISBN:
		978-85-7269-566-4), Anova of aligned ranks (Wobbrock, JO,
		Findlater, L., Gergle, D.,  Higgins , JJ (2011), doi:
		10.1145/1978942.1978963 It can also be used to obtain
		descriptive measures and graphics, in addition to correlations
		and creative graphics used in agricultural sciences (Agronomy,
		Zootechnics, Food Science and related areas).
