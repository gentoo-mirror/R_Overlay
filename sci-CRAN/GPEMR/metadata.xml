		Growth Parameter Estimation Method // Provides functions for
		simulating and estimating parameters of various growth models,
		including Logistic, Exponential, Theta-logistic, Von-
		Bertalanffy, and Gompertz models. The package supports both
		simulated and real data analysis, including parameter
		estimation, visualization, and calculation of global and local
		estimates. The methods are based on research described by Md
		Aktar Ul Karim and Amiya Ranjan Bhowmick (2022) in
		(https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2363586/v1). An
		interactive web application is also available at [GPEMR Web
		App](https://gpem-r.shinyapps.io/GPEM-R/).
