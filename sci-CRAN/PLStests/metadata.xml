		Model Checking for High-Dimensional GLMs via Random Projections
		// Provides methods for testing the goodness-of-fit of
		generalized linear models (GLMs) using random projections. It
		is specifically designed for high-dimensional scenarios where
		the number of predictors substantially exceeds the sample size.
		The statistical methodologies implemented in this package are
		detailed in the paper by Wen Chen and Falong Tan (2024,
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.10721).
