		Synthetic Data Generation for Imbalanced Learning in 'R' //
		Machine learning is widely used in information-systems design.
		Yet, training algorithms on imbalanced datasets may severely
		affect performance on unseen data. For example, in some cases
		in healthcare, financial, or internet-security contexts,
		certain sub-classes are difficult to learn because they are
		underrepresented in training data. This 'R' package offers a
		flexible and efficient solution based on a new synthetic
		average neighborhood sampling algorithm ('SANSA'), which, in
		contrast to other solutions, introduces a novel placement
		parameter that can be tuned to adapt to each datasets unique
		manifestation of the imbalance. More information about the
		algorithm's parameters can be found at Nasir et al. (2022)
