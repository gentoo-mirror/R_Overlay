		Build and Tune Several Models // Frequently one needs a
		convenient way to build and tune, several models in one go.The
		goal is to provide a number of convenience functions useful in
		machine learning applications. It provides the ability to
		build,tune and obtain predictions of several models in one
		function. The models are built using 'caret' functions with
		easier to read syntax. Kuhn(2014)arXiv:1405.6974v14.
