		Build and Tune Several Models // Frequently one needs a
		convenient way to build and tune several models in one go.The
		goal is to provide a number of machine learning convenience
		functions. It provides the ability to build, tune and obtain
		predictions of several models in one function. The models are
		built using functions from 'caret' with easier to read syntax.
