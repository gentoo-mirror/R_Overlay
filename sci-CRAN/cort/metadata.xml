		Some Empiric and Nonparametric Copula Models // Provides S4
		classes and methods to fit several copula models: The classic
		empirical checkerboard copula and the empirical checkerboard
		copula with known margins, see Cuberos, Masiello and Maume-
		Deschamps (2019) doi:10.1080/03610926.2019.1586936 are
		proposed. These two models allow to fit copulas in high
		dimension with a small number of observations, and they are
		always proper copulas. Some flexibility is added via a
		possibility to differentiate the checkerboard parameter by
		dimension. The last model consist of the implementation of the
		Copula Recursive Tree algorithm proposed by Laverny, Maume-
		Deschamps, Masiello and Rullire (2020) arXiv:2005.02912,
		including the localised dimension reduction, which fits a
		copula by recursive splitting of the copula domain. We also
		provide an efficient way of mixing copulas, allowing to bag the
		algorithm into a forest, and a generic way of measuring
		d-dimensional boxes with a copula.
