		Parsing, Applying, and Manipulating Data Cleaning Rules //
		Facilitates reading and manipulating (multivariate) data
		restrictions (edit rules) on numerical and categorical data.
		Rules can be defined with common R syntax and parsed to an
		internal (matrix-like format). Rules can be manipulated with
		variable elimination and value substitution methods, allowing
		for feasibility checks and more. Data can be tested against the
		rules and erroneous fields can be found based on Fellegi and
		Holt's generalized principle. Rules dependencies can be
		visualized with using the 'igraph' package.
