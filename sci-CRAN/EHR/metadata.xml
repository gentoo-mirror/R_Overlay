		Electronic Health Record (EHR) Data Processing and Analysis Tool
		// Process and analyze Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The
		`EHR` package provides modules to perform diverse medication-
		related studies using data from EHR databases. Especially, the
		package includes modules to perform
		pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses using EHRs, as
		outlined in Choi et al. (2020). Additional modules will be
		added in future. In addition, this package provides various
		functions useful to perform Phenome Wide Association Study
		(PheWAS) to explore associations between drug exposure and
		phenotypes obtained from EHR data (Choi et al., 2018).
