		Estimation of Caribou Abundance Based on Radio Telemetry Data //
		Estimation of population size of migratory caribou herds based
		on large scale aggregations monitored by radio telemetry. It
		implements the methodology found in the article by Rivest et
		al. (1998) about caribou abundance estimation. It also includes
		a function based on the Lincoln-Petersen Index as applied to
		radio telemetry data by White and Garrott (1990).
