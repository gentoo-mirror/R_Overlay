		Calibration and Summarisation of Radiocarbon Dates // Performs
		Bayesian non-parametric calibration of multiple related
		radiocarbon determinations, and summarises the calendar age
		information to plot their joint calendar age density (see
		Heaton (2022) doi:10.1111/rssc.12599). Also models the
		occurrence of radiocarbon samples as a variable-rate
		(inhomogeneous) Poisson process, plotting the posterior
		estimate for the occurrence rate of the samples over calendar
		time, and providing information about potential change points.
