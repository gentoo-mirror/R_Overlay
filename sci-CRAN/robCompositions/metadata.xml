		Robust Estimation for Compositional Data // Methods for analysis
		of compositional data including robust methods, imputation,
		methods to replace rounded zeros, (robust) outlier detection
		for compositional data, (robust) principal component analysis
		for compositional data, (robust) factor analysis for
		compositional data, (robust) discriminant analysis for
		compositional data (Fisher rule), robust regression with
		compositional predictors and (robust) Anderson-Darling
		normality tests for compositional data as well as popular log-
		ratio transformations (addLR, cenLR, isomLR, and their inverse
		transformations). In addition, visualisation and diagnostic
		tools are implemented as well as high and low-level plot
		functions for the ternary diagram.
