		Masking, Unmasking and Restoring Confidential Data // Three key
		functionalities are present. It is able to mask confidential
		data using multiplicative noise. It is able to unmask this data
		while still preserving confidentiality. It is able to calculate
		the numerical joint density function of the original data from
		the unmasked data, as well as obtaining a sample from the
		marginal density functions of the unmasked data. The final
		results are a reasonable approximation to the original data for
		the purposes of analysis (Lin et al. (2018)
