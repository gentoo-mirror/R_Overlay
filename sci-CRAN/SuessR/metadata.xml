		Suess and Laws Corrections for Marine Stable Carbon Isotope Data
		// Generates region-specific Suess and Laws corrections for
		stable carbon isotope data from marine organisms collected
		between 1850 and 2023. Version 0.1.6 of 'SuessR' contains four
		built-in regions: the Bering Sea ('Bering Sea'), the Aleutian
		archipelago ('Aleutian Islands'), the Gulf of Alaska ('Gulf of
		Alaska'), and the subpolar North Atlantic ('Subpolar North
		Atlantic'). Users can supply their own environmental data for
		regions currently not built into the package to generate
		corrections for those regions.
