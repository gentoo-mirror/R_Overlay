		Neyman-Pearson Classification via Cost-Sensitive Learning // We
		connect the multi-class Neyman-Pearson classification (NP)
		problem to the cost-sensitive learning (CS) problem, and
		propose two algorithms (NPMC-CX and NPMC-ER) to solve the
		multi-class NP problem through cost-sensitive learning tools.
		Under certain conditions, the two algorithms are shown to
		satisfy multi-class NP properties. More details are available
		in the paper "Neyman-Pearson Multi-class Classification via
		Cost-sensitive Learning" (Ye Tian and Yang Feng, 2021), which
		will be posted on arXiv soon.
