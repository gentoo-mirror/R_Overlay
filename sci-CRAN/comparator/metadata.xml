		Comparison Functions for Clustering and Record Linkage //
		Implements functions for comparing strings, sequences and
		numeric vectors for clustering and record linkage applications.
		Supported comparison functions include: generalized edit
		distances for comparing sequences/strings, Monge-Elkan
		similarity for fuzzy comparison of token sets, and L-p
		distances for comparing numeric vectors. Where possible,
		comparison functions are implemented in C/C++ to ensure good
		performance.
