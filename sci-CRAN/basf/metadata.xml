		Plot Simple Features with 'base' Sensibilities // Resurrects the
		standard plot for shapes established by the 'base' and
		'graphics' packages. This is suited to workflows that require
		plotting using the established and traditional idioms of
		plotting spatially coincident data where it belongs. This
		package depends on 'sf' and only replaces the plot method.
