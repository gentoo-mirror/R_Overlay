		Detection and Correction of Spatial Bias in HTS Screens // Allows
		to correct bias in high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. It
		(1) Detects plate-specific spatial bias by identifying rows and
		columns of all plates of the assay affected by this bias
		(following the results of the Mann-Whitney U test) as well as
		assay-specific spatial bias by identifying well locations
		(i.e., well positions scanned across all plates of a given
		assay) affected by this bias (also following the results of the
		Mann-Whitney U test); (2) Allows one to correct plate-specific
		spatial bias using either of the three additive or either of
		the three multiplicative PMP (Partial Mean Polish) methods (the
		most appropriate spatial bias model can be either specified by
		the user or determined by the program following the results of
		the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling or Cramer-von-Mises
		two-sample test) to correct the assay measurements as well as
		to correct assay-specific spatial bias by carrying out robust
		Z-scores within each plate of the assay and then traditional
		Z-scores across well locations.
