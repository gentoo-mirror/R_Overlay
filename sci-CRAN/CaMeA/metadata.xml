		Causal Meta-Analysis for Aggregated Data // A tool for causal
		meta-analysis. This package implements the aggregation formulas
		and inference methods proposed in Berenfeld et al. (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.20168. Users can input aggregated data
		across multiple studies and compute causally meaningful
		aggregated effects of their choice (risk difference, risk
		ratio, odds ratio, etc) under user-specified population
		weighting. The built-in function camea() allows to obtain
		precise variance estimates for these effects and to compare the
		latter to a classical meta-analysis aggregate, the random
		effect model, as implemented in the 'metafor' package
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metafor.
