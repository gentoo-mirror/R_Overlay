		A Parallel Analysis with Polychoric Correlation Matrices // The
		Function performs a parallel analysis using simulated
		polychoric correlation matrices. The nth-percentile of the
		eigenvalues distribution obtained from both the randomly
		generated and the real data polychoric correlation matrices is
		returned. A plot comparing the two types of eigenvalues (real
		and simulated) will help determine the number of real
		eigenvalues that outperform random data. The function is based
		on the idea that if real data are non-normal and the polychoric
		correlation matrix is needed to perform a Factor Analysis, then
		the Parallel Analysis method used to choose a non-random number
		of factors should also be based on randomly generated
		polychoric correlation matrices and not on Pearson correlation
		matrices. Random data sets are simulated assuming or a uniform
		or a multinomial distribution or via the bootstrap method of
		resampling (i.e., random permutations of cases). Also
		Multigroup Parallel analysis is made available for random
		(uniform and multinomial distribution and with or without
		difficulty factor) and bootstrap methods. An option to choose
		between default or full output is also available as well as a
		parameter to print Fit Statistics (Chi-squared, TLI, RMSEA, RMR
		and BIC) for the factor solutions indicated by the Parallel
		Analysis.
