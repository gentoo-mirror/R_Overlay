		Optimal Partial Tetra-Allele Cross Designs // Tetra-allele cross
		often referred as four-way cross or double cross or four-line
		cross are those type of mating designs in which every cross is
		obtained by mating amongst four inbred lines. A tetra-allele
		cross can be obtained by crossing the resultant of two
		unrelated diallel crosses. A common triallel cross involving
		four inbred lines A, B, C and D can be symbolically represented
		as (A X B) X (C X D) or (A, B, C, D) or (A B C D) etc. Tetra-
		allele cross can be broadly categorized as Complete Tetra-
		allele Cross (CTaC) and Partial Tetra-allele Crosses (PTaC).
		Rawlings and Cockerham (1962)doi:10.2307/2527461 firstly
		introduced and gave the method of analysis for tetra-allele
		cross hybrids using the analysis method of single cross hybrids
		under the assumption of no linkage. The set of all possible
		four-way mating between several genotypes (individuals, clones,
		homozygous lines, etc.) leads to a CTaC. If there are N number
		of inbred lines involved in a CTaC, the the total number of
		crosses, T = N*(N-1)*(N-2)*(N-3)/8. When more number of lines
		are to be considered, the total number of crosses in CTaC also
		increases. Thus, it is almost impossible for the investigator
		to carry out the experimentation with limited available
		resource material. This situation lies in taking a fraction of
		CTaC with certain underlying properties, known as PTaC.
