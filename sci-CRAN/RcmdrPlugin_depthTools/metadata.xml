		R commander Depth Tools Plug-In // This package provides an Rcmdr
		plug-in based on the depthTools package, which implements
		different robust statistical tools for the description and
		analysis of gene expression data based on the Modified Band
		Depth, namely, the scale curves for visualizing the dispersion
		of one or various groups of samples (e.g. types of tumors), a
		rank test to decide whether two groups of samples come from a
		single distribution and two methods of supervised
		classification techniques, the DS and TAD methods.
