		R Commander Depth Tools Plug-in // We provide an Rcmdr plug-in
		based on the depthTools package, which implements different
		robust statistical tools for the description and analysis of
		gene expression data based on the Modified Band Depth, namely,
		the scale curves for visualizing the dispersion of one or
		various groups of samples (e.g. types of tumors), a rank test
		to decide whether two groups of samples come from a single
		distribution and two methods of supervised classification
		techniques, the DS and TAD methods.
