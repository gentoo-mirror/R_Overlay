		Data and Source Code From: Nitrogen Uptake and Allocation
		Estimates for Spartina Alterniflora and Distichlis Spicata //
		Contains data, code, and figures from Hill et al. (2018;
		Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology; DOI:
		10.1016/j.jembe.2018.07.006) and Hill et al. (submitted; Data
		In Brief). Datasets document plant allometry, stem heights,
		nutrient and stable isotope content, and sediment
		denitrification enzyme assays. The data and analysis offer an
		examination of nitrogen uptake and allocation in two salt marsh
		plant species.
