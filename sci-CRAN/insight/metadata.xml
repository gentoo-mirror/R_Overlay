		Easy Access to Model Information for Various Model Objects // A
		tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to
		information contained in various R models, like model formulas,
		model terms, information about random effects, data that was
		used to fit the model or data from response variables.
		'insight' mainly revolves around two types of functions:
		Functions that find (the names of) information, starting with
		'find_', and functions that get the underlying data, starting
		with 'get_'.  The package has a consistent syntax and works
		with many different model objects, where otherwise functions to
		access these information are missing.
