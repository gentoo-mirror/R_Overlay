		Assessment of Data Trial Distributions According to the Carlisle-
		Stouffer Method // Assessment of the distributions of baseline
		continuous and categorical variables in randomised trials. This
		method is based on the Carlisle-Stouffer method with Monte
		Carlo simulations. It calculates p-values for each trial
		baseline variable, as well as combined p-values for each trial
		- these p-values measure how compatible are distributions of
		trials baseline variables with random sampling. This package
		also allows for graphically plotting the cumulative frequencies
		of computed p-values. Please note that code was partly adapted
		from Carlisle JB, Loadsman JA. (2017) doi:10.1111/anae.13650.
