		A Pseudo-Random Number Generator // Provides functions for
		generating pseudo-random numbers that follow a uniform
		distribution [0,1]. Randomness tests were conducted using the
		National Institute of Standards and Technology test
		suitehttps://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/22/r1/upd1/final, along
		with additional tests. The sequence generated depends on the
		initial values and parameters. The package includes a linear
		congruence map as the decision map and three chaotic maps to
		generate the pseudo-random sequence, which follow a uniform
		distribution. Other distributions can be generated from the
		uniform distribution using the Inversion Principle Method and
		BOX-Muller transformation. Small perturbations in seed values
		result in entirely different sequences of numbers due to the
		sensitive nature of the maps being used. The chaotic nature of
		the maps helps achieve randomness in the generator.
		Additionally, the generator is capable of producing random
		bits.
