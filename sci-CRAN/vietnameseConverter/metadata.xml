		Convert Vietnamese Encodings // Conversion of characters from
		unsupported Vietnamese character encodings to Unicode
		characters. These Vietnamese encodings (TCVN3, VISCII, VPS) are
		not natively supported in R and lead to printing of wrong
		characters and garbled text (mojibake). This package fixes that
		problem and provides readable output with the correct Unicode
		characters (with or without diacritics).
