		Baseline Correction of Spectra // Collection of baseline
		correction algorithms, along with a framework and a Tcl/Tk
		enabled GUI for optimising baseline algorithm parameters.
		Typical use of the package is for removing background effects
		from spectra originating from various types of spectroscopy and
		spectrometry, possibly optimizing this with regard to
		regression or classification results. Correction methods
		include polynomial fitting, weighted local smoothers and many
		more.
