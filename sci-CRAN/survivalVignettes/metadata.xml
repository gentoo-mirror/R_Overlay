		Survival Analysis Vignettes and Optional Datasets // Vignettes
		for the 'survival' package. Split from the 'survival' package
		since the vignettes were getting large. Also, since 'survival'
		is a recommended package it cannot make use of other packages
		outside of base+recommended (e.g. 'rmarkdown').
