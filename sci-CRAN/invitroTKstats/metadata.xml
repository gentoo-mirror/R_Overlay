		In Vitro Toxicokinetic Data Processing and Analysis Pipeline // A
		set of tools for processing and analyzing in vitro
		toxicokinetic measurements in a standardized and reproducible
		pipeline. The package was developed to perform frequentist and
		Bayesian estimation on a variety of in vitro toxicokinetic
		measurements including -- but not limited to -- chemical
		fraction unbound in the presence of plasma (f_up), intrinsic
		hepatic clearance (Clint, uL/min/million hepatocytes), and
		membrane permeability for oral absorption (Caco2). The methods
		provided by the package were described in Wambaugh et al.
