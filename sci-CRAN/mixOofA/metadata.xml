		Design and Analysis of Order-of-Addition Mixture Experiments // A
		facility to generate various classes of fractional designs for
		order-of-addition experiments namely fractional order-of-
		additions orthogonal arrays, see Voelkel, Joseph G. (2019).
		"The design of order-of-addition experiments." Journal of
		Quality Technology 51:3, 230-241,
		doi:10.1080/00224065.2019.1569958. Provides facility to
		construct component orthogonal arrays, see Jian-Feng Yang,
		Fasheng Sun and Hongquan Xu (2020). "A Component Position
		Model, Analysis and Design for Order-of-Addition Experiments."
		Technometrics, doi:10.1080/00401706.2020.1764394. Supports
		generation of fractional designs for order-of-addition mixture
		experiments. Analysis of data from order-of-addition mixture
		experiments is also supported.
