		and/or results of analyses, such as visualizing data by
		displaying in one figure different groups' histograms,
		boxplots, densities, scatter plots, error-bar plots, or
		trajectory plots, by displaying scatter plots of top principal
		components or dendrograms with data points colored based on
		group information, or visualizing volcano plots to check the
		results of whole genome analyses for gene differential
		expression.
