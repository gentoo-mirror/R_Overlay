		Scoring Methodology for Ordered Factors // Starting from a given
		object representing a fitted model (within a certain set of
		model classes) whose linear predictor includes some ordered
		factor(s) among the explanatory variables, a new model is
		constructed and fitted where each named factor is replaced by a
		single numeric score, suitably chosen so that the new variable
		produces a fit comparable with the standard methodology based
		on a set of polynomial contrasts. Reference: Azzalini (2023)
