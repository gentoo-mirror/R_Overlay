		Scoring Methodology for Ordered Factors // Starting from a given
		object representing a fitted model (within a certain set of
		model classes) whose (non-)linear predictor includes some
		ordered factor(s) among the explanatory variables, a new model
		is constructed and fitted where each named factor is replaced
		by a single numeric score, suitably chosen so that the new
		variable produces a fit comparable with the standard
		methodology based on a set of polynomial contrasts. Two
		variants of the present approach have been developed, one in
		each of the next references: Azzalini (2023)
