		Detecting UN Sustainable Development Goals in Text // The United
		Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become an
		important guideline for organisations to monitor and plan their
		contributions to social, economic, and environmental
		transformations. The 'text2sdg' package is an open-source
		analysis package that identifies SDGs in text using
		scientifically developed query systems, opening up the
		opportunity to monitor any type of text-based data, such as
		scientific output or corporate publications. For more
		information regarding the methodology see Meier, Mata  Wulff
		(2022) arXiv:2110.05856.
