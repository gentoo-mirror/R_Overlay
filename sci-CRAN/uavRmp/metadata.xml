		UAV Mission Planner // The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mission
		Planner provides an easy to use workflow for planning
		autonomous obstacle avoiding surveys of rtf-UAVs to retrieve
		aerial or spot related data. It creates either intermediate
		flight control files for the DJI phantom x UAVs or ready to
		upload control files for the pixhawk based flightcontroller as
		used in the 3DR Solo. Additionally it contains some useful
		tools for digitizing and data manipulation.
