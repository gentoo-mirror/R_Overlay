		UAV Mission Planner // The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mission
		Planner provides an easy to use work flow for planning
		autonomous obstacle avoiding surveys of (almost) ready to fly
		unmanned aerial vehicles to retrieve aerial or spot related
		data. It creates either intermediate flight control files for
		the DJI phantom series or ready to upload control files for the
		pixhawk based flight controller as used in the 3DR Solo.
		Additionally it contains some useful tools for digitizing and
		data manipulation.
