		Stochastic Linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Comparative Hypotheses // An
		implementation of a phylogenetic comparative method. It can fit
		univariate among-species Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of
		phenotypic trait evolution, where the trait evolves towards a
		primary optimum. The optimum can be modelled as a single
		parameter, as multiple discrete regimes on the phylogenetic
		tree, and/or with continuous covariates.
