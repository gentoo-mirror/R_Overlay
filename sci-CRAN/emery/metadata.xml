		Accuracy Statistic Estimation for Imperfect Gold Standards //
		Produce maximum likelihood estimates of common accuracy
		statistics for multiple measurement methods when a gold
		standard is not available. An R implementation of the
		expectation maximization algorithms described in Zhou et al.
		(2011) doi:10.1002/9780470906514 with additional functions for
		creating simulated data and visualizing results. Supports
		binary, ordinal, and continuous measurement methods.
