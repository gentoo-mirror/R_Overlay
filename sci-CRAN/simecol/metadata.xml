		Simulation of Ecological (and Other) Dynamic Systems // An object
		oriented framework to simulate ecological (and other) dynamic
		systems. It can be used for differential equations, individual-
		based (or agent-based) and other models as well. It supports
		structuring of simulation scenarios (to avoid copy and paste)
		and aims to improve readability and re-usability of code.
