		Composite Likelihood Inference and Diagnostics for Replicated
		Spatial Ordinal Data // Composite likelihood parameter estimate
		and asymptotic covariance matrix are calculated for the spatial
		ordinal data with replications, where spatial ordinal response
		with covariate and both spatial exponential covariance within
		subject and independent and identically distributed measurement
		error.  Parameter estimation can be performed by either solving
		the gradient function or maximizing composite log-likelihood.
		Parametric bootstrapping is used to estimate the Godambe
		information matrix and hence the asymptotic standard error and
		covariance matrix with parallel processing option. Moreover,
		the proposed surrogate residual, which extends the results of
		Liu and Zhang (2017) doi: 10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915, can
		act as a useful tool for model diagnostics.
