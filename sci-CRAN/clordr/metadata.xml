		Composite Likelihood Inference for Spatial Ordinal Data with
		Replications // Composite likelihood parameter estimate and
		asymptotic covariance matrix are calculated for the spatial
		ordinal data with replications, where spatial ordinal response
		with covariate and both spatial exponential covariance within
		subject and independent and identically distributed measurement
		error.  Parameter estimation can be performed by either solving
		the gradient function or maximizing composite log-likelihood.
		Parametric bootstrapping is used to estimate the Godambe
		information matrix and hence the asymptotic standard error and
		covariance matrix with parallel processing option.
