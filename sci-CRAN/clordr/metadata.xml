		Composite Likelihood Inference for Spatial Ordinal Data with
		Replications // Composite likelihood parameter estimate and
		asymptotic covariance matrix are calculated for the spatial
		ordinal data with replications, where spatial ordinal response
		with covariate and both spatial exponential covariance within
		subject and independent and identically distributed measurement
		error.  Parametric bootstrapping is used to estimate the
		asymptotic standard error and covariance matrix.
