		Generalized Discrimination Score // This is an implementation of
		the Generalized Discrimination Score (also known as Two

		Generalized Discrimination Score is a generic forecast
		verification framework which can be applied to any of the
		following verification contexts: dichotomous, polychotomous
		(ordinal and nominal), continuous, probabilistic, and ensemble.
		A comprehensive description of the Generalized Discrimination
		Score, including all equations used in this package, is
		provided by Mason and Weigel (2009)
