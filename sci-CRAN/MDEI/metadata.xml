		Implementing the Method of Direct Estimation and Inference //
		Causal and statistical inference on an arbitrary treatment
		effect curve requires care in both estimation and inference.
		This package, implements the Method of Direct Estimation and
		Inference as introduced in "Estimation and Inference on
		Nonlinear and Heterogeneous Effects" by Ratkovic and Tingley
		(2023) doi:10.1086/723811.  The method takes an outcome,
		variable of theoretical interest (treatment), and set of
		variables and then returns a partial derivative (marginal
		effect) of the treatment variable at each point along with
		uncertainty intervals. The approach offers two advances. First,
		a split-sample approach is used as a guard against over-
		fitting. Second, the method uses a data-driven interval derived
		from conformal inference, rather than relying on a normality
		assumption on the error terms.
