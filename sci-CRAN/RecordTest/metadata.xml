		Inference Tools in Time Series Based on Record Statistics //
		Statistical tools based on the probabilistic properties of the
		record occurrence in a sequence of independent and identically
		distributed continuous random variables. In particular, tools
		to prepare a time series as well as distribution-free trend and
		change-point tests and graphical tools to study the record
		occurrence. Details about the implemented tools can be found in
		Castillo-Mateo et al. (2023a) doi:10.18637/jss.v106.i05 and
