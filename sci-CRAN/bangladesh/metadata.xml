		Provides Ready to Use Shapefiles for Geographical Map of
		Bangladesh // Usually, it is difficult to plot choropleth maps
		for Bangladesh in 'R'. The 'bangladesh' package provides ready-
		to-use shapefiles for different administrative regions of
		Bangladesh (e.g., Division, District, Upazila, and Union). This
		package helps users to draw thematic maps of administrative
		regions of Bangladesh easily as it comes with the 'sf' objects
		for the boundaries. It also provides functions allowing users
		to efficiently get specific area maps and center coordinates
		for regions. Users can also search for a specific area and
		calculate the centroids of those areas.
