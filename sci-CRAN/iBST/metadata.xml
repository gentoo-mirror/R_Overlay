		Improper Bagging Survival Tree // Fit a bagging survival tree on
		a mixture of population (susceptible and nonsusceptible) using
		either a pseudo R2 criterion or an adjusted Logrank criterion.
		The predictor is evaluated using the Out Of Bag Integrated
		Brier Score (IBS) and several scores of importance are computed
		for variable selection. The thresholds values for variable
		selection are computed using a nonparametric permutation test.
		See 'Cyprien Mbogning' and 'Philippe Broet'

		methods implemented in this package.
