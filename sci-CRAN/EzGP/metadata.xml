		Easy-to-Interpret Gaussian Process Models for Computer
		Experiments // Fit model for datasets with easy-to-interpret
		Gaussian process modeling, predict responses for new inputs.
		The input variables of the datasets can be quantitative,
		qualitative/categorical or mixed. The output variable of the
		datasets is a scalar (quantitative). The optimization of the
		likelihood function can be chosen by the users (see the
		documentation of EzGP_fit()). The modeling method is published
		in "EzGP: Easy-to-Interpret Gaussian Process Models for
		Computer Experiments with Both Quantitative and Qualitative
		Factors" by Qian Xiao, Abhyuday Mandal, C. Devon Lin, and
		Xinwei Deng (2022) doi:10.1137/19M1288462.
