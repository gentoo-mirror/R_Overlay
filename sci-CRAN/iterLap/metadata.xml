		Approximate Probability Densities by Iterated Laplace
		Approximations // The iterLap (iterated Laplace approximation)
		algorithm approximates a general (possibly non-normalized)
		probability density on R^p, by repeated Laplace approximations
		to the difference between current approximation and true
		density (on log scale). The final approximation is a mixture of
		multivariate normal distributions and might be used for example
		as a proposal distribution for importance sampling (eg in
		Bayesian applications). The algorithm can be seen as a
		computational generalization of the Laplace approximation
		suitable for skew or multimodal densities.
