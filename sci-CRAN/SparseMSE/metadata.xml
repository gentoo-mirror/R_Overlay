		'Multiple Systems Estimation for Sparse Capture Data' //
		Implements the routines and algorithms developed and analysed
		in "Multiple Systems Estimation for Sparse Capture Data:
		Inferential Challenges when there are Non-Overlapping Lists"
		Chan, L, Silverman, B. W., Vincent, K (2019) arXiv:1902.05156.
		This package explicitly handles situations where there are
		pairs of lists which have no observed individuals in common.
		It deals correctly with parameters whose estimated values can
		be considered as being negative infinity.  It also addresses
		other possible issues of non-existence and non-identifiability
		of maximum likelihood estimates.
