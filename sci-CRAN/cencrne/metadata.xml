		Consistent Estimation of the Number of Communities via
		Regularized Network Embedding // The network analysis plays an
		important role in numerous application domains including
		biomedicine. Estimation of the number of communities is a
		fundamental and critical issue in network analysis. Most
		existing studies assume that the number of communities is known
		a priori, or lack of rigorous theoretical guarantee on the
		estimation consistency. This method proposes a regularized
		network embedding model to simultaneously estimate the
		community structure and the number of communities in a unified
		formulation. The proposed model equips network embedding with a
		novel composite regularization term, which pushes the embedding
		vector towards its center and collapses similar community
		centers with each other. A rigorous theoretical analysis is
		conducted, establishing asymptotic consistency in terms of
		community detection and estimation of the number of
		communities. Reference: Ren, M., Zhang S. and Wang J. (2022).
