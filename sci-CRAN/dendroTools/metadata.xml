		Linear and Nonlinear Methods for Analyzing Dendroclimatological
		Data // Provides novel dendroclimatological methods, primarily
		used by the Tree-ring research community. There are two core
		functions. The first one is daily_response(), which finds the
		optimal sequence of days that are related to one or more tree-
		ring proxy records. The second one is compare_methods(), which
		effectively compares several linear and nonlinear regression
		algorithms.
