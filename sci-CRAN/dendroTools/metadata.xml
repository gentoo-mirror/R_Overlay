		Linear and Nonlinear Methods for Analyzing Daily and Monthly
		Dendroclimatological Data // Provides novel
		dendroclimatological methods, primarily used by the Tree-ring
		research community. There are four core functions. The first
		one is daily_response(), which finds the optimal sequence of
		days that are related to one or more tree-ring proxy records.
		Similar function is daily_response_seasorr(), which implements
		partial correlations in the analysis of daily response
		functions. For the enthusiast of monthly data, there is
		monthly_response() function. The last core function is
		compare_methods(), which effectively compares several linear
		and nonlinear regression algorithms on the task of climate
		reconstruction.
