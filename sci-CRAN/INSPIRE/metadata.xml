		Inferring Shared Modules from Multiple Gene Expression Datasets
		with Partially Overlapping Gene Sets // A method to infer
		modules of co-expressed genes and the dependencies among the
		modules from multiple expression datasets that may contain
		different sets of genes. Please refer to: Extracting a low-
		dimensional description of multiple gene expression datasets
