		Nonparametric Kernel Smoothing Methods for Mixed Data Types //
		Nonparametric (and semiparametric) kernel methods that
		seamlessly handle a mix of continuous, unordered, and ordered
		factor data types. We would like to gratefully acknowledge
		support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research
		Council of Canada (NSERC, https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/), the
		Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada
		(SSHRC, https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/), and the Shared
		Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET,
		https://sharcnet.ca/). We would also like to acknowledge the
		contributions of the GNU GSL authors. In particular, we adapt
		the GNU GSL B-spline routine gsl_bspline.c adding automated
		support for quantile knots (in addition to uniform knots),
		providing missing functionality for derivatives, and for
		extending the splines beyond their endpoints.
