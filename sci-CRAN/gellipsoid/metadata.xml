		Generalized Ellipsoids // Represents generalized geometric
		ellipsoids with the "(U,D)" representation. It allows
		degenerate and/or unbounded ellipsoids, together with methods
		for linear and duality transformations, and for plotting. Thus
		ellipsoids are naturally extended to include lines,
		hyperplanes, points, cylinders, etc. This permits exploration
		of a variety to statistical issues that can be visualized using
		ellipsoids as discussed by Friendly, Fox  Monette (2013),
