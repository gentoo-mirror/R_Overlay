		B-Value and Empirical Equivalence Bound // Calculates B-value and
		empirical equivalence bound. B-value is defined as the maximum
		magnitude of a confidence interval; and the empirical
		equivalence bound is the minimum B-value at a certain level. A
		new two-stage procedure for hypothesis testing is proposed,
		where the first stage is conventional hypothesis testing and
		the second is an equivalence testing procedure using the
		introduced empirical equivalence bound. See Zhao et al. (2019)
		"B-Value and Empirical Equivalence Bound: A New Procedure of
		Hypothesis Testing" arXiv:1912.13084 for details.
