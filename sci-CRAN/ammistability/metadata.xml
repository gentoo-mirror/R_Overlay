		Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction Model
		Stability Parameters // Computes various stability parameters
		from Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction
		(AMMI) analysis results such as  Modified AMMI Stability Value
		(MASV), Sums of the Absolute Value of the Interaction Principal
		Component Scores (SIPC), Sum Across Environments of Genotype-
		Environment Interaction Modelled by AMMI (AMGE), Sum Across
		Environments of Absolute Value of Genotype-Environment
		Interaction Modelled by AMMI (AV_(AMGE)), AMMI Stability Index
		(ASI), Modified ASI (MASI), AMMI Based Stability Parameter
		(ASTAB), Annicchiarico's D Parameter (DA), Zhang's D Parameter
		(DZ), Averages of the Squared Eigenvector Values (EV),
		Stability Measure Based on Fitted AMMI Model (FA), Absolute
		Value of the Relative Contribution of IPCs to the Interaction
		(Za). Further calculates the Simultaneous Selection Index for
		Yield and Stability from the computed stability parameters. See
		the vignette for complete list of citations for the methods
		implemented.
