		Stability-enHanced Approaches using Resampling Procedures // In
		stability selection (N Meinshausen, P Bhlmann (2010)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00740.x), resampling techniques
		are used to enhance the reliability of the results. In this
		package, hyper-parameters are calibrated by maximising model
		stability, which is measured by the negative log-likelihood
		under the null hypothesis that all selection probabilities are
		identical (B Bodinier et al (2021) arXiv:2106.02521). Functions
		are readily implemented for the use of LASSO regression, sparse
		PCA, sparse (group) PLS or graphical LASSO.
