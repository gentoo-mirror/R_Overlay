		synthetic controls analyses performed by the package 'Synth' as
		detailed in Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2011) doi:
		10.18637/jss.v042.i13. Includes generating and plotting
		placebos, post/pre-MSPE (Mean Squared Prediction Error)
		significance tests and plots, and calculating average treatment
		effects for multiple treated units. This package represents an
		implementation of those methods suggested in Abadie,
