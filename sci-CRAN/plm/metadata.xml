		Linear Models for Panel Data // A set of estimators for models
		and (robust) covariance matrices, and tests for panel data
		econometrics, including within/fixed effects, random effects,
		between, first-difference, nested random effects as well as
		instrumental-variable (IV) and Hausman-Taylor-style models,
		panel generalized method of moments (GMM) and general FGLS
		models, mean groups (MG), demeaned MG, and common correlated
		effects (CCEMG) and pooled (CCEP) estimators with common
		factors, variable coefficients and limited dependent variables
		models. Test functions include model specification, serial
		correlation, cross-sectional dependence, panel unit root and
		panel Granger (non-)causality. Typical references are general
		econometrics text books such as Baltagi (2021), Econometric
		Analysis of Panel Data (doi:10.1007/978-3-030-53953-5), Hsiao
		(2014), Analysis of Panel Data (doi:10.1017/CBO9781139839327),
		and Croissant and Millo (2018), Panel Data Econometrics with R
		(doi:10.1002/9781119504641).
