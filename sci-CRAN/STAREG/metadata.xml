		An Empirical Bayes Approach for Replicability Analysis Across Two
		Studies // A robust and powerful empirical Bayesian approach is
		developed for replicability analysis of two large-scale
		experimental studies. The method controls the false discovery
		rate by using the joint local false discovery rate based on the
		replicability null as the test statistic. An EM algorithm
		combined with a shape constraint nonparametric method is used
		to estimate unknown parameters and functions. [Li, Y. et al.,
