		Crawler and Data Scraper for Open Journal System ('OJS') //
		Crawler for 'OJS' pages and scraper for meta-data from
		articles. You can crawl 'OJS' archives, issues, articles,
		galleys, and search results. You can scrape articles metadata
		from their head tag in html, or from Open Archives Initiative
		('OAI') records. Most of these functions rely on 'OJS' routing
		conventions
		(https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/architecture-
		routes).
