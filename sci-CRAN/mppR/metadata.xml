		Multi-Parent Population QTL Analysis // Analysis of experimental
		multi-parent populations to detect regions of the genome
		(called quantitative trait loci, QTLs) influencing phenotypic
		traits measured in unique and multiple environments. The
		population must be composed of crosses between a set of at
		least three parents (e.g. factorial design, 'diallel', or
		nested association mapping). The functions cover data
		processing, QTL detection, and results visualization. The
		implemented methodology is described in Garin, Wimmer, Mezmouk,
		Malosetti and van Eeuwijk (2017) doi:10.1007/s00122-017-2923-3,
		in Garin, Malosetti and van Eeuwijk (2020) doi:
		10.1007/s00122-020-03621-0, and in Garin, Diallo, Tekete,
		Thera, ..., and Rami (2024) doi: 10.1093/genetics/iyae003.
