		Model Based ROC Analysis // The ROC curve method is one of the
		most important and commonly used methods for model accuracy
		assessment, which is one of the most important elements of
		model evaluation. The 'modelROC' package is a model-based ROC
		assessment tool, which directly works for ROC analysis of
		regression results for logistic regression of binary variables,
		including the glm() and lrm() commands, and COX regression for
		survival analysis, including the cph() and coxph() commands.
		The most important feature of 'modelROC' is that both the model
		and the independent variables can be analysed simultaneously,
		and for survival analysis multiple time points and area under
		the curve analysis are supported. Still, flexible visualisation
		is possible with the 'ggplot2' package. Reference are Kelly H.
