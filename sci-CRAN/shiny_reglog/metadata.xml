		Optional Login and Registration Module System for ShinyApps //
		RegLog system provides a set of shiny modules to handle
		register procedure for your users, alongside with login, edit
		credentials and password reset functionality. It provides
		support for popular SQL databases and optionally googlesheet-
		based database for easy setup. For email sending it provides
		support for 'emayili' and 'gmailr' backends. Architecture makes
		customizing usability pretty straightforward. The
		authentication system created with shiny.reglog is designed to
		be optional: user don't need to be logged-in to access your
		application, but when logged-in the user data can be used to
		read from and write to relational databases.
