		Hyperbolic Geometry // Hyperbolic geometry in the Minkowski model
		and the Poincar model. The methods are based on the gyrovector
		space theory developed by A. A. Ungar that can be found in the
		book 'Analytic Hyperbolic Geometry: Mathematical Foundations
		And Applications' doi:10.1142/5914. The package provides
		functions to plot three-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra and to
		plot hyperbolic tilings of the Poincar disk.
