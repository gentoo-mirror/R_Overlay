		Estimating the Cluster Specific Treatment Effects in Partially
		Nested Designs // Implements the methods for assessing
		heterogeneous cluster-specific treatment effects in partially
		nested designs as described in Liu (2024)
		doi:10.1037/met0000723. The estimation uses the multiply robust
		method, allowing for the use of machine learning methods in
		model estimation (e.g., random forest, neural network, and the
		super learner ensemble).  Partially nested designs (also known
		as partially clustered designs) are designs where individuals
		in the treatment arm are assigned to clusters (e.g., teachers,
		tutoring groups, therapists), whereas individuals in the
		control arm have no such clustering.
