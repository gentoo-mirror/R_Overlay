		CRISPR-Based Salmonella Enterica Serotype Analyzer // Salmonella
		enterica is a major cause of bacterial food-borne disease
		worldwide. Serotype identification is the most commonly used
		typing method to characterize Salmonella isolates. However,
		experimental serotyping needs great cost on manpower and
		resources. Recently, we found that the newly incorporated
		spacer in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
		repeat (CRISPR) could serve as an effective marker for typing
		of Salmonella. It was further revealed by Li et. al (2014)
		doi:10.1128/JCM.00696-14 that recognized types based on the
		combination of two newly incorporated spacer in both CRISPR
		loci showed high accordance with serotypes. Here, we developed
		an R package 'CSESA' to predict the serotype based on this
		finding. Considering its time saving and of high accuracy, we
		recommend to predict the serotypes of unknown Salmonella
		isolates using 'CSESA' before doing the traditional serotyping.
