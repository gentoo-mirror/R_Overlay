		Age-Period-Cohort Analysis // Functions for age-period-cohort
		analysis. Aggregate data can be organised in matrices indexed
		by age-cohort, age-period or cohort-period. The data can
		include dose and response or just doses. The statistical model
		is a generalized linear model (GLM) allowing for 3,2,1 or 0 of
		the age-period-cohort factors. 2-sample analysis is possible.
		Mixed frequency data are possible. Individual-level data should
		have a row for each individual and columns for each of age,
		period, and cohort. The statistical model for repeated cross-
		section is a generalized linear model. The statistical model
		for panel data is ordinary least squares. The canonical
		parametrisation of Kuang, Nielsen and Nielsen (2008)
		DOI:10.1093/biomet/asn026 is used. Thus, the analysis does not
		rely on ad hoc identification.
