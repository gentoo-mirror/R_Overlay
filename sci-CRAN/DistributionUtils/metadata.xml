		Distribution Utilities // Utilities are provided which are of use
		in the packages I have developed for dealing with
		distributions. Currently these packages are
		GeneralizedHyperbolic, VarianceGamma, and SkewHyperbolic and
		NormalLaplace. Each of these packages requires
		DistributionUtils. Functionality includes sample skewness and
		kurtosis, log-histogram, tail plots, moments by integration,
		changing the point about which a moment is calculated,
		functions for testing distributions using inversion tests and
		the Massart inequality. Also includes an implementation of the
		incomplete Bessel K function.
