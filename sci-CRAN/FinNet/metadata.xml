		Quickly Build and Manipulate Financial Networks // Providing
		classes, methods, and functions to deal with financial
		networks. Users can easily store information about both
		physical and legal persons by using pre-made classes that are
		studied for integration with scraping packages such as 'rvest'
		and 'RSelenium'. Moreover, the package assists in creating
		various types of financial networks depending on the type of
		relation between its units depending on the relation under
		scrutiny (ownership, board interlocks, etc.), the desired tie
		type (valued or binary), and renders them in the most common
		formats (adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, edge list,
		'igraph', 'network').
