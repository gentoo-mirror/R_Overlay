		Multi-Purpose and Flexible k-Meric Enrichment Analysis Software
		// A multi-purpose and flexible k-meric enrichment analysis
		software. 'kmeRtone' measures the enrichment of k-mers by
		comparing the population of k-mers in the case loci with a
		carefully devised internal negative control group, consisting
		of k-mers from regions close to, yet sufficiently distant from,
		the case loci to mitigate any potential sequencing bias. This
		method effectively captures both the local sequencing
		variations and broader sequence influences, while also
		correcting for potential biases, thereby ensuring more accurate
		analysis. The core functionality of 'kmeRtone' is the SCORE()
		function, which calculates the susceptibility scores for k-mers
		in case and control regions. Case regions are defined by the
		genomic coordinates provided in a file by the user and the
		control regions can be constructed relative to the case regions
		or provided directly. The k-meric susceptibility scores are
		calculated by using a one-proportion z-statistic. 'kmeRtone' is
		highly flexible by allowing users to also specify their target
		k-mer patterns and quantify the corresponding k-mer enrichment
		scores in the context of these patterns, allowing for a more
		comprehensive approach to understanding the functional
		implications of specific DNA sequences on a genomic scale
		(e.g., CT motifs upon UV radiation damage). Adib A. Abdullah,
