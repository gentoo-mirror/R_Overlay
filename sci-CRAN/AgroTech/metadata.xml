		Data Analysis of Pesticide Application Technology // In total it
		has 7 functions, three for calculating machine calibration,
		which determine application rate (L/ha), nozzle flow (L/min)
		and amount of product (L or kg) to be added. to the tank with
		each sprayer filling. Two functions for graphs of the flow
		distribution of the nozzles (L/min) in the application bar and,
		of the temporal variability of the meteorological conditions
		(air temperature, relative humidity of the air and wind speed).
		Two functions to determine the spray deposit (uL/cm2), through
		the methodology called spectrophotometry, with the aid of
		bright blue (Palladini, L.A., Raetano, C.G., Velini, E.D.
		(2005), doi:10.1590/S0103-90162005000500005) or metallic
		markers (Chaim, A., Castro, V.L.S.S., Correles, F.M., Galvo,
		J.A.H., Cabral, O.M.R., Nicolella, G. (1999),
		doi:10.1590/S0100-204X1999000500003). The package supports the
		analysis and representation of information, using a single free
		software that meets the most diverse areas of activity in
		application technology.
