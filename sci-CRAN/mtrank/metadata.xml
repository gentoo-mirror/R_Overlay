		Ranking using Probabilistic Models and Treatment Choice Criteria
		// Implementation of a novel frequentist approach to produce
		clinically relevant treatment hierarchies in network meta-
		analysis. The method is based on treatment choice criteria
		(TCC) and probabilistic ranking models, as described by
		Evrenoglou et al. (2024) DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2406.10612. The TCC
		are defined using a rule based on the minimal clinically
		important difference. Using the defined TCC, the study-level
		data (i.e., treatment effects and standard errors) are first
		transformed into a preference format, indicating either a
		treatment preference (e.g., treatment A  treatment B) or a tie
		(treatment A = treatment B). The preference data are then
		synthesized using a probabilistic ranking model, which
		estimates the latent ability parameter of each treatment and
		produces the final treatment hierarchy. This parameter
		represents each treatments ability to outperform all the other
		competing treatments in the network. Consequently, larger
		ability estimates indicate higher positions in the ranking
		list.
