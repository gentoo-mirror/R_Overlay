		Ranking using Probabilistic Models and Treatment Choice Criteria
		// Estimation of treatment hierarchies in network meta-analysis
		using a novel frequentist approach based on treatment choice
		criteria (TCC) and probabilistic ranking models, as described
		by Evrenoglou et al. (2024) DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2406.10612. The
		TCC are defined using a rule based on the smallest worthwhile
		difference (SWD). Using the defined TCC, the NMA estimates
		(i.e., treatment effects and standard errors) are first
		transformed into treatment preferences, indicating either a
		treatment preference (e.g., treatment A  treatment B) or a tie
		(treatment A = treatment B). These treatment preferences are
		then synthesized using a probabilistic ranking model, which
		estimates the latent ability parameter of each treatment and
		produces the final treatment hierarchy. This parameter
		represents each treatments ability to outperform all the other
		competing treatments in the network. Here the terms ability to
		outperform indicates the propensity of each treatment to yield
		clinically important and beneficial effects when compared to
		all the other treatments in the network. Consequently, larger
		ability estimates indicate higher positions in the ranking
		list.
