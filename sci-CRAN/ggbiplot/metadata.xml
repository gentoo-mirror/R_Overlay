		A Grammar of Graphics Implementation of Biplots // A 'ggplot2'
		based implementation of biplots, giving a representation of a
		dataset in a two dimensional space accounting for the greatest
		variance, together with variable vectors showing how the data
		variables relate to this space. It provides a replacement for
		stats::biplot(), but with many enhancements to control the
		analysis and graphical display. It implements biplot and scree
		plot methods which can be used with the results of prcomp(),
		princomp(), FactoMineR::PCA() or MASS::lda() and can be
		customized using 'ggplot2' techniques.
