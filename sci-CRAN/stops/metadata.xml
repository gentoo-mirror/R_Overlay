		Structure Optimized Proximity Scaling // A collection of methods
		that fit nonlinear distance transformations in multidimensional
		scaling (MDS) and trade-off the fit with structure
		considerations to find optimal parameters also known as
		structure optimized proximity scaling (STOPS) (Rusch, Mair
		Hornik, 2023,doi:10.1007/s11222-022-10197-w). The package
		contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for
		fitting, plotting and displaying different MDS models in a
		STOPS framework like Torgerson (classical) scaling, scaling by
		majorizing a complex function (SMACOF), Sammon mapping, elastic
		scaling, symmetric SMACOF, spherical SMACOF, s-stress,
		r-stress, power MDS, power elastic scaling, power Sammon
		mapping, power stress MDS (POST-MDS), approximate power stress,
		Box-Cox MDS, local MDS and Isomap. All of these models can also
		be fit individually with given hyperparameters or by optimizing
		over hyperparameters based on fit only (i.e., no structure
		considerations). The package further contains functions for
		optimization, specifically the adaptive Luus-Jaakola algorithm
		and a wrapper for Bayesian optimization with treed Gaussian
		process with jumps to linear models, and functions for various
		c-structuredness indices.
