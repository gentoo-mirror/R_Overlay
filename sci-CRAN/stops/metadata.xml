		Structure Optimized Proximity Scaling // Methods that use
		flexible variants of multidimensional scaling (MDS) which
		incorporate parametric nonlinear distance transformations and
		trade-off the goodness-of-fit fit with structure considerations
		to find optimal hyperparameters, also known as structure
		optimized proximity scaling (STOPS) (Rusch, Mair  Hornik,
		2023,doi:10.1007/s11222-022-10197-w). The package contains
		various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting,
		plotting and displaying different 1-way MDS models with ratio,
		interval, ordinal optimal scaling in a STOPS framework. These
		cover essentially the functionality of the package smacofx,
		including Torgerson (classical) scaling with power
		transformations of dissimilarities, SMACOF MDS with powers of
		dissimilarities, Sammon mapping with powers of dissimilarities,
		elastic scaling with powers of dissimilarities, spherical
		SMACOF with powers of dissimilarities, (ALSCAL) s-stress MDS
		with powers of dissimilarities, r-stress MDS, MDS with powers
		of dissimilarities and configuration distances, elastic scaling
		powers of dissimilarities and configuration distances, Sammon
		mapping powers of dissimilarities and configuration distances,
		power stress MDS (POST-MDS), approximate power stress, Box-Cox
		MDS, local MDS, Isomap, curvilinear component analysis (CLCA),
		curvilinear distance analysis (CLDA) and sparsified (power)
		multidimensional scaling and (power) multidimensional distance
		analysis (experimental models from smacofx influenced by CLCA).
		All of these models can also be fit by optimizing over
		hyperparameters based on goodness-of-fit fit only (i.e., no
		structure considerations). The package further contains
		functions for optimization, specifically the adaptive Luus-
		Jaakola algorithm and a wrapper for Bayesian optimization with
		treed Gaussian process with jumps to linear models, and
		functions for various c-structuredness indices. Hyperparameter
		optimization can be done with a number of techniques but we
		recommend either Bayesian optimization or particle swarm. For
		using "Kriging", users need to install a version of the
		archived 'DiceOptim' R package.
