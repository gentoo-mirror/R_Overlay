		An Interface to the NOAA Operational Model Archive and
		Distribution System // An interface to the National Oceanic and
		Atmospheric Administration's Operational Model Archive and
		Distribution System (NOMADS, see http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/
		for more information) that allows R users to quickly and
		efficiently download global and regional weather model data for
		processing.  rNOMADS currently supports a variety of models
		ranging from global weather data to an altitude of 40 km, to
		high resolution regional weather models, to wave and sea ice
		models. It can also retrieve archived NOMADS models.  rNOMADS
		can retrieve binary data in grib format as well as import ascii
		data directly into R by interfacing with the GrADS-DODS system.
