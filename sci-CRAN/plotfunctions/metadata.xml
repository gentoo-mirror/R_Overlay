		Various Functions to Facilitate Visualization of Data and
		Analysis // When analyzing data, plots are a helpful tool for
		visualizing data and interpreting statistical models. This
		package provides a set of simple tools for building plots
		incrementally, starting with an empty plot region, and adding
		bars, data points, regression lines, error bars, gradient
		legends, density distributions in the margins, and even
		pictures. The package builds further on R graphics by simply
		combining functions and settings in order to reduce the amount
		of code to produce for the user. As a result, the package does
		not use formula input or special syntax, but can be used in
		combination with default R plot functions. Note: Most of the
		functions were part of the package 'itsadug', which is now
		split in two packages: 1. the package 'itsadug', which contains
		the core functions for visualizing and evaluating nonlinear
		regression models, and 2. the package 'plotfunctions', which
		contains more general plot functions.
