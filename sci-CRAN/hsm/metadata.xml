		A Path-Based BCD for Proximal Function of Latent Group Lasso //
		Implementation of the block coordinate descent procedure for
		solving the proximal function of latent group Lasso,
		highlighted by decomposing a DAG into several non-overlapping
		path graphs, and getting closed-form solution for each path
		graph. The procedure was introduced as Algorithm 4 in Yan and
		Bien (2017) doi:10.1214/17-STS622 "Hierarchical Sparse
		Modeling: A Choice of Two Group Lasso Formulations", and the
		closed-form solution for each path graph is solved in Algorithm
		3 of that paper.
