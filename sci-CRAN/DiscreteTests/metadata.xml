		Vectorised Computation of P-Values and Their Supports for Several
		Discrete Statistical Tests // Provides vectorised functions for
		computing p-values of various common discrete statistical
		tests, as described e.g. in Agresti (2002)
		doi:10.1002/0471249688, including their distributions. Exact
		and approximate computation methods are provided. For exact
		p-values, several procedures of determining two-sided p-values
		are included, which are outlined in more detail in Hirji (2006)
		doi:10.1201/9781420036190.
