		Fitting of Complementary Risk Models // Evaluates the probability
		density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF),
		quantile function (QF), random numbers and maximum likelihood
		estimates (MLEs) of well-known complementary binomial-G,
		complementary negative binomial-G and complementary geometric-G
		families of distributions taking baseline models such as
		exponential, extended exponential,  Weibull,  extended Weibull,
		Fisk, Lomax, Burr-XII and Burr-X. The functions also allow
		computing the goodness-of-fit measures namely the Akaike-
		information-criterion (AIC), the Bayesian-information-criterion
		(BIC), the minimum value of the negative log-likelihood (-2L)
		function, Anderson-Darling (A) test, Cramer-Von-Mises (W) test,
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P-value and convergence status.
		Moreover, some commonly used data sets from the fields of
		actuarial, reliability, and medical science are also provided.
