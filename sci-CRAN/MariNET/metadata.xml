		Build Network Based on Linear Mixed Models from EHRs // Analyzing
		longitudinal clinical data from Electronic Health Records
		(EHRs) using linear mixed models (LMM) and visualizing the
		results as networks. It includes functions for fitting LMM,
		normalizing adjacency matrices, and comparing networks. The
		package is designed for researchers in clinical and biomedical
		fields who need to model longitudinal data and explore
		relationships between variables For more details see Bates et
		al. (2015) doi:10.18637/jss.v067.i01.
