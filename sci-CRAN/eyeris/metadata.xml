		Flexible, Extensible,  Reproducible Pupillometry Preprocessing //
		Pupillometry offers a non-invasive window into the mind and has
		been used extensively as a psychophysiological readout of
		arousal signals linked with cognitive processes like attention,
		stress, and emotional states [Clewett et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17851-9; Kret  Sjak-Shie (2018)
		doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1075-y; Strauch (2024)
		doi:10.1016/j.tins.2024.06.002]. Yet, despite decades of
		pupillometry research, many established packages and workflows
		to date lack design patterns based on Findability,
		Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR)
		principles [see Wilkinson et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18]. 'eyeris' provides a modular,
		performant, and extensible preprocessing framework for
		pupillometry data with BIDS-like organization and interactive
		output reports [Esteban et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4; Gorgolewski et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.44]. Development was supported, in part,
		by the Stanford Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance, Stanford
		Ric Weiland Graduate Fellowship, Stanford Center for Mind,
		Brain, Computation and Technology, NIH National Institute on
		Aging Grants (R01-AG065255, R01-AG079345), NSF GRFP
		(DGE-2146755), McKnight Brain Research Foundation Clinical
		Translational Research Scholarship in Cognitive Aging and Age-
		Related Memory Loss, American Brain Foundation, and the
		American Academy of Neurology.
