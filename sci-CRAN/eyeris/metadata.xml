		Flexible, Extensible,  Reproducible Pupillometry Preprocessing //
		Pupillometry offers a non-invasive window into the mind and has
		been used extensively as a psychophysiological readout of
		arousal signals linked with cognitive processes like attention,
		stress, and emotional states [Clewett et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17851-9; Kret  Sjak-Shie (2018)
		doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1075-y; Strauch (2024)
		doi:10.1016/j.tins.2024.06.002]. Yet, despite decades of
		pupillometry research, many established packages and workflows
		to date unfortunately lack design patterns based on
		Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability
		(FAIR) principles [see Wilkinson et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18]. 'eyeris', on the other hand,
		follows a design philosophy that provides users with an
		intuitive, modular, performant, and extensible pupillometry
		data preprocessing framework out-of-the-box. 'eyeris'
		introduces a Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)-like
		organization for derivative (i.e., preprocessed) pupillometry
		data as well as an intuitive workflow for inspecting
		preprocessed pupil epochs using interactive output report files
		[Esteban et al. (2019) doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4;
		Gorgolewski et al. (2016) doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.44].
