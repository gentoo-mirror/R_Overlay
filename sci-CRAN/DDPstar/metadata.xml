		Density Regression via Dirichlet Process Mixtures of Normal
		Structured Additive Regression Models // Implements a flexible,
		versatile, and computationally tractable model for density
		regression based on a single-weights dependent Dirichlet
		process mixture of normal distributions model for univariate
		continuous responses. The model assumes an additive structure
		for the mean of each mixture component and the effects of
		continuous covariates are captured through smooth nonlinear
		functions. The key components of our modelling approach are
		penalised B-splines and their bivariate tensor product
		extension. The proposed method can also easily deal with
		parametric effects of categorical covariates, linear effects of
		continuous covariates, interactions between categorical and/or
		continuous covariates, varying coefficient terms, and random
		effects. Please see Rodriguez-Alvarez, Inacio et al. (2025) for
		more details.
