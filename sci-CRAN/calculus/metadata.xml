		High Dimensional Numerical and Symbolic Calculus // Efficient C++
		optimized functions for numerical and symbolic calculus. It
		includes basic symbolic arithmetic, tensor calculus, Einstein
		summing convention, fast computation of the Levi-Civita symbol
		and generalized Kronecker delta, Taylor series expansion,
		multivariate Hermite polynomials, accurate high-order
		derivatives, differential operators (Gradient, Jacobian,
		Hessian, Divergence, Curl, Laplacian) and numerical integration
		in arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems: cartesian, polar,
		spherical, cylindrical, parabolic or user defined by custom
		scale factors.
