		Given a List of Gene Symbols, Performs Differential Enrichment
		Analysis // Compare functional enrichment between two
		experimentally-derived groups of genes or proteins (Peterson,
		DR., et al.(2018)) doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198139. Given a
		list of gene symbols, 'diffEnrich'  will perform differential
		enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
		Genomes (KEGG) REST API. This package provides a number of
		functions that are intended to be used in a pipeline. Briefly,
		the user provides a KEGG formatted species id for either human,
		mouse or rat, and the package will download and clean species
		specific ENTREZ gene IDs and map them to their respective KEGG
		pathways by accessing KEGG's REST API. KEGG's API is used to
		guarantee the most up-to-date pathway data from KEGG. Next, the
		user will identify significantly enriched pathways from two
		gene sets, and finally, the user will identify pathways that
		are differentially enriched between the two gene sets. In
		addition to the analysis pipeline, this package also provides a
		plotting function.
