		Fitting RT-MPT Models // Fit response-time extended multinomial
		processing tree (RT-MPT) models by Klauer and Kellen (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2017.12.003. The RT-MPT class not only
		incorporate frequencies like traditional multinomial processing
		tree (MPT) models, but also latencies. This enables it to
		estimate process completion times and encoding plus motor
		execution times next to the process probabilities of
		traditional MPTs. 'rtmpt' is a Bayesian framework and posterior
		samples are sampled using a Metropolis-Gibbs sampler like the
		one described in the Klauer and Kellen (2018), but with some
		modifications. Other than in the original C++ program we use
		the free and open source GNU Scientific Library (GSL). There is
		also the possibility to suppress single process completion
		times.
