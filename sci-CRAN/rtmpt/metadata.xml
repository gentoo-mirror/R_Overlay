		Fitting (Exponential/Diffusion) RT-MPT Models // Fit (exponential
		or diffusion) response-time extended multinomial processing
		tree (RT-MPT) models by Klauer and        Kellen (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2017.12.003 and Klauer, Hartmann, and Meyer-
		Grant (submitted). The RT-MPT class not only incorporate
		frequencies like traditional multinomial processing tree (MPT)
		models, but also latencies. This enables it      to estimate
		process completion times and encoding plus motor execution
		times next to the process probabilities  of traditional MPTs.
		'rtmpt' is a hierarchical Bayesian framework and posterior
		samples are sampled using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler
		(for exponential RT-MPTs) or Hamiltonian-within-Gibbs sampler
		(for diffusion RT-MPTs).
