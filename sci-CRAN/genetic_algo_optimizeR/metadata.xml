		Genetic Algorithm Optimization // Genetic algorithm are a class
		of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural
		selection and genetics. This package is for learning purposes
		and allows users to optimize various functions or parameters by
		mimicking biological evolution processes such as selection,
		crossover, and mutation. Ideal for tasks like machine learning
		parameter tuning, mathematical function optimization, and
		solving combinatorial problems.
