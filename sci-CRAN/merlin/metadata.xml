		Mixed Effects Regression for Linear, Non-Linear and User-Defined
		Models // Fits linear, non-linear, and user-defined mixed
		effects regression models following the framework developed by
		Crowther (2017) arXiv:1710.02223. 'merlin' can fit multivariate
		outcome models of any type, each of which could be repeatedly
		measured (longitudinal), with any number of levels, and with
		any number of random effects at each level. Standard
		distributions/models available include the Bernoulli, Gaussian,
		Poisson, beta, negative-binomial, and time-to-event/survival
		models include the exponential, Gompertz, Royston-Parmar,
		Weibull and general hazard model. 'merlin' provides a flexible
		predictor syntax, allowing the user to define variables, random
		effects, spline and fractional polynomial functions, functions
		of other outcome models, and any interaction between each of
		them. Non-linear and time-dependent effects are seamlessly
		incorporated into the predictor. 'merlin' allows multivariate
		normal random effects, which are integrated out using Gaussian
		quadrature or Monte-Carlo integration. Note, 'merlin' is based
		on the 'Stata' package of the same name, described in Crowther
		(2018) arXiv:1806.01615.
