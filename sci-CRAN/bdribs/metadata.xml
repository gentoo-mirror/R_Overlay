		Bayesian Detection of Potential Risk Using Inference on Blinded
		Safety Data // Implements Bayesian inference to detect signal
		from blinded clinical trial when total number of adverse events
		of special concerns and total risk exposures from all patients
		are available in the study. For more details see the article by
		Mukhopadhyay et. al. (2018) titled 'Bayesian Detection of
		Potential Risk Using Inference on Blinded Safety Data', in
		Pharmaceutical Statistics (to appear).
