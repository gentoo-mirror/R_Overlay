		(Sequential) Quadratic Programming // Solving procedures for
		quadratic programming with optional equality and inequality
		constraints, which can be used for by sequential quadratic
		programming (SQP). Similar to Newton-Raphson methods in the
		unconstrained case, sequential quadratic programming solves
		non-linear constrained optimization problems by iteratively
		solving linear approximations of the optimality conditions of
		such a problem (cf. Powell (1978) doi:10.1007/BFb0067703;
		Nocedal and Wright (1999, ISBN: 978-0-387-98793-4)). The
		Hessian matrix in this strategy is commonly approximated by the
		BFGS method in its damped modification proposed by Powell
		(1978) doi:10.1007/BFb0067703. All methods are implemented in
		C++ as header-only library, such that it is easy to use in
		other packages.
