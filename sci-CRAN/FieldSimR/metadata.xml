		Simulation of Plot Errors and Phenotypes in Plant Breeding Field
		Trials // Simulates plot data in multi-environment field trials
		with one or more traits. Its core function generates plot
		errors that capture spatial trend, random error (noise), and
		extraneous variation, which are combined at a user-defined
		ratio. Phenotypes can be generated by combining the plot errors
		with simulated genetic values that capture genotype-by-
		environment (GxE) interaction using wrapper functions for the R
		package `AlphaSimR`.
