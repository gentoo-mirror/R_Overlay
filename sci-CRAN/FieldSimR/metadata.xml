		Simulation of Plot Errors and Phenotypes in Plant Breeding Field
		Trials // Simulates plot data in field trials for multiple
		traits across multiple environments. Its core function
		generates plot errors comprising 1) a spatially correlated
		error term, 2) a random error term, and 3) an extraneous error
		term. Spatially correlated errors are simulated using either
		bivariate interpolation or a two-dimensional autoregressive
		process of order one (AR1:AR1). The three error terms are
		combined at a user-defined ratio. Plot phenotypes can be
		generated by combining the simulated errors with genetic values
		(e.g. true, simulated or predicted). 'FieldSimR' provides
		wrapper functions to simulate genetic values for multiple
		traits across multiple environments using the 'R' package
		'AlphaSimR'.
