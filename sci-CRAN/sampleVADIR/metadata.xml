		Draw Stratified Samples from the VADIR Database // Affords
		researchers the ability to draw stratified samples from the
		U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs/Department of Defense
		Identity Repository (VADIR) database according to a variety of
		population characteristics. The VADIR database contains
		information for all veterans who were separated from the
		military after 1980. The central utility of the present package
		is to integrate data cleaning and formatting for the VADIR
		database with the stratification methods described by Mahto
		(2019) https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=splitstackshape. Data
		from VADIR are not provided as part of this package.
