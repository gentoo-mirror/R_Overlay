		Graph-Based Sequential Change-Point Detection for Streaming Data
		// Uses an approach based on k-nearest neighbor information to
		sequentially detect change-points. Offers analytic
		approximations for false discovery control given user-specified
		average run length.  Can be applied to any type of data (high-
		dimensional, non-Euclidean, etc.) as long as a reasonable
		similarity measure is available.
