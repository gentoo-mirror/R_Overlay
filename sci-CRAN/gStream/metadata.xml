		Graph-Based Sequential Change-Point Detection for Streaming Data
		// Uses an approach based on k-nearest neighbor information to
		sequentially detect change-points. Offers analytic
		approximations for false discovery control given user-specified
		average run length.  Can be applied to any type of data (high-
		dimensional, non-Euclidean, etc.) as long as a reasonable
		similarity measure is available.  See references (1) Chen, H.
		(2019) Sequential change-point detection based on nearest
		neighbors. The Annals of Statistics, 47(3):1381-1407. (2) Chu,
		L. and Chen, H. (2018) Sequential change-point detection for
		high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data arXiv:1810.05973.
