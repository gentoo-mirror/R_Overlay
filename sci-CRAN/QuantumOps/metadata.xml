		Performs Common Linear Algebra Operations Used in Quantum
		Computing // Contains basic structures and operations used
		frequently in quantum computing. Intended to be a convenient
		tool to help in practicing the linear algebra involved in
		quantum operations. Has functionality for the creation of
		arbitrarily sized kets, bras, matrices and implements quantum
		gates, inner products, and tensor products. Contains all
		commonly used quantum gates, creates arbitrarily controlled
		versions of all gates, and can simulate complete or partial
		measurements of kets. Can simulate the Quantum Fourier
		Transform developed by Shor (1999) and implements Shor's
		algorithm, factoring numbers up to 21. Implements modular
		arithmetic commonly found in quantum algorithms and can convert
		functions into equivalent quantum gates. Simulates the training
		of a quantum neural network developed by Schuld (2018) which
		can classify the MNIST dataset.
