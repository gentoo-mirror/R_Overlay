		Performs Common Linear Algebra Operations Used in Quantum
		Computing and Implements Quantum Algorithms // Contains basic
		structures and operations used frequently in quantum computing.
		Intended to be a convenient tool to help learn quantum
		mechanics and algorithms. Can create arbitrarily sized kets and
		bras and implements quantum gates, inner products, and tensor
		products. Creates arbitrarily controlled versions of all gates
		and can simulate complete or partial measurements of kets. Has
		functionality to convert functions into equivalent quantum
		gates and model quantum noise. Includes larger applications,
		such as Steane error correction DOI:10.1103/physrevlett.77.793,
		Quantum Fourier Transform and Shor's algorithm (Shor 1999),
		Grover's algorithm (1996), Quantum Approximation Optimization
		Algorithm (QAOA) (Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann 2014)
		arXiv:1411.4028, and a variational quantum classifier (Schuld
		2018) arXiv:1804.00633.
