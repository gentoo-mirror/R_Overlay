		Performs Common Linear Algebra Operations Used in Quantum
		Computing // Contains basic structures and operations used
		frequently in quantum computing. Intended to be a convenient
		tool to help in practicing the linear algebra involved in
		quantum operations. Has functionality for the creation of
		arbitrarily sized kets, bras, matrices and implements quantum
		gates, inner products, and tensor products. Contains all
		commonly used quantum gates and the Quantum Fourier Transform
		developed by Shor (1999). Implements modular arithmetic
		commonly found in quantum algorithms and can convert functions
		into equivalent quantum gates.
