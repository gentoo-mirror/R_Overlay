		Performs Common Linear Algebra Operations Used in Quantum
		Computing and Implements Quantum Algorithms // Contains basic
		structures and operations used frequently in quantum computing.
		Intended to be a convenient tool to help in practicing the
		linear algebra involved in quantum operations. Has
		functionality for the creation of arbitrarily sized kets, bras,
		matrices and implements quantum gates, inner products, and
		tensor products. Contains all commonly used quantum gates,
		creates arbitrarily controlled versions of all gates, and can
		simulate complete or partial measurements of kets. Implements
		modular arithmetic commonly found in quantum algorithms and can
		convert functions into equivalent quantum gates. It can also
		simulate larger applications, including Steane error correction
		DOI:10.1103/physrevlett.77.793, the Quantum Fourier Transform
		developed by Shor (1999), Shor's algorithm which factors
		numbers up to 21, Grover's algorithm (1996), the Quantum
		Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) (Farhi, Goldstone,
		and Gutmann 2014) arXiv:1411.4028, and the training of a
		quantum neural network developed by Schuld (2018)
		arXiv:1804.00633 which can classify the MNIST dataset.
