		Data Structures for Brain Imaging Data // A collection of data
		structures and methods for handling volumetric brain imaging
		data, with a focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging
		(fMRI). Provides efficient representations for three-
		dimensional and four-dimensional neuroimaging data through
		sparse and dense array implementations, memory-mapped file
		access for large datasets, and spatial transformation
		capabilities. Implements methods for image resampling, spatial
		filtering, region of interest analysis, and connected component
		labeling. General introduction to fMRI analysis can be found in
		Poldrack et al. (2024, "Handbook of functional MRI data
		analysis", ISBN:9781108795760).
