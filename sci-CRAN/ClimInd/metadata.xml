		Climate Indices // Computes 138 standard climate indices at
		monthly, seasonal and annual resolution. These indices were
		selected, based on their direct and significant impacts on
		target sectors, after a thorough review of the literature in
		the field of extreme weather events and natural hazards.
		Overall, the selected indices characterize different aspects of
		the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events, and
		are derived from a broad set of climatic variables, including
		surface air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind
		speed, cloudiness, solar radiation, and snow cover. The 138
		indices have been classified as follow: Temperature based
		indices (42), Precipitation based indices (22), Bioclimatic
		indices (21), Wind-based indices (5), Aridity/ continentality
		indices (10), Snow-based indices (13), Cloud/radiation based
		indices (6), Drought indices (8), Fire indices (5), Tourism
		indices (5).
