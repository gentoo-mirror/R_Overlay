		Model Builders for 'ggdmc' Package // A suite of tools for
		specifying and examining experimental designs related to choice
		response time models (e.g., the Diffusion Decision Model). This
		package allows users to define how experimental factors
		influence one or more model parameters using R-style formula
		syntax, while also checking the logical consistency of these
		associations. Additionally, it integrates with the 'ggdmc'
		package, which employs Differential Evolution Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) sampling to optimise model parameters.
		For further details on the model-building approach, see
		Heathcote, Lin, Reynolds, Strickland, Gretton, and Matzke
		(2019) doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1067-y.
