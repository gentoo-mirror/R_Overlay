		Graph Neural Network-Based Framework for Single Cell Active
		Pathways and Gene Modules Analysis // It is a single cell
		active pathway analysis tool based on the graph neural network
		(F. Scarselli (2009) doi:10.1109/TNN.2008.2005605; Thomas N.
		Kipf (2017) arXiv:1609.02907v4) to construct the gene-cell
		association network, infer pathway activity scores from
		different single cell modalities data, integrate multiple
		modality data on the same cells into one pathway activity score
		matrix, identify cell phenotype activated gene modules and
		parse association networks of gene modules under multiple cell
		phenotype. In addition, abundant visualization programs are
		provided to display the results.
