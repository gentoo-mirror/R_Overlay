		Explore Phylogenetic Signals Using Distance-Based Methods // A
		unified method, called M statistic, is provided for detecting
		phylogenetic signals in continuous traits, discrete traits, and
		multi-trait combinations. Blomberg and Garland (2002)
		doi:10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00472.x provided a widely accepted
		statistical definition of the phylogenetic signal, which is the
		"tendency for related species to resemble each other more than
		they resemble species drawn at random from the tree". The M
		statistic strictly adheres to the definition of phylogenetic
		signal, formulating an index and developing a method of testing
		in strict accordance with the definition, instead of relying on
		correlation analysis or evolutionary models. The novel method
		equivalently expressed the textual definition of the
		phylogenetic signal as an inequality equation of the
		phylogenetic and trait distances and constructed the M
		statistic. Also, there are more distance-based methods under
		development.
