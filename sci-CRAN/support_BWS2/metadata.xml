		Tools for Case 2 Best-Worst Scaling // Provides three basic
		functions that support an implementation of Case 2 (profile
		case) best-worst scaling. The first is to convert an orthogonal
		main-effect design into questions, the second is to create a
		dataset suitable for analysis, and the third is to calculate
		count-based scores. For details, see Aizaki and Fogarty (2019)
