		Quality Control of Sequencing Data // 'FASTQC' is the most widely
		used tool for evaluating the quality of high throughput
		sequencing data. It produces, for each sample, an html report
		and a compressed file containing the raw data. If you have
		hundreds of samples, you are not going to open up each 'HTML'
		page. You need some way of looking at these data in aggregate.
		'fastqcr' Provides helper functions to easily parse, aggregate
		and analyze 'FastQC' reports for large numbers of samples. It
		provides a convenient solution for building a 'Multi-QC'
		report, as well as, a 'one-sample' report with result
		interpretations.
