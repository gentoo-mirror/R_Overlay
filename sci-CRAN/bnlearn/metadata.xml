		Bayesian Network Structure Learning, Parameter Learning and
		Inference // Bayesian network structure learning, parameter
		learning and inference. This package implements constraint-
		based (PC, GS, IAMB, Inter-IAMB, Fast-IAMB, MMPC, Hiton-PC,
		HPC), pairwise (ARACNE and Chow-Liu), score-based (Hill-
		Climbing and Tabu Search) and hybrid (MMHC, RSMAX2, H2PC)
		structure learning algorithms for discrete, Gaussian and
		conditional Gaussian networks, along with many score functions
		and conditional independence tests. The Naive Bayes and the
		Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifiers are also
		implemented. Some utility functions (model comparison and
		manipulation, random data generation, arc orientation testing,
		simple and advanced plots) are included, as well as support for
		parameter estimation (maximum likelihood and Bayesian) and
		inference, conditional probability queries, cross-validation,
		bootstrap and model averaging. Development snapshots with the
		latest bugfixes are available from http://www.bnlearn.com.
