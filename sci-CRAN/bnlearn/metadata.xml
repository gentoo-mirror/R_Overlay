		Bayesian Network Structure Learning, Parameter Learning and
		Inference // Bayesian network structure learning, parameter
		learning and inference. This package implements constraint-
		based (PC, GS, IAMB, Inter-IAMB, Fast-IAMB, MMPC, Hiton-PC),
		pairwise (ARACNE and Chow-Liu), score-based (Hill-Climbing and
		Tabu Search) and hybrid (MMHC and RSMAX2) structure learning
		algorithms for discrete, Gaussian and conditional Gaussian
		networks, along with many score functions and conditional
		independence tests. The Naive Bayes and the Tree-Augmented
		Naive Bayes (TAN) classifiers are also implemented. Some
		utility functions (model comparison and manipulation, random
		data generation, arc orientation testing, simple and advanced
		plots) are included, as well as support for parameter
		estimation (maximum likelihood and Bayesian) and inference,
		conditional probability queries and cross-validation.
		Development snapshots with the latest bugfixes are available
		from http://www.bnlearn.com.
