		Create and Explore Geographic Zoning Systems // Functions,
		documentation and example data to help divide geographic space
		into discrete polygons (zones). The package supports new zoning
		systems that are documented in the accompanying paper,
		"ClockBoard: A zoning system for urban analysis", by Lovelace
		et al. (2022) doi:10.5311/JOSIS.2022.24.172. The functions are
		motivated by research into the merits of different zoning
		systems (Openshaw, 1977) doi:10.1068/a090169. A flexible
		ClockBoard zoning system is provided, which breaks-up space by
		concentric rings and radial lines emanating from a central
		point. By default, the diameter of the rings grow according to
		the triangular number sequence (Ross  Knott, 2019)
		doi:10.1080/26375451.2019.1598687 with the first 4 doughnuts
		(or annuli) measuring 1, 3, 6, and 10 km wide. These annuli are
		subdivided into equal segments (12 by default), creating the
		visual impression of a dartboard. Zones are labelled according
		to distance to the centre and angular distance from North,
		creating a simple geographic zoning and labelling system useful
		for visualising geographic phenomena with a clearly demarcated
		central location such as cities.
