		Detecting Influence Paths with Information Theory // Traces
		information spread through interactions between features,
		utilising information theory measures and a higher-order
		generalisation of the concept of widest paths in graphs. In
		particular, 'vistla' can be used to better understand the
		results of high-throughput biomedical experiments, by
		organising the effects of the investigated intervention in a
		tree-like hierarchy from direct to indirect ones, following the
		plausible information relay circuits. Due to its higher-order
		nature, 'vistla' can handle multi-modality and assign multiple
		roles to a single feature.
