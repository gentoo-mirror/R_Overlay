		Optimal Exact Tests for Multiple Binary Endpoints // Calculates
		exact hypothesis tests to compare a treatment and a reference
		group with respect to multiple binary endpoints. The tested
		null hypothesis is an identical multidimensional distribution
		of successes and failures in both groups. The alternative
		hypothesis is a larger success proportion in the treatment
		group in at least one endpoint. The tests are based on the
		multivariate permutation distribution of subjects between the
		two groups. For this permutation distribution, rejection
		regions are calculated that satisfy one of different possible
		optimization criteria. In particular, regions with maximal
		exhaustion of the nominal significance level, maximal power
		under a specified alternative or maximal number of elements can
		be found. Optimization is achieved by a branch-and-bound
		algorithm. By application of the closed testing principle, the
		global hypothesis tests are extended to multiple testing
		procedures.
