		Separate a Data Frame by Normalization // Separate a data frame
		in two based on key columns. The function unjoin() provides an
		inside-out version of a nested data frame. This is used to
		identify duplication and normalize it (in the database sense)
		by linking two tables with the redundancy removed. This is a
		basic requirement for detecting topology within spatial
		structures that has motivated the need for this package as a
		building block for workflows within more applied projects.
