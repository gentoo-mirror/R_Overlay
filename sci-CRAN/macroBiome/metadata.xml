		A Tool for Mapping the Distribution of the Biomes and Bioclimate
		// Procedures for simulating biomes by equilibrium vegetation
		models, with a special focus on paleoenvironmental
		applications. Two widely used equilibrium biome models are
		currently implemented in the package: the Holdridge Life Zone
		(HLZ) system (Holdridge 1947, doi:10.1126/science.105.2727.367)
		and the BIOME model (Prentice et al. 1992,
		doi:10.2307/2845499). Three climatic forest-steppe models are
		also implemented. An approach for estimating monthly time
		series of relative sunshine duration from temperature and
		precipitation data (Yin 1999, doi:10.1007/s007040050111) is
		also adapted, allowing process-based biome models to be
		combined with high-resolution paleoclimate simulation datasets
		(e.g., CHELSA-TraCE21k v1.0 dataset: https://chelsa-
		climate.org/chelsa-trace21k/).
