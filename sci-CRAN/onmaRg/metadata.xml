		Import Public Health Ontario's Ontario Marginalization Index //
		The Ontario Marginalization Index is a socioeconomic model that
		is built on Statistics Canada census data. The model consists
		of four dimensions: Residential Instability, Material
		Deprivation, Dependency and Ethnic Concentration. Each of these
		dimensions are imported for a variety of geographic levels (DA,
		CD, etc.) for both the 2011 and 2016 administrations of the
		census (2021 pending). These data sets contribute to community
		analysis of equity with respect to Ontario's Anti-Racism Act.
		The Ontario Marginalization Index data is retrieved from the
		Public Health Ontario website:
		https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/data-and-analysis/health-
		equity/ontario-marginalization-index. The shapefile data is
		retrieved from the Statistics Canada website:
		https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-
		limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm.
