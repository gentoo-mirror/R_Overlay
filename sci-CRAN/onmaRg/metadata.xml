		Import Public Health Ontario's Ontario Marginalization Index //
		The Ontario Marginalization Index is a socioeconomic model that
		is built on Statistics Canada census data. The model consists
		of four dimensions: In 2021, these dimensions were updated to
		"Material Resources" (previously called "Material
		Deprivation"), "Households and Dwellings" (previously called
		"Residential Instability"), "Age and Labour Force" (previously
		called "Dependency"), and "Racialized and Newcomer Populations"
		(previously called "Ethnic Concentration"). This update
		reflects a movement away from deficit-based language. 2021 data
		will load with these new dimension names, wheras 2011 and 2016
		data will load with the historical dimension names. Each of
		these dimensions are imported for a variety of geographic
		levels (DA, CD, etc.) for the 2021, 2011 and 2016
		administrations of the census. These data sets contribute to
		community analysis of equity with respect to Ontario's Anti-
		Racism Act. The Ontario Marginalization Index data is retrieved
		from the Public Health Ontario website:
		https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/data-and-analysis/health-
		equity/ontario-marginalization-index. The shapefile data is
		retrieved from the Statistics Canada website:
		https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-
		limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm.
