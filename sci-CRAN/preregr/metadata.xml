		Specify (Pre)Registrations and Export Them Human- And Machine-
		Readably // Preregistrations, or more generally, registrations,
		enable explicit timestamped and (often but not necessarily
		publicly) frozen documentation of plans and expectations as
		well as decisions and justifications. In research,
		preregistrations are commonly used to clearly document plans
		and facilitate justifications of deviations from those plans,
		as well as decreasing the effects of publication bias by
		enabling identification of research that was conducted but not
		published. Like reporting guidelines, (pre)registration forms
		often have specific structures that facilitate systematic
		reporting of important items. The 'preregr' package facilitates
		specifying (pre)registrations in R and exporting them to a
		human-readable format (using R Markdown partials or exporting
		to an 'HTML' file) as well as human-readable embedded data
		(using 'JSON'), as well as importing such exported
		(pre)registration specifications from such embedded 'JSON'.
