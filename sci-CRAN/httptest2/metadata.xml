		Test Helpers for 'httr2' // Testing and documenting code that
		communicates with remote servers can be painful. This package
		helps with writing tests for packages that use 'httr2'. It
		enables testing all of the logic on the R sides of the API
		without requiring access to the remote service, and it also
		allows recording real API responses to use as test fixtures.
		The ability to save responses and load them offline also
		enables writing vignettes and other dynamic documents that can
		be distributed without access to a live server.
