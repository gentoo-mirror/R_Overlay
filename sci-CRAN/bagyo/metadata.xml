		Philippine Tropical Cyclones Data // The Philippines frequently
		experiences tropical cyclones (called 'bagyo' in the Filipino
		language) because of its geographical position. These cyclones
		typically bring heavy rainfall, leading to widespread flooding,
		as well as strong winds that cause significant damage to human
		life, crops, and property. Data on cyclones are collected and
		curated by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and
		Astronomical Services Administration or 'PAGASA' and made
		available through its website
		https://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/tropical-
		cyclone/publications/annual-report. This package contains
		Philippine tropical cyclones data in a machine-readable format.
		It is hoped that this data package provides an interesting and
		unique dataset for data exploration and visualisation.
