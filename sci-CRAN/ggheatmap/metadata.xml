		Plot Heatmap // The flexibility and excellence of 'ggplot2' is
		unquestionable, so many drawing tools basically need 'ggplot2'
		as the operating object. In order to develop a heatmap drawing
		system based on ggplot2, we developed this tool, mainly to
		solve the heatmap puzzle problem and the flexible connection
		between the heatmap and the 'ggplot2' object. The advantages of
		this tool are as follows: 1. More flexible label settings; 2.
		Realize the linkage of heatmap and 'ggplot2' drawing system,
		which is helpful for operations such as puzzles; 3. Simple and
		easy to operate; 4. Optimization of clustering tree
		visualization.
