		Scalable Bayesian Disease Mapping Models for High-Dimensional
		Data // Implements several spatial and spatio-temporal scalable
		disease mapping models for high-dimensional count data using
		the INLA technique for approximate Bayesian inference in latent
		Gaussian models (Orozco-Acosta et al., 2021
		doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2021.100496; Orozco-Acosta et al., 2022
		arXiv:2201.08323 and Vicente et al., 2022 arXiv:2210.14849).
		The creation and develpment of this package has been supported
