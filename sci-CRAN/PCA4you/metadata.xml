		PCA Plotting in a User Friendly Way // A central part of using
		PCA and similar methods are creating and using plots. Visual
		inspection of these plots is an extremely powerful way of
		understanding your matrix-form data. Doing this is essential
		when applying multivariate methods on real-life matrix data.
		This package provides plots, tailor made for understanding a
		PCA model on a matrix dataset. We have worked to design plots
		that supports the mathematical properties of PCA, but still
		easy to use and understand. The flexibility of the plotting
		capacity of R has been utilized to create a look and feel that
		supports the understanding of the PCA model. In addition to
		that, this package contains a prediction function, using PCA to
		fill "holes" in a matrix. This package does not provide you
		with the scores and loadings etc in numeric form. This is
		provided through the underlying package 'mixOmics' which is the
		basis of this package. In addition, applied PCA on real life
		data requires flexibility. The original way of calculating a
		PCA is by using the method SVD, used in e.g. 'stats' package.
		This is preferred from a precision point of view. But 'PCA4you'
		is based on the method NIPALS for calculating the PCA model.
		Hence, the following cases, which are not (or poorly) supported
		by SVD, are fully supported by 'PCA4you':  1) Non complete
		matrices with little or a lot of missing values 2) More row
		than columns, sometimes a huge difference 3) More columns than
		rows, sometimes a huge difference 4) Complete decomposition is
		not possible or desired. Sometimes all components can not be
		calculated for different reasons. Big data, system resources or
		time can limit the desired number of principal components.
