		Random Coefficient Minification Time Series Models // Functions
		and data sets for simulating and fitting minification and
		random coefficient minification time series models. The nth
		term in the model X[n] is a nonnegative random variable defined
		as A[n]*min(X[n-1], Y[n]), where the A's and Y's are sequences
		of independent random variables.  Example data sets are
		provided where this kind of model can be justified on physical
		grounds and fits well.  Functions for simulating minification
		time series and for maximum  likelihood estimation are
		included. More information can be found in Han, Braun and
		Loeppky (2018) doi:10.1007/s00362-018-1000-6.
