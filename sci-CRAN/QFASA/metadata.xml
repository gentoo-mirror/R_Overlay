		Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature Analysis // Accurate estimates
		of the diets of predators are required in many areas of
		ecology, but for many species current methods are imprecise,
		limited to the last meal, and often biased. The diversity of
		fatty acids and their patterns in organisms, coupled with the
		narrow limitations on their biosynthesis, properties of
		digestion in monogastric animals, and the prevalence of large
		storage reservoirs of lipid in many predators, led to the
		development of quantitative fatty acid signature analysis
		(QFASA) to study predator diets.
