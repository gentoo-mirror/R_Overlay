		Enrichment Analysis and Intersecting Sankey Diagram // A flexible
		tool for enrichment analysis based on user-defined sets is
		provided. It allows users to perform over-representation
		analysis of the custom sets among any specified ranked feature
		list, hence making enrichment analysis applicable to various
		types of data from different scientific fields.
		'EnrichIntersect' also enables an interactive means to
		visualize identified associations based on, for example, the
		mix-lasso model (Zhao et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.isci.2022.104767) or similar methods.
