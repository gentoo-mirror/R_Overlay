		Refining Evaluation Methodology on Stage System // T (extent of
		the primary tumor), N (absence or presence and extent of
		regional lymph node metastasis) and M (absence or presence of
		distant metastasis) are three components to describe the
		anatomical tumor extent. TNM stage is important in treatment
		decision-making and outcome predicting. The existing
		oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC) TNM stages have not made distinction
		of the two sub sites of Human papillomavirus positive (HPV+)
		and Human papillomavirus negative (HPV-) diseases. We developed
		novel criteria to assess performance of the TNM stage grouping
		schemes based on parametric modeling adjusting on important
		clinical factors. These criteria evaluate the TNM stage
		grouping scheme in five different measures: hazard consistency,
		hazard discrimination, explained variation, likelihood
		difference, and balance. The methods are described in Xu, W.,
		et al. (2015) https://www.austinpublishinggroup.com/biometrics/
		fulltext/biometrics-v2-id1014.php.
