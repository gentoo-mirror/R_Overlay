		GLRT P-Values in Generalized Linear Models // Provides functions
		to compute Generalized Likelihood Ratio Tests (GLRT) also known
		as Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) and Rao's score tests of simple
		and complex contrasts of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). It
		provides the same interface as summary.glm(), adding GLRT
		P-values, less biased than Wald's P-values and consistent with
		profile-likelihood confidence interval generated by confint().
		See Wilks (1938) doi:10.1214/aoms/1177732360 for the LRT chi-
		square approximation. See Rao (1948)
		doi:10.1017/S0305004100023987 for Rao's score test. See Wald
		(1943) doi:10.2307/1990256 for Wald's test.
