		Scale Mixture of Normal Distribution in Linear Mixed-Effects
		Model // Bayesian analysis of censored linear mixed-effects
		models that replace Gaussian assumptions with a flexible class
		of distributions, such as the scale mixture of normal family
		distributions, considering a damped exponential correlation
		structure which was employed to account for within-subject
		autocorrelation among irregularly observed measures. For more
		details, see Zhong et al. (2025, forthcoming in Statistics in
		Medicine).
