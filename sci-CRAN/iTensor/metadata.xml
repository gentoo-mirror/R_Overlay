		ICA-Based Matrix/Tensor Decomposition // Some functions for
		performing ICA, MICA, Group ICA, and Multilinear ICA are
		implemented. ICA, MICA/Group ICA, and Multilinear ICA extract
		statistically independent components from single matrix,
		multiple matrices, and single tensor, respectively. For the
		details of these methods, see the reference section of GitHub
		README.md https://github.com/rikenbit/iTensor.
