		Bartz  Bartz Simulation Hospital // Implements a discrete-event
		simulation model for a hospital resource planning problem. The
		project is motivated by the challenges faced by health care
		institutions in the current COVID-19 pandemic. It can be used
		by health departments to forecast demand for intensive care
		beds, ventilators, and staff resources. Our modelling approach
		is inspired by "A novel modelling technique to predict resource
		requirements in critical care - a case study" (Lawton and
		McCooe 2019) and combines two powerful technologies: (i)
		discrete event simulation using the 'simmer' package and (ii)
		model-based optimization using 'SPOT'. Ucar I, Smeets B,
