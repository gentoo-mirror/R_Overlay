		Geostatistics Methods and Klovan Data // A comprehensive set of
		geostatistical, visual, and analytical methods, in conjunction
		with the expanded version of the acclaimed J.E. Klovan's mining
		dataset, are included in 'klovan'. This makes the package an
		excellent learning resource for Principal Component Analysis
		(PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), kriging, and other geostatistical
		techniques. Originally published in the 1976 book 'Geological
		Factor Analysis', the included mining dataset was assembled by
		Professor J. E. Klovan of the University of Calgary. Being one
		of the first applications of FA in the geosciences, this
		dataset has significant historical importance. As a well-
		regarded and published dataset, it is an excellent resource for
		demonstrating the capabilities of PCA, FA, kriging, and other
		geostatistical techniques in geosciences. For those interested
		in these methods, the 'klovan' datasets provide a valuable and
		illustrative resource. Note that some methods require the
		'RGeostats' package. Please refer to the README or
		Additional_repositories for installation instructions. This
		material is based upon research in the Materials Data Science
		for Stockpile Stewardship Center of Excellence (MDS3-COE), and
		supported by the Department of Energy's National Nuclear
		Security Administration under Award Number DE-NA0004104.
