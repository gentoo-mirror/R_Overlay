		Estimation of Large Block Covariance Matrices // Computation of
		large covariance matrices having a block structure up to a
		permutation of their columns and rows from a small number of
		samples with respect to the dimension of the matrix. The method
		is described in the paper Perrot-Docks et al. (2019)
