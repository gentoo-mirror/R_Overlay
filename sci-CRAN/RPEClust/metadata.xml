		Random Projection Ensemble Clustering Algorithm // Implements the
		methodology proposed by Anderlucci, Fortunato and Montanari
		(2019) arXiv:1909.10832 for high-dimensional unsupervised
		classification. The random projection ensemble clustering
		algorithm applies a Gaussian Mixture Model to different random
		projections of the high-dimensional data and selects a subset
		of solutions accordingly to the Bayesian Information Criterion,
		computed here as discussed in Raftery and Dean (2006)
		doi:10.1198/016214506000000113. The clustering results obtained
		on the selected projections are then aggregated via consensus
		to derive the final partition.
