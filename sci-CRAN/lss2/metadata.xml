		The Accelerated Failure Time Model to Right Censored Data Based
		on Least-Squares Principle // Due to lack of proper inference
		procedure and software, the ordinary linear regression model is
		seldom used in practice for the analysis of right censored
		data. This paper presents an S-Plus/R program that implements a
		recently developed inference procedure (Jin, Lin and Ying,
		2006) doi:10.1093/biomet/93.1.147 for the accelerated failure
		time model based on the least-squares principle.
