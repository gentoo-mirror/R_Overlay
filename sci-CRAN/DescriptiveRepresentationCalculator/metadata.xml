		Characterizing Observed and Expected Representation // A system
		for analyzing descriptive representation, especially for
		comparing the composition of a political body to the population
		it represents. Users can compute the expected degree of
		representation for a body under a random sampling model, the
		expected degree of representation variability, as well as
		representation scores from observed political bodies. The
		package is based on Gerring, Jerzak, and Oncel (2024)
