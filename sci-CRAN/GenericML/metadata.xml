		Generic Machine Learning Inference // Generic Machine Learning
		Inference on heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized
		experiments as proposed in Chernozhukov, Demirer, Duflo and
		Fernndez-Val (2020) arXiv:1712.04802. This package's workhorse
		is the 'mlr3' framework of Lang et al. (2019)
		doi:10.21105/joss.01903, which enables the specification of a
		wide variety of machine learners. The main functionality,
		GenericML(), runs Algorithm 1 in Chernozhukov, Demirer, Duflo
		and Fernndez-Val (2020) arXiv:1712.04802 for a suite of user-
		specified machine learners. All steps in the algorithm are
		customizable via setup functions. Methods for printing and
		plotting are available for objects returned by GenericML().
		Parallel computing is supported.
