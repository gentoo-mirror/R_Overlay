		Functions for Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS) //
		Functions for performing stochastic search variable selection
		(SSVS) for binary and continuous outcomes and visualizing the
		results. SSVS is a Bayesian variable selection method used to
		estimate the probability that individual predictors should be
		included in a regression model. Using MCMC estimation, the
		method samples thousands of regression models in order to
		characterize the model uncertainty regarding both the predictor
		set and the regression parameters. For details see Bainter,
		McCauley, Wager, and Losin (2020) Improving practices for
		selecting a subset of important predictors in psychology: An
		application to predicting pain, Advances in Methods and
		Practices in Psychological Science 3(1), 66-80
