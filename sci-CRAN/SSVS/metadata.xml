		Functions for Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS) //
		Functions for performing stochastic search variable selection
		(SSVS) for binary and continuous outcomes and visualizing the
		results. SSVS is a Bayesian variable selection method used to
		estimate the probability that individual predictors should be
		included in a regression model. Using MCMC estimation, the
		method samples thousands of regression models in order to
		characterize the model uncertainty regarding both the predictor
		set and the regression parameters.
