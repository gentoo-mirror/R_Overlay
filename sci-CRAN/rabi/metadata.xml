		Generate Codes to Uniquely and Robustly Identify Individuals for
		Animal Behavior Studies // Facilitates the design and
		generation of optimal color (or symbol) codes that can be used
		to mark and identify individual animals. These codes are made
		such that the IDs are robust to partial erasure: even if
		sections of the code are lost, the entire identity of the
		animal can be reconstructed. Thus, animal subjects are not
		confused and no ambiguity is introduced.
