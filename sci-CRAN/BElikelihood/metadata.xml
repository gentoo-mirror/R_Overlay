		Likelihood Method for Evaluating Bioequivalence // A likelihood
		method is implemented to present evidence for evaluating
		bioequivalence (BE). The functions use bioequivalence data
		[area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak
		concentration (Cmax)] from various crossover designs commonly
		used in BE studies including a fully replicated, a partially
		replicated design, and a conventional 2x2 crossover design.
		They will calculate the profile likelihoods for the mean
		difference, total standard deviation ratio, and within subject
		standard deviation ratio for a test and a reference drug. A
		plot of a standardized profile likelihood can be generated
		along with the maximum likelihood estimate and likelihood
		intervals, which present evidence for bioequivalence. See
