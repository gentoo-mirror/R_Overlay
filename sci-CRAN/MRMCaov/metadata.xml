		Multi-Reader Multi-Case Analysis of Variance // Estimation and
		comparison of the performances of diagnostic tests in multi-
		reader multi-case studies where true case statuses (or ground
		truths) are known and one or more readers provide test ratings
		for multiple cases.  Reader performance metrics are provided
		for area under and expected utility of ROC curves, likelihood
		ratio of positive or negative tests, and sensitivity and
		specificity.  ROC curves can be estimated empirically or with
		binormal or binormal likelihood-ratio models.  Statistical
		comparisons of diagnostic tests are based on the ANOVA model of
		Obuchowski-Rockette and the unified framework of Hillis (2005)
		doi:10.1002/sim.2024.  The ANOVA can be conducted with data
		from a full factorial, nested, or partially paired study
		design; with random or fixed readers or cases; and covariances
		estimated with the DeLong method, jackknifing, or an unbiased
		method.  Smith and Hillis (2020) doi:10.1117/12.2549075.
