		Use Least Squares Polynomial Regression and Statistical Testing
		to Improve Savitzky-Golay // This function takes a vector or
		matrix of data and smooths the data with an improved Savitzky
		Golay transform. The Savitzky-Golay method for data smoothing
		and differentiation calculates convolution weights using Gram
		polynomials that exactly reproduce the results of least-squares
		polynomial regression. Use of the Savitzky-Golay method
		requires specification of both filter length and polynomial
		degree to calculate convolution weights. For maximum smoothing
		of statistical noise in data, polynomials with low degrees are
		desirable, while a high polynomial degree is necessary for
		accurate reproduction of peaks in the data. Extension of the
		least-squares regression formalism with statistical testing of
		additional terms of polynomial degree to a heuristically chosen
		minimum for each data window leads to an adaptive-degree
		polynomial filter (ADPF). Based on noise reduction for data
		that consist of pure noise and on signal reproduction for data
		that is purely signal, ADPF performed nearly as well as the
		optimally chosen fixed-degree Savitzky-Golay filter and
		outperformed sub-optimally chosen Savitzky-Golay filters. For
		synthetic data consisting of noise and signal, ADPF
		outperformed both optimally chosen and sub-optimally chosen
		fixed-degree Savitzky-Golay filters. See Barak, P. (1995)
