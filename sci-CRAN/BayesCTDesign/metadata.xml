		Two Arm Bayesian Clinical Trial Design with and Without
		Historical Control Data // A set of functions to help clinical
		trial researchers calculate power and sample size for two-arm
		Bayesian randomized clinical trials that do or do not
		incorporate historical control data.  At some point during the
		design process, a clinical trial researcher who is designing a
		basic two-arm Bayesian randomized clinical trial needs to make
		decisions about power and sample size within the context of
		hypothesized treatment effects.  Through simulation, the
		simple_sim() function will estimate power and other user
		specified clinical trial characteristics at user specified
		sample sizes given user defined scenarios about treatment
		effect,control group characteristics, and outcome.  If the
		clinical trial researcher has access to historical control
		data, then the researcher can design a two-arm Bayesian
		randomized clinical trial that incorporates the historical
		data.  In such a case, the researcher needs to work through the
		potential consequences of historical and randomized control
		differences on trial characteristics, in addition to working
		through issues regarding power in the context of sample size,
		treatment effect size, and outcome.  If a researcher designs a
		clinical trial that will incorporate historical control data,
		the researcher needs the randomized controls to be from the
		same population as the historical controls.  What if this is
		not the case when the designed trial is implemented?  During
		the design phase, the researcher needs to investigate the
		negative effects of possible historic/randomized control
		differences on power, type one error, and other trial
		characteristics.  Using this information, the researcher should
		design the trial to mitigate these negative effects.  Through
		simulation, the historic_sim() function will estimate power and
		other user specified clinical trial characteristics at user
		specified sample sizes given user defined scenarios about
		historical and randomized control differences as well as
		treatment effects and outcomes.  The results from
		historic_sim() and simple_sim() can be printed with
		print_table() and graphed with plot_table() methods.  Outcomes
		considered are Gaussian, Poisson, Bernoulli, Lognormal,
		Weibull, and Piecewise Exponential.
