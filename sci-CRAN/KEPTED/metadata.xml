		Kernel-Embedding-of-Probability Test for Elliptical Distribution
		// Provides an implementation of a kernel-embedding of
		probability test for elliptical distribution. This is an
		asymptotic test for elliptical distribution under general
		alternatives, and the location and shape parameters are assumed
		to be unknown. Some side-products are posted, including the
		transformation between rectangular and polar coordinates and
		two product-type kernel functions. See Tang and Li (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2306.10594 for details.
