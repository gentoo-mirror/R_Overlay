		Global Value Chain Decomposition // Three global value chain
		(GVC) decompositions are implemented. The Leontief
		decomposition derives the value added origin of exports by
		country and industry as in Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001). The
		Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) decomposition splits country-level
		exports into 9 value added components, and the Wang, Wei and
		Zhu (2013) decomposition splits bilateral exports into 16 value
		added components. Various GVC indicators based on these
		decompositions are computed in the complimentary 'gvc' package.
