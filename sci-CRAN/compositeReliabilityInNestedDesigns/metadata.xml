		Optimizing the Composite Reliability in Multivariate Nested
		Designs // The reliability of assessment tools is a crucial
		aspect of monitoring student performance in various educational
		settings. It ensures that the assessment outcomes accurately
		reflect a student's true level of performance. However, when
		assessments are combined, determining composite reliability can
		be challenging, especially for naturalistic and unbalanced
		datasets in nested design as is often the case for Workplace-
		Based Assessments. This package is designed to estimate
		composite reliability in nested designs using multivariate
		generalizability theory and enhance the analysis of assessment
		data. The package allows for the inclusion of weight per
		assessment type and produces extensive G- and D-study results
		with graphical interpretations, and options to find the set of
		weights that maximizes the composite reliability or minimizes
		the standard error of measurement (SEM).
