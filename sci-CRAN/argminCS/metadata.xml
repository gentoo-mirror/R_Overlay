		Argmin Inference over a Discrete Candidate Set // Provides
		methods to construct frequentist confidence sets with valid
		marginal coverage for identifying the population-level argmin
		or argmax based on IID data. For instance, given an n by p loss
		matrixwhere n is the sample size and p is the number of
		modelsthe CS.argmin() method produces a discrete confidence set
		that contains the model with the minimal (best) expected risk
		with desired probability. The argmin.HT() method helps check if
		a specific model should be included in such a confidence set.
		The main implemented method is proposed by Tianyu Zhang, Hao
		Lee and Jing Lei (2024) "Winners with confidence: Discrete
		argmin inference with an application to model selection".
