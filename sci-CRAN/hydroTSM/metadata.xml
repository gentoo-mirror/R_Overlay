		Time Series Management and Analysis for Hydrological Modelling //
		S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and
		plotting of time series used in hydrology and related
		environmental sciences. In particular, this package is highly
		oriented to hydrological modelling tasks. The focus of this
		package has been put in providing a collection of tools useful
		for the daily work of hydrologists (although an effort was made
		to optimise each function as much as possible, functionality
		has had priority over speed). Bugs / comments / questions /
		collaboration of any kind are very welcomed, and in particular,
		datasets that can be included in this package for academic
		purposes.
