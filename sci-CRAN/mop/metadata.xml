		Mobility Oriented-Parity Metric // A set of tools to perform
		multiple versions of the Mobility Oriented-Parity metric. This
		multivariate analysis helps to characterize levels of
		dissimilarity between a set of conditions of reference and
		another set of conditions of interest. If predictive models are
		transferred to conditions different from those over which
		models were calibrated (trained), this metric helps to identify
		transfer conditions that differ substantially from those of
		calibration. These tools are implemented following principles
		proposed in Owens et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.011, and expanded to obtain
		more detailed results that aid in interpretation as in Cobos et
		al. (2024) doi:10.21425/fob.17.132916.
