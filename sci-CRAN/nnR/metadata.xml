		Neural Networks Made Algebraic // Do algebraic operations on
		neural networks. We seek here to implement in R, operations on
		neural networks and their resulting approximations. Our
		operations derive their descriptions mainly from Rafi S.,
		Padgett, J.L., and Nakarmi, U. (2024), "Towards an Algebraic
		Framework For Approximating Functions Using Neural Network
		Polynomials", doi:10.48550/arXiv.2402.01058, Grohs P., Hornung,
		F., Jentzen, A. et al. (2023), "Space-time error estimates for
		deep neural network approximations for differential equations",
		doi:10.1007/s10444-022-09970-2, Jentzen A., Kuckuck B., von
		Wurstemberger, P. (2023), "Mathematical Introduction to Deep
		Learning Methods, Implementations, and Theory"
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.20360. Our implementation is meant
		mainly as a pedagogical tool, and proof of concept. Faster
		implementations with deeper vectorizations may be made in
		future versions.
