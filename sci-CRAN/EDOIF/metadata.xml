		Empirical Distribution Ordering Inference Framework (EDOIF) // A
		non-parametric framework based on  estimation statistics
		principle. Its main purpose is to  infer orders of empirical
		distributions from different categories based on a probability
		of finding a value in one distribution that is greater than an
		expectation of another distribution. Given a set of ordered-
		pair of real-category values the framework is capable of 1)
		inferring orders of  domination  of  categories  and
		representing  orders  in  the form of a graph; 2) estimating
		magnitude  of  difference  between  a  pair  of categories in
		forms of mean-difference confidence intervals; and 3)
		visualizing  domination  orders  and  magnitudes  of
		difference of categories. The publication of this package is at
