		Simulation Education // Contains various functions to be used for
		simulation education, including simple Monte Carlo simulation
		functions, queueing simulation functions, variate generation
		functions capable of producing independent streams and
		antithetic variates, functions for illustrating random variate
		generation for various discrete and continuous distributions,
		and functions to compute time-persistent statistics.  Also
		contains two queueing data sets (one fabricated, one real-
		world) to facilitate input modeling.
