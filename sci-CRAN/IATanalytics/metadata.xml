		Compute Effect Sizes and Reliability for Implicit Association
		Test (IAT) Data // Quickly score raw data outputted from an
		Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee,  Schwartz,
		1998) doi:10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464. IAT scores are
		calculated as specified by Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003)
		doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197.    The output of this function
		is a data frame that consists of four rows containing the
		following information: (1) the overall IAT effect size for the
		participant's dataset, (2) the effect size calculated for odd
		trials only, (3) the effect size calculated for even trials
		only, and (4) the proportion of trials with reaction times
		under 300ms (which is important for exclusion purposes). Items
		(2) and (3) allow for a measure of the internal consistency of
		the IAT. Specifically, you can use the subsetted IAT effect
		sizes for odd and even trials to calculate Cronbach's alpha
		across participants in the sample.    The input function
		consists of three arguments. First, indicate the name of the
		dataset to be analyzed. This is the only required input.
		Second, indicate the number of trials in your entire IAT (the
		default is set to 220, which is typical for most IATs). Last,
		indicate whether congruent trials (e.g., flowers and pleasant)
		or incongruent trials (e.g., guns and pleasant) were presented
		first for this participant (the default is set to congruent).
		Data files should consist of six columns organized in order as
		follows: Block (0-6), trial (0-19 for training blocks, 0-39 for
		test blocks), category (dependent on your IAT), the type of
		item within that category (dependent on your IAT), a dummy
		variable indicating whether the participant was correct or
		incorrect on that trial (0=correct, 1=incorrect), and the
		participants reaction time (in milliseconds).    A sample
		dataset (titled 'sampledata') is included in this package to
		practice with.
