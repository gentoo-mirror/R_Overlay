		Inequality Constrained Inference in Linear Normal Situations //
		Implements inequality constrained inference. This includes
		parameter estimation in normal (linear) models under linear
		equality and inequality constraints, as well as normal
		likelihood ratio tests involving inequality-constrained
		hypotheses. For inequality-constrained linear models, averaging
		over R-squared for different orderings of regressors is also
		included.
