		Process and Analyse Data from m-Path Sense // Overcomes one of
		the major challenges in mobile (passive) sensing, namely being
		able to pre-process the raw data that comes from a mobile
		sensing app, specifically 'm-Path Sense' https://m-path.io. The
		main task of 'mpathsenser' is therefore to read 'm-Path Sense'
		JSON files into a database and provide several convenience
		functions to aid in data processing.
