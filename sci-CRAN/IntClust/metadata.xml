		Integration of Multiple Data Sets with Clustering Techniques //
		Several integrative data methods in which information of
		objects from different data sources can be combined are
		included in the IntClust package. As a single data source is
		limited in its point of view, this provides more insight and
		the opportunity to investigate how the variables are
		interconnected. Clustering techniques are to be applied to the
		combined information. For now, only agglomerative hierarchical
		clustering is implemented. Further, differential gene
		expression and pathway analysis can be conducted on the
		clusters. Plotting functions are available to visualize and
		compare results of the different methods.
