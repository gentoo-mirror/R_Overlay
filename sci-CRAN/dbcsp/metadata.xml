		Distance-Based Common Spatial Patterns // A way to apply
		Distance-Based Common Spatial Patterns (DB-CSP) techniques in
		different fields, both classical Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)
		as well as DB-CSP. The method is composed of two phases:
		applying the DB-CSP algorithm and performing a classification.
		The main idea behind the CSP is to use a linear transform to
		project data into low-dimensional subspace with a projection
		matrix, in such a way that each row consists of weights for
		signals. This transformation maximizes the variance of two-
		class signal matrices.The dbcsp object is created to compute
		the projection vectors. For exploratory and descriptive
		purpose, plot and boxplot functions can be used. Functions
		train, predict and selectQ are implemented for the
		classification step.
