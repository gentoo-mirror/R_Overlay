		Tri-Hierarchical IBDs (Tri- Hierarchical Incomplete Block
		Designs) // Tri-hierarchical incomplete block design is defined
		as an arrangement of v  treatments each replicated r  times in
		a three system of blocks if, each block of the first system
		contains m_1 blocks of second system and each block of the
		second system contains m_2 blocks of the third system. Ignoring
		the first and second system of blocks, it leaves an incomplete
		block design with b_3 blocks of size k_3i units; ignoring first
		and third system of blocks, it leaves an incomplete block
		design with b_2 blocks each of size k_2i units and ignoring the
		second and third system of blocks, it leaves an incomplete
		block design with b_1 blocks each of size k_1 units. For
		dealing with experimental circumstances where there are three
		nested sources of variation, a tri-hierarchical incomplete
		block design can be adopted. Tri - hierarchical incomplete
		block designs can find application potential in obtaining
		mating-environmental designs for breeding trials. To know more
		about nested block designs one can refer Preece (1967)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/54.3-4.479. This package includes series1(),
		series2(), series3() and series4() functions. This package
		generates tri-hierarchical designs with six component designs
		under certain parameter restrictions.
