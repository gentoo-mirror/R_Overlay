		Computation of Approximate Potentials for Weakly Non-Gradient
		Fields // Computation of approximate potentials for both
		gradient and non gradient fields. It is known from physics that
		only gradient fields, also known as conservative, have a well
		defined potential function. Here we present an algorithm, based
		on the classical Helmholtz decomposition, to obtain an
		approximate potential function for non gradient fields. More
		information in Rodrguez-Snchez (2020)
