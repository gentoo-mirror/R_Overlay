		Dynamic Logistic State Space Prediction Model // Implements the
		dynamic logistic state space model for binary outcome data
		proposed by Jiang et al. (2021) doi:10.1111/biom.13593. It
		provides a computationally efficient way to update the
		prediction whenever new data becomes available. It allows for
		both time-varying and time-invariant coefficients, and use
		cubic smoothing splines to model varying coefficients. The
		smoothing parameters are objectively chosen by maximum
		likelihood. The model is updated using batch data accumulated
		at pre-specified time intervals.
