		Do Currculo Lattes Para o Programa de Ps-Graduao // Managing
		postgraduate programmes involves extracting information from
		Lattes CVs. This information can be used for strategic planning
		and self-evaluation, as well as for producing reports on the
		Sucupira Platform. Summary reports are produced for each period
		and course (specialisation, master's and doctorate), showing
		bibliographic production with and without student
		participation, as well as papers at events, technical or
		technological production, ongoing and completed supervision,
		research projects, exchanges (visiting professor, postdoctoral
		or short-term leave), awards and general activity indicators.
		Based on this information, a detailed report is then drawn up
		for each lecturer, taking into account their participation in
		exam boards, their research project contributions, their
		technical collaborations (e.g. advisory committee, editorial
		board) and the subjects they teach. For more details see
		Pagliosa and Nascimento (2021) https://repositorio.ufsc.br/bits
