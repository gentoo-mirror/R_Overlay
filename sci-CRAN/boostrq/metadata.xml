		Boosting Regression Quantiles // Boosting Regression Quantiles is
		a component-wise boosting algorithm, that embeds all boosting
		steps in the well-established framework of quantile regression.
		It is initialized with the corresponding quantile, uses a
		quantile-specific learning rate, and uses quantile regression
		as its base learner. The package implements this algorithm and
		allows cross-validation and stability selection.
