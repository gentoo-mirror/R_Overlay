		Working with and Analyzing Functional Data of Varying Lengths //
		Comprehensive set of tools for analyzing and manipulating
		functional data with non-uniform lengths. This package
		addresses two common scenarios in functional data analysis:
		Variable Domain Data, where the observation domain differs
		across samples, and Partially Observed Data, where observations
		are incomplete over the domain of interest. 'VDPO' enhances the
		flexibility and applicability of functional data analysis in
		'R'. See Amaro et al. (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2401.05839.
