		Quantify the Robustness of Causal Inferences // Statistical
		methods that quantify the conditions necessary to alter
		inferences, also known as sensitivity analysis, are becoming
		increasingly important to a variety of quantitative sciences. A
		series of recent works, including Frank (2000)
		doi:10.1177/0049124100029002001 and Frank et al. (2013)
		doi:10.3102/0162373713493129 extend previous sensitivity
		analyses by considering the characteristics of omitted
		variables or unobserved cases that would change an inference if
		such variables or cases were observed. These analyses generate
		statements such as "an omitted variable would have to be
		correlated at xx with the predictor of interest (e.g.,
		treatment) and outcome to invalidate an inference of a
		treatment effect". Or "one would have to replace pp percent of
		the observed data with null hypothesis cases to invalidate the
		inference". We implement these recent developments of
		sensitivity analysis and provide modules to calculate these two
		robustness indices and generate such statements in R. In
		particular, the functions konfound(), pkonfound() and
		mkonfound() allow users to calculate the robustness of
		inferences for a user's own model, a single published study and
		multiple studies respectively.
