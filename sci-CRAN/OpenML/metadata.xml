		Open Machine Learning and Open Data Platform // We provide an R
		interface to 'OpenML.org' which is an online machine learning
		platform where researchers can access open data, download and
		upload data sets, share their machine learning tasks and
		experiments and organize them online to work and collaborate
		with other researchers. The R interface allows to query for
		data sets with specific properties, and allows the downloading
		and uploading of data sets, tasks, flows and runs. See
		https://www.openml.org/guide/api for more information.
