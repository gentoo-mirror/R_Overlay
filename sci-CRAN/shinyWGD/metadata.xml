		'Shiny' Application for Whole Genome Duplication Analysis //
		Provides a comprehensive 'Shiny' application for analyzing
		Whole Genome Duplication ('WGD') events. This package provides
		a user-friendly 'Shiny' web application for non-experienced
		researchers to prepare input data and execute command lines for
		several well-known 'WGD' analysis tools, including 'wgd',
		'ksrates', 'i-ADHoRe', 'OrthoFinder', and 'Whale'. This package
		also provides the source code for experienced researchers to
		adjust and install the package to their own server. Key
		Features 1) Input Data Preparation This package allows users to
		conveniently upload and format their data, making it compatible
		with various 'WGD' analysis tools. 2) Command Line Generation
		This package automatically generates the necessary command
		lines for selected 'WGD' analysis tools, reducing manual errors
		and saving time. 3) Visualization This package offers
		interactive visualizations to explore and interpret 'WGD'
		results, facilitating in-depth 'WGD' analysis. 4) Comparative
		Genomics Users can study and compare 'WGD' events across
		different species, aiding in evolutionary and comparative
		genomics studies. 5) User-Friendly Interface This 'Shiny' web
		application provides an intuitive and accessible interface,
		making 'WGD' analysis accessible to researchers and
		'bioinformaticians' of all levels.
