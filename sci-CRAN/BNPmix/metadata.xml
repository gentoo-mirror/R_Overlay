		Algorithms for Pitman-Yor Process Mixtures // Contains different
		algorithms to both univariate and multivariate Pitman-Yor
		process mixture models, and Griffiths-Milne Dependent Dirichlet
		process mixture models. Pitman-Yor process mixture models are
		flexible Bayesian nonparametric models to deal with density
		estimation. Estimation could be done via importance conditional
		sampler, or via slice sampler, as done by Walker (2007)
		doi:10.1080/03610910601096262, or using a marginal sampler, as
		in Escobar and West (1995) doi:10.2307/2291069 and extensions.
		The package contains also the procedures to estimate via
		importance conditional sampler a GM-Dependent Dirichlet process
		mixture model.
