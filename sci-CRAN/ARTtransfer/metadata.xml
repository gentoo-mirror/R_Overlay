		Adaptive and Robust Pipeline for Transfer Learning // Adaptive
		and Robust Transfer Learning (ART) is a flexible framework for
		transfer learning that integrates information from auxiliary
		data sources to improve model performance on primary tasks. It
		is designed to be robust against negative transfer by including
		the non-transfer model in the candidate pool, ensuring stable
		performance even when auxiliary datasets are less informative.
