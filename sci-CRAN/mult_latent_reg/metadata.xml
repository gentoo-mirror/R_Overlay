		Regression and Clustering in Multivariate Response Scenarios //
		Fitting multivariate response models with random effects on one
		or two levels; whereby the (one-dimensional) random effect
		represents a latent variable approximating the multivariate
		space of outcomes, after possible adjustment for covariates.
		The method is particularly useful for multivariate, highly
		correlated outcome variables with unobserved heterogeneities.
		Applications include regression with multivariate responses, as
		well as multivariate clustering or ranking problems. See Zhang
		and Einbeck (2024) doi:10.1007/s42519-023-00357-0.
