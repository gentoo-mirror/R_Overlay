		Visualizing the Decision Rules Underlying Binary Classification
		// Visualization of decision rules for binary classification
		and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve estimation
		under different generalizations: - making the classification
		subsets flexible to cover those scenarios where both extremes
		of the marker are associated with a higher risk of being
		positive, considering two thresholds (gROC curve); -
		transforming the marker by a function either defined by the
		user or resulting from a logistic regression model (hROC
		curve); - considering a linear transformation with some fixed
		parameters introduced by the user, dynamic parameters or
		empirically maximizing TPR for each FPR for a bivariate marker.
		Also a quadratic transformation with particular coefficients or
		a function fitted by a logistic regression model can be
		considered (biROC curve); - considering a linear transformation
		with some fixed parameters introduced by the user, dynamic
		parameters or a function fitted by a logistic regression model
		(multiROC curve). The classification regions behind each point
		of the ROC curve are displayed in both fixed graphics
		(plot.buildROC(), plot.regions() or plot.funregions() function)
		or videos (movieROC() function).
