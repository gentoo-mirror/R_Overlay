		Visualizing the Decision Rules Underlying Binary Classification
		// Visualization of decision rules for binary classification
		and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve estimation
		under different generalizations proposed in the literature: -
		making the classification subsets flexible to cover those
		scenarios where both extremes of the marker are associated with
		a higher risk of being positive, considering two thresholds
		(gROC() function); - transforming the marker by a proper
		function trying to improve the classification performance
		(hROC() function); - when dealing with multivariate markers,
		considering a proper transformation to univariate space trying
		to maximize the resulting AUC of the TPR for each FPR
		(multiROC() function). The classification regions behind each
		point of the ROC curve are displayed in both static graphics
		(plot_buildROC(), plot_regions() or plot_funregions() function)
		or videos (movieROC() function).
