		Fast and Robust Surrogate Variable Analysis // Introduces a fast
		and efficient Surrogate Variable Analysis algorithm that
		captures variation of unknown sources (batch effects) for high-
		dimensional data sets. The algorithm is built on the
		'irwsva.build' function of the 'sva' package and proposes a
		revision on it that achieves more than 10 times faster running
		time while trading no accuracy loss in return.
