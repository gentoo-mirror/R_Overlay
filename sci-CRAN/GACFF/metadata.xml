		Genetic Similarity in User-Based Collaborative Filtering // The
		genetic algorithm can be used directly to find the similarity
		of users and more effectively to increase the efficiency of the
		collaborative filtering method. By identifying the nearest
		neighbors to the active user, before the genetic algorithm, and
		by identifying suitable starting points, an effective method
		for user-based collaborative filtering method has been
		developed. This package uses an optimization algorithm
		(continuous genetic algorithm) to directly find the optimal
		similarities between active users (users for whom current
		recommendations are made) and others. First, by determining the
		nearest neighbor and their number, the number of genes in a
		chromosome is determined. Each gene represents the neighbor's
		similarity to the active user. By estimating the starting
		points of the genetic algorithm, it quickly converges to the
		optimal solutions. The positive point is the independence of
		the genetic algorithm on the number of data that for big data
		is an effective help in solving the problem.
