		Multi-Omic Integration via Sparse Singular Value Decomposition //
		High dimensionality, noise and heterogeneity among samples and
		features challenge the omic integration task. Here we present
		an omic integration method based on sparse singular value
		decomposition (SVD) to deal with these limitations, by: a.
		obtaining the main axes of variation of the combined omics, b.
		imposing sparsity constraints at both subjects (rows) and
		features (columns) levels using Elastic Net type of shrinkage,
		and d. allowing both linear and non-linear projections (via
		t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) of the omic data to detect
		clusters in very convoluted data (Gonzalez-Reymundez  Vazquez,
		2020) doi:10.1038/s41598-020-65119-5.
