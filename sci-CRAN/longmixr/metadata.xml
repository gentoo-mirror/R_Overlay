		Longitudinal Consensus Clustering with 'flexmix' // An adaption
		of the consensus clustering approach from
		'ConsensusClusterPlus' for longitudinal data. The longitudinal
		data is clustered with flexible mixture models from 'flexmix',
		while the consensus matrices are hierarchically clustered as in
		'ConsensusClusterPlus'. By using the flexibility from 'flexmix'
		and 'FactoMineR', one can use mixed data types for the
		clustering.
