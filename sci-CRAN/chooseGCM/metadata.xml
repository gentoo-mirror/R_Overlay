		Selecting General Circulation Models for Species Distribution
		Modeling // Methods to help selecting General Circulation
		Models (GCMs) in the context of projecting models to future
		scenarios. It is provided clusterization algorithms, distance
		and correlation metrics, as well as a tailor-made algorithm to
		detect the optimum subset of GCMs that recreate the environment
		of all GCMs as proposed in Esser et al. (2025)
