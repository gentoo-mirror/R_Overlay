		Characterizing Differential Expression of Selected Edges on a
		Network // A toy model studying expressions of selected edges
		(namely a sub-network) on a network. We aim to characterize how
		the lengths of selected edges vary between two phenotypes based
		on t tests results. Two statistics, AT1 and AT2, are computed
		to summarize the t tests results and distinguish the
		differentially expressed patterns of the sub-network.
