		Topological Sort-Based Hierarchy Inference // Deciphering
		hierarchy of agents exhibiting observable dominance events is a
		crucial problem in several disciplines, in particular in
		behavioural analysis of social animals, but also in social
		sciences and game theory. This package implements an inference
		approach based on graph theory, namely to extract the optimal
		acyclic subset of a weighted graph of dominance; this allows
		for hierarchy estimation through topological sorting. The
		package also contains infrastructure to investigate partially
		defined hierarchies and hierarchy dynamics.
