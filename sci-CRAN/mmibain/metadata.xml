		Bayesian Informative Hypotheses Evaluation Web Applications //
		Researchers often have expectations about the relations between
		means of different groups or standardized regression
		coefficients; using informative hypothesis testing to
		incorporate these expectations into the analysis through order
		constraints increases statistical power Vanbrabant and Rosseel
		(2020) doi:10.4324/9780429273872-14. Another valuable tool, the
		Bayes factor, can evaluate evidence for multiple hypotheses
		without concerns about multiple testing, and can be used in
		Bayesian updating Hoijtink, Mulder, van Lissa  Gu (2019)
		doi:10.1037/met0000201. The 'bain' R package enables
		informative hypothesis testing using the Bayes factor. The
		'mmibain' package provides 'shiny' web applications based on
		'bain'. The RepliCrisis() function launches a 'shiny' card game
		to simulate the evaluation of replication studies while the
		mmibain() function launches a 'shiny' application to fit
		Bayesian informative hypotheses evaluation models from 'bain'.
