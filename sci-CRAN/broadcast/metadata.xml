		Broadcasted Array Operations Like 'NumPy' // Implements efficient
		'NumPy'-like broadcasted operations for atomic and recursive
		arrays. Besides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not use any
		external libraries in any way; 'broadcast' was essentially made
		from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box. The
		implementations available in 'broadcast' include, but are not
		limited to, the following. 1) Broadcasted element-wise
		operations on any 2 arrays; they support a large set of
		relational, arithmetic, Boolean, string, and bit-wise
		operations. 2) A faster, more memory efficient, and broadcasted
		abind-like function, for binding arrays along an arbitrary
		dimension. 3) Broadcasted ifelse-like, and apply-like
		functions. 4) Casting functions, that cast subset-groups of an
		array to a new dimension, cast nested lists to dimensional
		lists, and vice-versa. 5) A few linear algebra functions for
		statistics. The functions in the 'broadcast' package strive to
		minimize computation time and memory usage (which is not just
		good for efficient computing, but also for the environment).
