		Fits the Bayesian Piecewise Linear Log-Hazard Model // Contains
		posterior samplers for the Bayesian piecewise linear log-hazard
		and piecewise exponential hazard models, including Cox models.
		Posterior mean restricted survival times are also computed for
		non-Cox an Cox models with only treatment indicators. The
		ApproxMean() function can be used to estimate restricted
		posterior mean survival times given a vector of patient
		covariates in the Cox model. Functions included to return the
		posterior mean hazard and survival functions for the piecewise
		exponential and piecewise linear log-hazard models. Chapple,
		AG, Peak, T, Hemal, A (2020). Under Revision.
