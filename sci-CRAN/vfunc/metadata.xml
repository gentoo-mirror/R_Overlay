		Manipulate Virtual Functions // If f - function(x){x^2} and g -
		function(x){x+1} it is a constant source of annoyance that
		"f+g" is not defined. Package 'vfunc' allows you to do this,
		and we have (f+g)(2) returning 5.  The other arithmetic
		operators are similarly implemented.  A wide class of coding
		bugs is eliminated.
