		Pen's Income Parades // Tool for producing Pen's parade graphs,
		useful for visualizing inequalities in income, wages or other
		variables, as proposed by Pen (1971, ISBN: 978-0140212594).
		Income or another economic variable is captured by the vertical
		axis, while the population is arranged in ascending order of
		income along the horizontal axis. Pen's income parades provide
		an easy-to-interpret visualization of economic inequalities.
