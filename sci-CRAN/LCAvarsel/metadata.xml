		Variable Selection for Latent Class Analysis // Variable
		selection for latent class analysis for model-based clustering
		of multivariate categorical data. The package implements a
		general framework for selecting the subset of variables with
		relevant clustering information and discard those that are
		redundant and/or not informative. The variable selection method
		is based on the approach of Fop et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1214/17-AOAS1061 and Dean and Raftery (2010)
		doi:10.1007/s10463-009-0258-9. Different algorithms are
		available to perform the selection: stepwise, swap-stepwise and
		evolutionary stochastic search. Concomitant covariates used to
		predict the class membership probabilities can also be included
		in the latent class analysis model. The selection procedure can
		be run in parallel on multiple cores machines.
