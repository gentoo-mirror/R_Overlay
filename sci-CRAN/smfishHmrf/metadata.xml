		Hidden Markov Random Field for Spatial Transcriptomic Data //
		Discovery of spatial patterns with Hidden Markov Random Field.
		This package is designed for spatial transcriptomic data and
		single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) data
		such as sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH)
		and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization
		(MERFISH). The methods implemented in this package are
		described in Zhu et al. (2018) doi:10.1038/nbt.4260.
