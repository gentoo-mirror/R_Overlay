		Statistical Inference for Persistence Homology Data // A set of
		functions for performing null hypothesis testing on samples of
		persistence diagrams using the theory of permutations.
		Currently, only two-sample testing is implemented. Inputs can
		be either samples of persistence diagrams themselves or
		vectorizations. In the former case, they are embedded in a
		metric space using either the Bottleneck or Wasserstein
		distance. In the former case, persistence data becomes
		functional data and inference is performed using tools
		available in the 'fdatest' package. Main reference for the
		interval-wise testing method: Pini A., Vantini S. (2017)
		"Interval-wise testing for functional data"
		doi:10.1080/10485252.2017.1306627. Main reference for inference
		on populations of networks: Lovato, I., Pini, A., Stamm, A.,
		Vantini, S. (2020) "Model-free two-sample test for network-
		valued data" doi:10.1016/j.csda.2019.106896.
