		Integrative Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Approaches // To
		integrate multiple GSEA studies, we propose a hybrid strategy,
		iGSEA-AT, for choosing random effects (RE) versus fixed effect
		(FE) models, with an attempt to achieve the potential maximum
		statistical efficiency as well as stability in performance in
		various practical situations. In addition to iGSEA-AT, this
		package also provides options to perform integrative GSEA with
		testing based on a FE model (iGSEA-FE) and testing based on a
		RE model (iGSEA-RE). The approaches account for different set
		sizes when testing a database of gene sets. The function is
		easy to use, and the three approaches can be applied to both
		binary and continuous phenotypes.
