		Analysis of Plant Pathogen Pathotype Complexities, Distributions
		and Diversity // Analysis of plant pathogen pathotype survey
		data.  Functions provided calculate distribution of
		susceptibilities, distribution of complexities with statistics,
		pathotype frequency distribution, as well as diversity indices
		for pathotypes.  This package is meant to be a direct
		replacement for Herrmann, Lwer, Schachtel's (1999)
		doi:10.1046/j.1365-3059.1999.00325.x Habgood-Gilmour
