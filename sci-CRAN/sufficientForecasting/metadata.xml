		Sufficient Forecasting using Factor Models // The sufficient
		forecasting (SF) method is implemented by this package for a
		single time series forecasting using many predictors and a
		possibly nonlinear forecasting function. Assuming that the
		predictors are driven by some latent factors, the SF first
		conducts factor analysis and then performs sufficient dimension
		reduction on the estimated factors to derive predictive indices
		for forecasting. The package implements several dimension
		reduction approaches, including principal components (PC),
		sliced inverse regression (SIR), and directional regression
		(DR). Methods for dimension reduction are as described in: Fan,
		J., Xue, L. and Yao, J. (2017)
