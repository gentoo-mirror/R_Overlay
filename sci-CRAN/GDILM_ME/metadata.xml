		Spatial Modeling of Infectious Diseases with Co-Variate Error //
		Provides tools for simulating from spatial modeling of
		individual level  of infectious disease transmission when co-
		variates measured with error, and carrying out infectious
		disease data analyses with the same models. The epidemic models
		considered are distance-based model within Susceptible-
		Infectious-Removed (SIR) compartmental frameworks.
