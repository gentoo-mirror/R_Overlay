		Mixed Effects Cox Models // Fit Cox proportional hazards models
		containing both fixed and random effects.  The random effects
		can have a general form, of which familial interactions (a
		"kinship" matrix) is a particular special case. Note that the
		simplest case of a mixed effects Cox model, i.e. a single
		random per-group intercept, is also called a "frailty" model.
		The approach is based on Ripatti and Palmgren, Biometrics 2002.
