		A Tool for Large-Scale Exploratory Analyses // Conduct numerous
		exploratory analyses in an instant with a point-and-click
		interface. With one simple command, this tool launches a Shiny
		App on the local machine. Drag and drop variables in a data set
		to categorize them as possible independent, dependent,
		moderating, or mediating variables. Then run dozens (or
		hundreds) of analyses instantly to uncover any statistically
		significant relationships among variables. Any relationship
		thus uncovered should be tested in follow-up studies. This tool
		is designed only to facilitate exploratory analyses and should
		NEVER be used for p-hacking. Many of the functions used in this
		package are direct copies of functions in the R Package 'kim'
		and 'ezr'. Selected References: Chang et al. (2021)
