		Phylogeny-Guided OTU-Specific Association Test for Microbiome
		Data // Implements the Phylogeny-Guided Microbiome OTU-Specific
		Association Test method, which boosts the testing power by
		adaptively borrowing information from phylogenetically close
		OTUs (operational taxonomic units) of the target OTU. This
		method is built on a kernel machine regression framework and
		allows for flexible modeling of complex microbiome effects,
		adjustments for covariates, and can accommodate both continuous
		and binary outcomes.
