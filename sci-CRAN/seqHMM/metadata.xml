		Mixture Hidden Markov Models for Social Sequence Data and Other
		Multivariate, Multichannel Categorical Time Series // Designed
		for estimating variants of hidden (latent) Markov models
		(HMMs), mixture HMMs, and non-homogeneous HMMs (NHMMs) for
		social sequence data and other categorical time series. Special
		cases include feedback-augmented NHMMs, Markov models without
		latent layer, mixture Markov models, and latent class models.
		The package supports models for one or multiple subjects with
		one or multiple parallel sequences (channels). External
		covariates can be added to explain cluster membership in
		mixture models as well as initial, transition and emission
		probabilities in NHMMs. The package provides functions for
		evaluating and comparing models, as well as functions for
		visualizing of multichannel sequence data and HMMs. For NHMMs,
		methods for computing average causal effects and marginal state
		and emission probabilities are available. Models are estimated
		using maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm or direct
		numerical maximization with analytical gradients. Documentation
		is available via several vignettes, and Helske and Helske
		(2019, doi:10.18637/jss.v088.i03). For methodology behind the
		NHMMs, see Helske (2025, doi:10.48550/arXiv.2503.16014).
