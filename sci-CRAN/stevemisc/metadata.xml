		Steve's Miscellaneous Functions // These are miscellaneous
		functions that I find useful for my research and teaching. The
		contents include themes for plots, functions for simulating
		quantities of interest from regression models, functions for
		simulating various forms of fake data for
		instructional/research purposes, and many more. All told, the
		functions provided here are broadly useful for data
		organization, data presentation, data recoding, and data
		simulation.
