		Monitoring a Developing Pandemic with Available Data // Full
		dynamic system to describe and forecast the spread and the
		severity of a developing pandemic, based on available data.
		These data are number of infections, hospitalizations, deaths
		and recoveries notified each day. The system consists of three
		transitions, infection-infection, infection-hospital and
		hospital-death/recovery. The intensities of these transitions
		are dynamic and estimated using non-parametric local linear
		estimators. The package can be used to provide forecasts and
		survival indicators such as the median time spent in hospital
		and the probability that a patient who has been in hospital for
		a number of days can leave it alive. Methods are described in
		Gmiz, Mammen, Martnez-Miranda, and Nielsen (2024)
