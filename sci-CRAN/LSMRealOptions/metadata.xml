		Value American and Real Options Through LSM Simulation // The
		least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation method is a popular
		method for the approximation of the value of early and multiple
		exercise options. 'LSMRealOptions' provides implementations of
		the LSM simulation method to value American option products and
		capital investment projects through real options analysis.
		'LSMRealOptions' values capital investment projects with cash
		flows dependent upon underlying state variables that are
		stochastically evolving, providing analysis into the timing and
		critical values at which investment is optimal.
		'LSMRealOptions' provides flexibility in the stochastic
		processes followed by underlying assets, the number of state
		variables, basis functions and underlying asset characteristics
		to allow a broad range of assets to be valued through the LSM
		simulation method. Real options projects are further able to be
		valued whilst considering construction periods, time-varying
		initial capital expenditures and path-dependent operational
		flexibility including the ability to temporarily shutdown or
		permanently abandon projects after initial investment has
		occurred. The LSM simulation method was first presented in the
		prolific work of Longstaff and Schwartz (2001)
