		Design of Clinical Trials with the Desirability of Outcome
		Ranking Methodology // Statistical methods and related
		graphical representations for the Desirability of Outcome
		Ranking (DOOR) methodology. The DOOR is a paradigm for the
		design, analysis, interpretation of clinical trials and other
		research studies based on the patient centric benefit risk
		evaluation. The package provides functions for generating
		summary statistics from individual level/summary level
		datasets, conduct DOOR probability-based inference, and
		visualization of the results. For more details of DOOR
		methodology, see "Handbook of Generalized Pairwise
		Comparisons", Chapter 13 doi:10.1201/9781003390855. For more
		explanation of the statistical methods and the graphics, see
		the technical document and user manual of the DOOR 'Shiny' apps
