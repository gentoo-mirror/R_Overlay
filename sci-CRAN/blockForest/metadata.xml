		Block Forests: Random Forests for Blocks of Clinical and Omics
		Covariate Data // A random forest variant 'block forest'
		('BlockForest') tailored to the prediction of binary, survival
		and continuous outcomes using block-structured covariate data,
		for example, clinical covariates plus measurements of a certain
		omics data type or multi-omics data, that is, data for which
		measurements of different types of omics data and/or clinical
		data for each patient exist. Examples of different omics data
		types include gene expression measurements, mutation data and
		copy number variation measurements. Block forest are presented
		in Hornung  Wright (2018). The package includes four other
		random forest variants for multi-omics data: 'RandomBlock',
		'BlockVarSel', 'VarProb', and 'SplitWeights'. These were also
		considered in Hornung  Wright (2018), but performed worse than
		block forest in their comparison study based on 20 real multi-
		omics data sets. Therefore, we recommend to use block forest
		('BlockForest') in applications. The other random forest
		variants can, however, be consulted for academic purposes, for
		example, in the context of further methodological developments.
