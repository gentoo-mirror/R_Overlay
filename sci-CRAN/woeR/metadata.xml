		Weight of Evidence Based Segmentation of a Variable // Segment a
		numeric variable based on a dichotomous dependent variable by
		using the weight of evidence (WOE) approach (Ref: Siddiqi, N.
		(2006) doi:10.1002/9781119201731.biblio). The underlying
		algorithm adopts a recursive approach to create segments that
		are diverse in respect of their WOE values and meet the demands
		of user-defined parameters. The algorithm also aims to maintain
		a monotonic trend in WOE values of consecutive segments. As
		such, it can be particularly helpful in improving robustness of
		linear and logistic regression models.
