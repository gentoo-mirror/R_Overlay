		Functions to Estimate Tree Volume and Phytomass in the Italian
		Forest Inventory 2005 // Tabacchi et al. (2011) published a
		very detailed study producing a uniform system of functions to
		estimate tree volume and phytomass components (stem, branches,
		stool). The estimates of the 2005 Italian forest inventory
		(https://www.inventarioforestale.org/it/) are based on these
		functions. The study documents the domain of applicability of
		each function and the equations to quantify estimates
		accuracies for individual estimates as well as for aggregated
		estimates. This package makes the functions available in the R
		environment. Version 2 exposes two distinct functions for
		individual and summary estimates. To facilitate access to the
		functions, tree species identification is now based on EPPO
		species codes (https://data.eppo.int/).
