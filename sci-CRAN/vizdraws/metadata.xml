		Visualize Draws from the Prior and Posterior Distributions //
		Interactive visualization for Bayesian prior and posterior
		distributions. When both distributions are provided the
		animation shows a transition from prior to posterior. Finally,
		the animation splits the distribution using the provided
		'breaks' into bars that show the probability for each region.
		If no 'breaks' are providers it will use zero by default.
