		Easy and Accessible Bayesian Measurement Models Using 'brms' //
		Fit computational and measurement models using full Bayesian
		inference. The package provides a simple and accessible
		interface by translating complex domain-specific models into
		'brms' syntax, a powerful and flexible framework for fitting
		Bayesian regression models using 'Stan'. The package is
		designed so that users can easily apply state-of-the-art models
		in various research fields, and so that researchers can use it
		as a new model development framework. References: Frischkorn
		and Popov (2023) doi:10.31234/osf.io/umt57.
