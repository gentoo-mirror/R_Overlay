		Manage Competition Results // Tools for storing and managing
		competition results. Competition is understood as a set of
		games in which players gain some abstract scores. There are two
		ways for storing results: in long (one row per game-player) and
		wide (one row per game with fixed amount of players) formats.
		This package provides functions for creation and conversion
		between them. Also there are functions for computing their
		summary and Head-to-Head values for players. They leverage
		grammar of data manipulation from 'dplyr'.
