		A Matrix-Free Multigrid Preconditioner for Spline Smoothing //
		Data smoothing with penalized splines is a popular method and
		is well established for one- or two-dimensional covariates. The
		extension to multiple covariates is straightforward but suffers
		from exponentially increasing memory requirements and
		computational complexity. This toolbox provides a matrix-free
		implementation of a conjugate gradient (CG) method for the
		regularized least squares problem resulting from tensor product
		B-spline smoothing with multivariate and scattered data. It
		further provides matrix-free preconditioned versions of the CG-
		algorithm where the user can choose between a simpler diagonal
		preconditioner and an advanced geometric multigrid
		preconditioner. The main advantage is that all algorithms are
		performed matrix-free and therefore require only a small amount
		of memory. For further detail see Siebenborn  Wagner (2021).
