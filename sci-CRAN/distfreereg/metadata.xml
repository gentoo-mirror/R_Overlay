		Distribution-Free Goodness-of-Fit Testing for Regression //
		Implements the distribution-free goodness-of-fit regression
		test for the mean structure of parametric models introduced in
		Khmaladze (2021) doi:10.1007/s10463-021-00786-3. The test is
		implemented for general functions with minimal distributional
		assumptions as well as common models (e.g., lm, glm) with the
		usual assumptions.
