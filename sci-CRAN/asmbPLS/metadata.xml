		Predicting and Classifying Patient Phenotypes with Multi-Omics
		Data // Adaptive Sparse Multi-block Partial Least Square, a
		supervised algorithm, is an extension of the Sparse Multi-block
		Partial Least Square, which allows different quantiles to be
		used in different blocks of different partial least square
		components to decide the proportion of features to be retained.
		The best combinations of quantiles can be chosen from a set of
		user-defined quantiles combinations by cross-validation. By
		doing this, it enables us to do the feature selection for
		different blocks, and the selected features can then be further
		used to predict the outcome. For example, in biomedical
		applications, clinical covariates plus different types of omics
		data such as microbiome, metabolome, mRNA data, methylation
		data, copy number variation data might be predictive for
		patients outcome such as survival time or response to therapy.
		Different types of data could be put in different blocks and
		along with survival time to fit the model. The fitted model can
		then be used to predict the survival for the new samples with
		the corresponding clinical covariates and omics data. In
		addition, Adaptive Sparse Multi-block Partial Least Square
		Discriminant Analysis is also included, which extends Adaptive
		Sparse Multi-block Partial Least Square for classifying the
		categorical outcome.
