		Creates an Interactive Tree Structure of a Directory //
		Represents the content of a directory as an interactive
		collapsible tree. Offers the possibility to assign a text

		clickable node), so that when the user hovers the pointer over
		a node, the corresponding text is displayed as a tooltip.
