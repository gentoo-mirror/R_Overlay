		Tools for CM SAF NetCDF Data // The Satellite Application
		Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) is a ground segment of
		the European Organization for the Exploitation of
		Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and one of EUMETSATs
		Satellite Application Facilities. The CM SAF contributes to the
		sustainable observing of the climate system by providing
		Essential Climate Variables related to the energy and water
		cycle of the atmosphere (http://www.cmsaf.eu). It is a joint
		cooperation of seven National Meteorological and Hydrological
		Services. The 'cmsaf' R-package provides a small collection of
		R-functions, which are inspired by the Climate Data Operators
		('cdo'). This gives the opportunity to analyse and manipulate
		CM SAF data without the need of installing cdo. The 'cmsaf'
		R-package is tested for CM SAF NetCDF data, which are
		structured in three-dimensional arrays (longitude, latitude,
		time) on a rectangular grid. Layered CM SAF data have to be
		converted with the provided 'levbox_mergetime()' function. The
		'cmsaf' R-package functions have only minor checks for
		deviations from the recommended data structure, and give only
		few specific error messages. Thus, there is no warranty of
		accurate results. Scripts for an easy application of the
		functions are provided at the CM SAF homepage
		(http://www.cmsaf.eu/EN/Products/Tools/Tools_node.html).
