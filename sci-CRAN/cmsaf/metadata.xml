		Tools for CM SAF NetCDF Data // The Satellite Application
		Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) is a ground segment of
		the European Organization for the Exploitation of
		Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and one of EUMETSATs
		Satellite Application Facilities. The CM SAF contributes to the
		sustainable observing of the climate system by providing
		essential climate variables related to the energy and water
		cycle of the atmosphere (http://www.cmsaf.eu). It is a joint
		cooperation of seven National Meteorological and Hydrological
		Services. The 'cmsaf' R-package provides a collection of
		R-operators for the analysis and manipulation of CM SAF NetCDF
		formatted data. The 'cmsaf' R-package is tested for CM SAF
		NetCDF data, which are structured in three-dimensional arrays
		(longitude, latitude, time) on a rectangular grid. Layered CM
		SAF data have to be converted with the provided
		levbox_mergetime() function. The 'cmsaf' R-package operators
		have only minor checks for deviations from the recommended data
		structure, and give only few specific error messages. Scripts
		for an easy application of the 'cmsaf' package operators and
		the preparation and visualization of CM SAF NetCDF data are
		provided at the CM SAF webpage
		(http://www.cmsaf.eu/EN/Products/Tools/Tools_node.html).
