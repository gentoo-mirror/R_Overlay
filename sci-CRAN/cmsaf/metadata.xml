		Tools for CM SAF netcdf data // The Satellite Application
		Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) is a ground segment of
		the European Organization for the Exploitation of
		Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and one of EUMETSATs
		Satellite Application Facilities. The CM SAF contributes to the
		sustainable observing of the climate system by providing
		Essential Climate Variables related to the energy and water
		cycle of the atmosphere (www.cmsaf.eu). It is a joint
		cooperation of seven National Meteorological and Hydrological
		Services, including the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). The cmsaf
		R-package provides a small collection of R-functions, which are
		inspired by the Climate Data Operators (cdo). This gives the
		opportunity to analyse and manipulate CM SAF data without the
		need of installing cdo. The cmsaf R-package is tested for CM
		SAF netcdf data, which are structured in three-dimensional
		arrays (longitude, latitude, time) on a rectangular grid.
		Layered CM SAF data have to be converted with the provided
		`levbox_mergetime` function. The cmsaf R-package functions have
		only minor checks for deviations from the recommended data
		structure, and give only few specific error messages. Thus,
		there is no warranty of accurate results.
