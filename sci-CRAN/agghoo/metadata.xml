		Aggregated Hold-Out Cross Validation // The 'agghoo' procedure is
		an alternative to usual cross-validation. Instead of choosing
		the best model trained on V subsamples, it determines a winner
		model for each subsample, and then aggregates the V outputs.
		For the details, see "Aggregated hold-out" by Guillaume
		Maillard, Sylvain Arlot, Matthieu Lerasle (2021)
