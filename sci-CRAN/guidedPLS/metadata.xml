		Supervised Dimensional Reduction by Guided Partial Least Squares
		// Guided partial least squares (guided-PLS) is the combination
		of partial least squares by singular value decomposition (PLS-
		SVD) and guided principal component analysis (guided-PCA). This
		package provides implementations of PLS-SVD, guided-PLS, and
		guided-PCA for supervised dimensionality reduction. The guided-
		PCA function (new in v1.1.0) automatically handles mixed data
		types (continuous and categorical) in the supervision matrix
		and provides detailed contribution analysis for
		interpretability. For the details of the methods, see the
		reference section of GitHub README.md
		https://github.com/rikenbit/guidedPLS.
