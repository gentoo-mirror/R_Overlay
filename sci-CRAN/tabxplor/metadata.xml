		User-Friendly Tables with Color Helpers for Data Exploration //
		Make it easy to deal with multiple cross-tables in data
		exploration, by creating them, manipulating them, and adding
		color helpers to highlight important informations (differences
		from totals, comparisons between lines or columns,
		contributions to variance, confidence intervals, odds ratios,
		etc.). All functions are pipe-friendly and render data frames
		which can be easily manipulated. In the same time, time-taking
		operations are done with 'data.table' to go faster with big
		dataframes. Tables can be exported with formats and colors to
		'Excel', plot and html.
