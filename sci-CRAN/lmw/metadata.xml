		Linear Model Weights // Computes the implied weights of linear
		regression models for estimating average causal effects and
		provides diagnostics based on these weights. These diagnostics
		rely on the analyses in Chattopadhyay and Zubizarreta (2022)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asac058 where several regression estimators
		are represented as weighting estimators, in connection to
		inverse probability weighting. 'lmw' provides tools to diagnose
		representativeness, balance, extrapolation, and influence for
		these models, clarifying the target population of inference.
		Tools are also available to simplify estimating treatment
		effects for specific target populations of interest.
