		Design and Analysis of Hierarchical Composite Endpoints //
		Simulate and analyze hierarchical composite endpoints. Includes
		implementation for the kidney hierarchical composite endpoint
		as defined in Heerspink HL et al (2023) Development and
		validation of a new hierarchical composite end point for
		clinical trials of kidney disease progression (Journal of the
		American Society of Nephrology 34 (2): 20252038,
		doi:10.1681/ASN.0000000000000243). Win odds, also called
		Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney or success odds, is the main analysis
		method. Other win statistics (win probability, win ratio, net
		benefit) are also implemented in the univariate case, provided
		there is no censoring. The win probability analysis is based on
		the Brunner-Munzel test and uses the DeLong-DeLong-Clarke-
		Pearson variance estimator, as described by Brunner and
		Konietschke (2025) in An unbiased rank-based estimator of the
		MannWhitney variance including the case of ties (Statistical
		Papers 66 (1): 20, doi:10.1007/s00362-024-01635-0).
		Stratification and covariate adjustment are performed based on
		the methodology presented by Koch GG et al. in Issues for
		covariance analysis of dichotomous and ordered categorical data
		from randomized clinical trials and non-parametric strategies
		for addressing them (Statistics in Medicine 17 (15-16):
		186392). For a review, see Gasparyan SB et al (2021) Adjusted
		win ratio with stratification: Calculation methods and
		interpretation (Statistical Methods in Medical Research 30 (2):
		580611, doi:10.1177/0962280220942558).
