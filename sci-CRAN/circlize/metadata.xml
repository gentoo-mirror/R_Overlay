		Circular Visualization // Circular layout is an efficient way for
		the visualization of huge amounts of information. Here this
		package provides an implementation of circular layout
		generation in R as well as an enhancement of available
		software. The flexibility of the package is based on the usage
		of low-level graphics functions such that self-defined high-
		level graphics can be easily implemented by users for specific
		purposes. Together with the seamless connection between the
		powerful computational and visual environment in R, it gives
		users more convenience and freedom to design figures for better
		understanding complex patterns behind multiple dimensional
		data. The package is described in Gu et al. 2014
