		Bayesian Estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressive Models //
		Provides fast and efficient procedures for Bayesian analysis of
		Structural Vector Autoregressions. This package estimates a
		wide range of models, including homo-, heteroskedastic, and
		non-normal specifications. Structural models can be identified
		by adjustable exclusion restrictions, time-varying volatility,
		or non-normality. They all include a flexible three-level
		equation-specific local-global hierarchical prior distribution
		for the estimated level of shrinkage for autoregressive and
		structural parameters. Additionally, the package facilitates
		predictive and structural analyses such as impulse responses,
		forecast error variance and historical decompositions,
		forecasting, verification of heteroskedasticity, non-normality,
		and hypotheses on autoregressive parameters, as well as
		analyses of structural shocks, volatilities, and fitted values.
		Beautiful plots, informative summary functions, and extensive
		documentation complement all this. The implemented techniques
		align closely with those presented in Ltkepohl, Shang, Uzeda,
		Woniak (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.11057, Ltkepohl  Woniak
		(2020) doi:10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103862, and Song  Woniak (2021)
