		Wrapper for MUMPS Library // Some basic features of MUMPS
		(Multifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) are
		wrapped in a class whose methods can be used for sequentially
		solving a sparse linear system (symmetric or not) with one or
		many right hand sides (dense or sparse). There is a possibility
		to do separately symbolic analysis, LU factorization and system
		solving.
