		Wrapper for MUMPS Library // Some basic features of 'MUMPS'
		(Multifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) are
		wrapped in a class whose methods can be used for sequentially
		solving a sparse linear system (symmetric or not) with one or
		many right hand sides (dense or sparse). There is a possibility
		to do separately symbolic analysis, LU (or LDL^t) factorization
		and system solving. Third part ordering libraries are included
		and can be used: 'PORD', 'METIS', 'SCOTCH'. 'MUMPS' method was
		first described in Amestoy et al. (2001)
		doi:10.1137/S0895479899358194 and Amestoy et al. (2006)
		doi:10.1016/j.parco.2005.07.004.
