		Area Correction Methods // Bird and bat carcasses from wind
		turbines often fall outside of the searched area. To
		compensate, area correction (AC) estimations are calculated to
		estimate the percentage of fatalities that fall within the
		searched area versus those that fall outside of it. This
		package provides two likelihood based methods and one physics
		based method (Hull and Muir (2010)
		doi:10.1080/14486563.2010.9725253) to estimate the carcass fall
		distance distribution. There are also functions for calculating
		the proportion of area searched in one unit annuli, log
		logistic distribution functions, and truncated distribution
		functions.
