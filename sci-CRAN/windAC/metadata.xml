		Area Correction Methods // Post-construction fatality monitoring
		studies at wind facilities are based on data from searches for
		bird and bat carcasses in plots beneath turbines. Bird and bat
		carcasses can fall outside of the search plot. Bird and bat
		carcasses from wind turbines often fall outside of the searched
		area. To compensate, area correction (AC) estimations are
		calculated to estimate the percentage of fatalities that fall
		within the searched area versus those that fall outside of it.
		This package provides two likelihood based methods and one
		physics based method (Hull and Muir (2010)
		doi:10.1080/14486563.2010.9725253, Huso and Dalthorp (2014)
		doi:10.1002/jwmg.663) to estimate the carcass fall
		distribution. There are also functions for calculating the
		proportion of area searched within one unit annuli, log
		logistic distribution functions, and truncated distribution
		functions.
