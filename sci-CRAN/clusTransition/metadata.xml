		Monitor Changes in Cluster Solutions of Dynamic Datasets //
		Monitor and trace changes in clustering solutions of
		accumulating datasets at successive time points. The clusters
		can adopt External and Internal transition at succeeding time
		points. The External transitions comprise of Survived, Merged,
		Split, Disappeared, and newly Emerged candidates. In contrast,
		Internal transition includes changes in location and cohesion
		of the survived clusters. The package uses MONIC framework
		developed by Spiliopoulou, Ntoutsi, Theodoridis, and Schult
		(2006)doi:10.1145/1150402.1150491 .
