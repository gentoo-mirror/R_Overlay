		Learning Graphs from Data via Spectral Constraints // In the era
		of big data and hyperconnectivity, learning high-dimensional
		structures such as graphs from data has become a prominent task
		in machine learning and has found applications in many fields
		such as finance, health care, and networks.
		'spectralGraphTopology' is an open source, documented, and
		well-tested R package for learning graphs from data. It
		provides implementations of state of the art algorithms such as
		Combinatorial Graph Laplacian Learning (CGL), Spectral Graph
		Learning (SGL), Graph Estimation based on Majorization-
		Minimization (GLE-MM), and Graph Estimation based on
		Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (GLE-ADMM). In
		addition, graph learning has been widely employed for
		clustering, where specific algorithms are available in the
		literature. To this end, we provide an implementation of the
		Constrained Laplacian Rank (CLR) algorithm.
