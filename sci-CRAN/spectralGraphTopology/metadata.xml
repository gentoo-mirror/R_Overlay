		Learning Graphs from Data via Spectral Constraints // Block
		coordinate descent estimators to learn k-component, bipartite,
		and k-component bipartite graphs from data by imposing spectral
		constraints on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
		Laplacian and adjacency matrices. Those estimators leverages
		spectral properties of the graphical models as a prior
		information, which turn out to play key roles in unsupervised
		machine learning tasks such as clustering and community
		detection.  This package is based on the paper "A Unified
		Framework for Structured Graph Learning via Spectral
		Constraints" by S. Kumar et al (2019) arXiv:1904.09792.
