		Kernel Based Regression Models // Implements several methods for
		testing the variance component parameter in regression models
		that contain kernel-based random effects, including a maximum
		of adjusted scores test. Several kernels are supported,
		including a profile hidden Markov model mutual information
		kernel for protein sequence. This package is described in Fong
		et al. (2015) DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxu056.
