		Estimate IV-Optimal Individualized Treatment Rules // A method
		that estimates an IV-optimal individualized treatment rule. An
		individualized treatment rule is said to be IV-optimal if it
		minimizes the maximum risk with respect to the putative IV and
		the set of IV identification assumptions. Please refer to
		arXiv:2002.02579 for more details on the methodology and some
		theory underpinning the method. Function IV-PILE() uses
		functions in the package 'locClass'. Package 'locClass' can be
		accessed and installed from the 'R-Forge' repository via the
		following link:
		https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/locclass/.
		Alternatively, one can install the package by entering the
		following in R: 'install.packages("locClass",
		repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")'.
