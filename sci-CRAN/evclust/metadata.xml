		Evidential Clustering // Various clustering algorithms that
		produce a credal partition, i.e., a set of Dempster-Shafer mass
		functions representing the membership of objects to clusters.
		The mass functions quantify the cluster-membership uncertainty
		of the objects. The algorithms are: Evidential c-Means (ECM),
		Relational Evidential c-Means (RECM), Constrained Evidential
		c-Means (CECM), EVCLUS and EK-NNclus.
