		Evidential Clustering // Various clustering algorithms that
		produce a credal partition, i.e., a set of Dempster-Shafer mass
		functions representing the membership of objects to clusters.
		The mass functions quantify the cluster-membership uncertainty
		of the objects. The algorithms are: Evidential c-Means,
		Relational Evidential c-Means, Constrained Evidential c-Means,
		Evidential Clustering, Constrained Evidential Clustering,
		Evidential K-nearest-neighbor-based Clustering, Bootstrap
		Model-Based Evidential Clustering, Belief Peak Evidential
		Clustering, Neural-Network-based Evidential Clustering.
