		Algorithms for Class Distribution Estimation // Quantification is
		a prominent machine learning task that has received an
		increasing amount of attention in the last years. The objective
		is to predict the class distribution of a data sample. This
		package is a collection of machine learning algorithms for
		class distribution estimation. This package include algorithms
		from different paradigms of quantification. These methods are
		described in the paper: A. Maletzke, W. Hassan, D. dos Reis,
		and G. Batista. The importance of the test set size in
		quantification assessment. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth
		International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
		IJCAI20, pages 26402646, 2020. doi:10.24963/ijcai.2020/366.
