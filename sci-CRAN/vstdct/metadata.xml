		Nonparametric Estimation of Toeplitz Covariance Matrices // A
		nonparametric method to estimate Toeplitz covariance matrices
		from a sample of n independently and identically distributed
		p-dimensional vectors with mean zero. The data is preprocessed
		with the discrete cosine matrix and a variance stabilization
		transformation to obtain an approximate Gaussian regression
		setting for the log-spectral density function. Estimates of the
		spectral density function and the inverse of the covariance
		matrix are provided as well. Functions for simulating data and
		a protein data example are included. For details see
		(Klockmann, Krivobokova; 2023), arXiv:2303.10018.
