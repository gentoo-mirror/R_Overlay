		Regularized Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis
		// Methods and tools for implementing regularized multivariate
		functional principal component analysis ('ReMFPCA') for
		multivariate functional data whose variables might be observed
		over different dimensional domains. 'ReMFPCA' is an object-
		oriented interface leveraging the extensibility and scalability
		of R6. It employs a parameter vector to control the smoothness
		of each functional variable. By incorporating smoothness
		constraints as penalty terms within a regularized optimization
		framework, 'ReMFPCA' generates smooth multivariate functional
		principal components, offering a concise and interpretable
		representation of the data. For detailed information on the
		methods and techniques used in 'ReMFPCA', please refer to
		Haghbin et al. (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2306.13980.
