		A Wrapper for Querying KISTERS 'WISKI' Databases via the 'KiWIS'
		API // A wrapper for querying 'WISKI' databases via the 'KiWIS'
		'REST' API. 'WISKI' is an 'SQL' relational database used for
		the collection and storage of water data developed by KISTERS
		and 'KiWIS' is a 'REST' service that provides access to 'WISKI'
		databases via HTTP requests (https://www.kisters.eu/water-
		weather-and-environment/). Contains a list of default databases
		(called 'hubs') and also allows users to provide their own
		'KiWIS' URL. Supports the entire query process- from metadata
		to specific time series values. All data is returned as tidy
		tibbles.
