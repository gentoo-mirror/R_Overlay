		Bayesian Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Models, Including the
		Integrodifference Equation Model // In contrast to other
		methods of modeling spatio-temporal data, dynamic spatio-
		temporal models (DSTMs) directly model the dynamic data-
		generating process. 'ideq' supports two main classes of DSTMs:
		(1) empirical orthogonal function (EOF) models and (2)
		integrodifference equation (IDE) models. EOF models do not
		directly use any spatial information; instead, they make use of
		observed relationships in the data (the principal components)
		to model the underlying process. In contrast, IDE models are
		based on diffusion dynamics and the process evolution is
		governed by a (typically Gaussian) redistribution kernel. Both
		types have a variety of options for specifying the model
		components, including the process matrix, process error, and
		observation error. The classic reference for DSTMs is Noel
		Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle (2011, ISBN:978-0471692744).
		For IDE models specifically, see Christopher K. Wikle and Noel
		Cressie (1999, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673587) and
		Christopher K. Wikle (2002, doi:10.1191/1471082x02st036oa).
