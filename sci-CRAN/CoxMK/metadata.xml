		A Model-X Knockoff Method for Genome-Wide Survival Association
		Analysis // A genome-wide survival framework that integrates
		sequential conditional independent tuples and saddlepoint
		approximation method, to provide SNP-level false discovery rate
		control while improving power, particularly for biobank-scale
		survival analyses with low event rates. The method is based on
		model-X knockoffs as described in Barber and Candes (2015)
		doi:10.1214/15-AOS1337 and fast survival analysis methods from
		Bi et al. (2020) doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.06.003. A shrinkage
		algorithmic leveraging accelerates multiple knockoffs
		generation in large genetic cohorts. This CRAN version uses
		standard Cox regression for association testing. For enhanced
		performance on very large datasets, users may optionally
		install the 'SPACox' package from GitHub which provides
		saddlepoint approximation methods for survival analysis.
