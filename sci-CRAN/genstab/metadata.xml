		Resampling Based Yield Stability Analyses // Several yield
		stability analyses are mentioned in this package: variation and
		regression based yield stability analyses. Resampling
		techniques are integrated with these stability analyses. The
		function stab.mean() provides the genotypic means and ranks
		including their corresponding confidence intervals. The
		function stab.var() provides the genotypic variances over
		environments including their corresponding confidence
		intervals. The function stab.fw() is an extended method from
		the Finlay-Wilkinson method (1963). This method can include
		several other factors that might impact yield stability.
		Resampling technique is integrated into this method. A few
		missing data points or unbalanced data are allowed too. The
		function stab.fw.check() is an extended method from the Finlay-
		Wilkinson method (1963). The yield stability is evaluated via
		common check line(s). Resampling technique is integrated.
