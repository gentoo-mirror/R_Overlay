		Modelling Interactions in High-Dimensional Data with Backtracking
		// Implementation of the algorithm introduced in Shah, R. D.
		(2016) http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/13-515/13-515.pdf.
		Data with thousands of predictors can be handled. The algorithm
		performs sequential Lasso fits on design matrices containing
		increasing sets of candidate interactions. Previous fits are
		used to greatly speed up subsequent fits so the algorithm is
		very efficient.
