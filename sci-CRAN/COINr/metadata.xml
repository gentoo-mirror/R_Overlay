		Composite Indicator Construction and Analysis // A comprehensive
		high-level package for composite indicator construction and
		analysis. It is a "development environment" for composite
		indicators and scoreboards, which includes utilities for
		construction (indicator selection, denomination, imputation,
		data treatment, normalisation, weighting and aggregation) and
		analysis (multivariate analysis, correlation plotting, short
		cuts for principle component analysis, global sensitivity
		analysis, and more). A composite indicator is completely
		encapsulated inside a single hierarchical list called a "COIN".
		This allows a fast and efficient work flow, as well as making
		quick copies, testing methodological variations and making
		comparisons. It also includes many plotting options, both
		statistical (scatter plots, distribution plots) as well as for
		presenting results (maps, bar charts, radar charts, and more).
		Finally, three Shiny apps are available which enable fast data
		exploration, results presentation, and checking the effects of
		altering weights. Full documentation is found in the online
		book at https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/, as well as the
		vignette.
