		Bayesian Analysis of the Network Autocorrelation Model // The
		network autocorrelation model (NAM) can be used for studying
		the degree of social influence regarding an outcome variable
		based on one or more known networks. The degree of social
		influence is quantified via the network autocorrelation
		parameters. In case of a single network, the Bayesian methods
		of Dittrich, Leenders, and Mulder (2017)
		DOI:10.1016/j.socnet.2016.09.002 and Dittrich, Leenders, and
		Mulder (2019) DOI:10.1177/0049124117729712 are implemented
		using a normal, flat, or independence Jeffreys prior for the
		network autocorrelation. In the case of multiple networks, the
		Bayesian methods of Dittrich, Leenders, and Mulder (2020)
		DOI:10.1177/0081175020913899 are implemented using a
		multivariate normal prior for the network autocorrelation
		parameters. Flat priors are implemented for estimating the
		coefficients. For Bayesian testing of equality and order-
		constrained hypotheses, the default Bayes factor of Gu, Mulder,
		and Hoijtink, (2018) DOI:10.1111/bmsp.12110 is used with the
		posterior mean and posterior covariance matrix of the NAM
		parameters based on flat priors as input.
