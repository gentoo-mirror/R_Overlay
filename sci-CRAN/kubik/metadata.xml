		Cubic Hermite Splines // Computes (constructs, plots and
		evaluates) constrained cubic Hermite splines, which can be used
		to construct monotonic splines. Computes their first
		derivatives, indefinite integrals and smooth approximations of
		their first, second and higher derivatives. Also, computes
		their roots, including their argmins, argmaxs and inflection
		points.
