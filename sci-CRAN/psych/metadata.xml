		Procedures for Psychological, Psychometric, and Personality
		Research // A general purpose toolbox developed orginally for
		personality, psychometric theory and experimental psychology.
		Functions are primarily for multivariate analysis and scale
		construction using factor analysis, principal component
		analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although
		others provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response
		Theory is done using  factor analysis of tetrachoric and
		polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data at
		multiple levels include within and between group statistics,
		including correlations and factor analysis.  Validation and
		cross validation of scales developed using basic machine
		learning algorithms are provided, as are functions for
		simulating and testing particular item and test structures.
		Several functions  serve as a useful front end for structural
		equation modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams,
		including mediation models, factor analysis and structural
		equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the
		functions are written to support a book on psychometric theory
		as well as publications in personality research. For more
		information, see the https://personality-project.org/r/ web
		page.
