		Sample Size Calculation under Non-Proportional Hazards //
		Performs combination tests and sample size calculation for
		fixed design with survival endpoints using combination tests
		under either proportional hazards or non-proportional hazards.
		The combination tests include maximum weighted log-rank test
		and projection test. The sample size calculation procedure is
		very flexible, allowing for user-defined hazard ratio function
		and considering various trial conditions like staggered entry,
		drop-out etc. The sample size calculation also applies to
		various cure models such as proportional hazards cure model,
		cure model with (random) delayed treatments effects. Trial
		simulation function is also provided to facilitate the
		empirical power calculation. The references for projection test
		and maximum weighted logrank test include Brendel et al. (2014)
