		Credit Scoring Tools // Grouping essential tools for credit
		scoring. These statistical tools may be useful for other use-
		cases as well but were primarily designed for it. First, there
		are Reject Inference methods (Ehrhardt et al. (2017)
		arXiv:1903.10855). Second, we build upon the already CRAN-
		available package 'discretization' to automate discretization
		of continuous features.
