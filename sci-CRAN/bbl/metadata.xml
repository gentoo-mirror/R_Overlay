		Boltzmann Bayes Learner // Supervised learning using Boltzmann
		Bayes model inference, which extends naive Bayes model to
		include interactions. Enables classification of data into
		multiple response groups based on a large number of discrete
		predictors that can take factor values of heterogeneous levels.
		Either pseudo-likelihood or mean field inference can be used
		with L2 regularization, cross-validation, and prediction on new
		data. Woo et al. (2016) doi:10.1186/s12864-016-2871-3.
