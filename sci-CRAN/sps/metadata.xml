		Sequential Poisson Sampling // Sequential Poisson sampling is a
		variation of Poisson sampling for drawing probability-
		proportional-to-size samples with a given number of units, and
		is commonly used for price-index surveys. This package gives
		functions to draw stratified sequential Poisson samples
		according to the method by Ohlsson (1998, ISSN:0282-423X), as
		well as other order sample designs by Rosn (1997,
		doi:10.1016/S0378-3758(96)00186-3), and generate appropriate
		bootstrap replicate weights according to the generalized
		bootstrap method by Beaumont and Patak (2012,
		doi:10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00166.x).
