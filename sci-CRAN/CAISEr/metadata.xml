		Comparison of Algorithms with Iterative Sample Size Estimation //
		Functions for performing experimental comparisons of algorithms
		using adequate sample sizes for power and accuracy. Implements
		the methodology originally presented in Campelo and Takahashi
		(2019) doi:10.1007/s10732-018-9396-7 for the comparison of two
		algorithms, and later generalised in Campelo and Wanner
		(Submitted, 2019) arxiv:1908.01720.
