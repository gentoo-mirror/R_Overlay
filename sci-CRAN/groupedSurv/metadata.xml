		Efficient Estimation of Grouped Survival Models // These
		'Rcpp'-based functions compute the efficient score statistics
		for grouped time-to-event data (Prentice and Gloeckler, 1978),
		with the optional inclusion of baseline covariates. Functions
		for estimating the parameter of interest and nuisance
		parameters, including baseline hazards, using maximum
		likelihood are also provided. A parallel set of functions allow
		for the incorporation of family structure of related
		individuals (e.g., trios). Note that the current implementation
		of the frailty model (Ripatti and Palmgren, 2000) is sensitive
		to departures from model assumptions, and should be considered
		experimental. For these data, the exact proportional-hazards-
		model-based likelihood is computed by evaluating multiple
		variable integration. The integration is accomplished using the
		'Cuba' library (Hahn, 2005), and the source files are included
		in this package. The maximization process is carried out using
		Brent's algorithm, with the C++ code file from John Burkardt
		and John Denker (Brent, 2002).
