		Efficient Estimation of Grouped Survival Models Using the Exact
		Likelihood Function // The core of this 'Rcpp'-based package is
		a set of functions to compute the efficient score statistics
		for grouped survival models. The functions are designed to
		analyze grouped time-to-event data with the optional inclusion
		of either baseline covariates or family structure of related
		individuals (e.g., trios). Functions for estimating the
		baseline hazards, frailty variance, nuisance parameters, and
		fixed effects are also provided. The functions encompass two
		processes for discrete-time shared frailty model data with
		random effects: (1) evaluation of the multiple variable
		integration to compute the exact proportional-hazards-model-
		based likelihood and (2) estimation of the desired parameters
		using maximum likelihood. For data without family structure,
		only the latter step is performed. The integration is evaluated
		by the 'Cuhre' algorithm from the 'Cuba' library (Hahn, T.
		(2005). Cuba-a library for multidimensional numerical
		integration, Comput. Phys. Commun. 168, 78-95
		doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2005.01.010), and the source files of the
		'Cuhre' function are included in this package. The maximization
		process is carried out using Brent's algorithm, with the 'C++'
		code file from John Burkardt and John Denker (Brent, R.,
		Algorithms for Minimization without Derivatives, Dover, 2002,
		ISBN 0-486-41998-3).
