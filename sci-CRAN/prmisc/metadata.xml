		Miscellaneous Printing of Numeric and Statistical Output in R
		Markdown and Quarto Documents // Miscellaneous printing of
		numeric or statistical results in R Markdown or Quarto
		documents according to guidelines of the "Publication Manual"
		of the American Psychological Association (2020, ISBN:
		978-1-4338-3215-4). These guidelines are usually referred to as
		APA style (https://apastyle.apa.org/) and include specific
		rules on the formatting of numbers and statistical test
		results. APA style has to be implemented when submitting
		scientific reports in a wide range of research fields,
		especially in the social sciences. The default output of
		numbers in the R console or R Markdown and Quarto documents
		does not meet the APA style requirements, and reformatting
		results manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. This
		package covers the automatic conversion of R objects to textual
		representations that meet the APA style requirements, which can
		be included in R Markdown or Quarto documents. It covers some
		basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-
		squared test, Wilcoxon test) as well as some basic number
		printing manipulations (formatting p-values, removing leading
		zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one, and others).
		Other packages exist for formatting numbers and tests according
		to the APA style guidelines, such as 'papaja'
		(https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja) and 'apa'
		(https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa), but they do not offer
		all convenience functionality included in 'prmisc'. The
		vignette has an overview of most of the functions included in
		the package.
