		Simulate Survival Data for Randomized Clinical Trials // A system
		to simulate clinical trials with time to event endpoints. Event
		simulation is based on Cox models allowing for covariates in
		addition to the treatment or group factor. Specific drop-out
		rates (separate from administrative censoring) can be
		controlled in the simulation. Other features include stratified
		randomization, non-proportional hazards, different accrual
		patterns, and event projection (timing to reach the target
		event) based on interim data.
