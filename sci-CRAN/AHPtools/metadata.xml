		Consistency in the Analytic Hierarchy Process // A set of three
		functions for 'AHP' users, namely CR() which evaluates the
		Consistency Ratio for a given 'PCM', improveCR() for any input
		'PCM' suggests a matrix with preferences similar to the
		original preferences, having greater consistency than the input
		matrix and sensitivity() for an input 'PCM' returns the average
		rank correlation of the principal eigenvector of the input
		'PCM' and of 500 sample matrices generated by random
		perturbations of elements of the input matrix to within the
		five nearest elements in the Fundamental Scale.
