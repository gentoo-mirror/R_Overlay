		Consistency in the Analytic Hierarchy Process // A Swiss Army
		knife of utility functions for users of the Analytic Hierarchy
		Process (AHP) which will help you to assess the consistency of
		a PCM as well as to improve its consistency ratio, to compute
		the sensitivity of a PCM, create a logical (as distinct from a
		random PCM) from preferences provided for the alternatives, and
		a function that helps evaluate the actual consistency of a PCM
		based on objective, fair bench marking. The various functions
		in the toolkit additionally provide the flexibility to users to
		specify only the upper triangular comparison ratios of the PCM
		in order to performs its assigned task.
