		Consistency in the Analytic Hierarchy Process // A Swiss Army
		knife of utility functions for AHP users which will help you
		assess the consistency of a PCM as well as improve the
		consistency ratio, compute the sensitivity of a PCM, create a
		logical, not a random PCM, from the preferences you provide for
		the alternatives, and a function that helps evaluate the actual
		consistency of a PCM based on objective, fair bench marking.
		The toolkit additionally allows a user to specify only the
		upper triangular comparison ratios of the PCM and performs its
		assigned task.
