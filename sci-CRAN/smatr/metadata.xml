		(Standardised) Major Axis Estimation and Testing Routines //
		Methods for fitting bivariate lines in allometry using the
		major axis (MA) or standardised major axis (SMA), and for
		making inferences about such lines. The available methods of
		inference include confidence intervals and one-sample tests for
		slope and elevation, testing for a common slope or elevation
		amongst several allometric lines, constructing a confidence
		interval for a common slope or elevation, and testing for no
		shift along a common axis, amongst several samples. See Warton
		et al. 2012 doi:10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00153.x for methods
