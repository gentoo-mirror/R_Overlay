		Learning Discrete Bayesian Network Classifiers from Data //
		Implements state-of-the art algorithms for learning discrete
		Bayesian network classifiers from data, including a number of
		those described in Bielza  Larranaga (2014)
		doi:10.1145/2576868, as well as functions for using these
		classifiers for prediction, assessing their predictive
