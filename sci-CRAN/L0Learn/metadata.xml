		Fast Algorithms for Best Subset Selection // Highly optimized
		toolkit for approximately solving L0-regularized learning
		problems (a.k.a. best subset selection). The algorithms are
		based on coordinate descent and local combinatorial search. For
		more details, check the paper by Hazimeh and Mazumder (2020)
