		A Generic Convex-Hull-Based Model Selection Method // Given a set
		of models for which a measure of model (mis)fit and model
		complexity is provided, CHull(), developed by Ceulemans and
		Kiers (2006) doi:10.1348/000711005X64817, determines the models
		that are located on the boundary of the convex hull and selects
		an optimal model by means of the scree test values.
