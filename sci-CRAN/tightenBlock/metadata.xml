		Tightens an Observational Block Design by Balanced Subset
		Matching // Tightens an observational block design into a
		smaller design with either smaller or fewer blocks while
		controlling for covariates. The method uses fine balance,
		optimal subset matching (Rosenbaum, 2012
		doi:10.1198/jcgs.2011.09219) and two-criteria matching (Zhang
		et al 2023 doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1981337).  The main
		function is tighten().  The suggested 'rrelaxiv' package for
		solving minimum cost flow problems: (i) derives from Bertsekas
		and Tseng (1988) doi:10.1007/BF02288322, (ii) is not available
		on CRAN due to its academic license, (iii) may be downloaded
		from GitHub at https://github.com/josherrickson/rrelaxiv/, (iv)
		is not essential to use the package.
