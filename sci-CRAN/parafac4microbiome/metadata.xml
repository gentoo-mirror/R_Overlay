		Parallel Factor Analysis Modelling of Longitudinal Microbiome
		Data // Creation and selection of PARAllel FACtor Analysis
		(PARAFAC) models of longitudinal microbiome data. You can
		import your own data with our import functions or use one of
		the example datasets to create your own PARAFAC models.
		Selection of the optimal number of components can be done using
		assessModelQuality() and assessModelStability(). The selected
		model can then be plotted using plotPARAFACmodel(). The
		Parallel Factor Analysis method was originally described by
		Caroll and Chang (1970) doi:10.1007/BF02310791 and Harshman
		(1970)
