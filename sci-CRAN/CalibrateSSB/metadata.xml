		Weighting and Estimation for Panel Data with Non-Response //
		Functions to calculate weights, estimates of changes and
		corresponding variance estimates for panel data with non-
		response. Partially overlapping samples are handled. Initially,
		weights are calculated by linear calibration. By default, the
		survey package is used for this purpose. It is also possible to
		use ReGenesees, which can be installed from
		https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees. Variances of
		linear combinations (changes and averages) and ratios are
		calculated from a covariance matrix based on residuals
		according to the calibration model. The methodology was
		presented at the conference, The Use of R in Official
		Statistics, and is described in Langsrud (2016)
