		Web Scraping and Bibliometric Analysis of MDPI Journals //
		Provides comprehensive tools to scrape and analyze data from
		the MDPI journals. It allows users to extract metrics such as
		submission-to-acceptance times, article types, and whether
		articles are part of special issues. The package can also
		visualize this information through plots. Additionally,
		'MDPIexploreR' offers tools to explore patterns of self-
		citations within articles and provides insights into guest-
		edited special issues.
