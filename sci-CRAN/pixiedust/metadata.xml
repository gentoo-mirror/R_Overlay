		Tables so Beautifully Fine-Tuned You Will Believe It's Magic //
		The introduction of the broom package has made converting model
		objects into data frames as simple as a single function.  While
		the broom package focuses on providing tidy data frames that
		can be used in advanced analysis, it deliberately stops short
		of providing functionality for reporting models in publication-
		ready tables.  pixiedust provides this functionality with a
		programming interface intended to be similar to ggplot2's
		system of layers with fine tuned control over each cell of the
		table.  Options for output include printing to the console and
		to the common markdown formats (markdown, HTML, and LaTeX).
		With a little pixiedust (and happy thoughts) tables can really
		fly.
