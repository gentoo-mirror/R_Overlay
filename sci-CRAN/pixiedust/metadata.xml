		Tables so Beautifully Fine-Tuned You Will Believe It's Magic //
		The introduction of the 'broom' package has made converting
		model objects into data frames as simple as a single function.
		While the 'broom' package focuses on providing tidy data frames
		that can be used in advanced analysis, it deliberately stops
		short of providing functionality for reporting models in
		publication-ready tables. 'pixiedust' provides this
		functionality with a programming interface intended to be
		similar to 'ggplot2's system of layers with fine tuned control
		over each cell of the table. Options for output include
		printing to the console and to the common markdown formats
		(markdown, HTML, and LaTeX). With a little 'pixiedust' (and
		happy thoughts) tables can really fly.
