		Create (Advanced) Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorization Models
		// Creation and selection of (Advanced) Coupled Matrix and
		Tensor Factorization (ACMTF) and ACMTF-Regression (ACMTF-R)
		models. Selection of the optimal number of components can be
		done using 'ACMTF_modelSelection()' and
		'ACMTFR_modelSelection()'. The CMTF and ACMTF methods were
		originally described by Acar et al., 2011
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1105.3422 and Acar et al., 2014
		doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-239, respectively.
