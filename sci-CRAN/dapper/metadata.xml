		Data Augmentation for Private Posterior Estimation // A data
		augmentation based sampler for conducting privacy-aware
		Bayesian inference. The dapper_sample() function takes an
		existing sampler as input and automatically constructs a
		privacy-aware sampler. The process of constructing a sampler is
		simplified through the specification of four independent
		modules, allowing for easy comparison between different privacy
		mechanisms by only swapping out the relevant modules.
		Probability mass functions for the discrete Gaussian and
		discrete Laplacian are provided to facilitate analyses dealing
		with privatized count data. The output of dapper_sample() can
		be analyzed using many of the same tools from the `rstan`
		ecosystem. For methodological details on the sampler see Ju et
		al. (2022) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2206.00710, and for details on
		the discrete Gaussian and discrete Laplacian distributions see
		Canonne et al. (2020) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2004.00010.
