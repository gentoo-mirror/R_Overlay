		High Performance, Low Friction Large Language Model Chat //
		Introduces a 'Copilot'-like completion experience, but it knows
		how to talk to the objects in your R environment. 'ellmer'
		chats are integrated directly into your 'RStudio' and
		'Positron' sessions, automatically incorporating relevant
		context from surrounding lines of code and your global
		environment (like data frame columns and types). Open the
		package dialog box with a keyboard shortcut, type your request,
		and the assistant will stream its response directly into your
		documents.
