		Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture by Inverse Prediction //
		Estimates the density of a spatially distributed animal
		population sampled with an array of passive detectors, such as
		traps. Models incorporating distance-dependent detection are
		fitted by simulation and inverse prediction as proposed by
