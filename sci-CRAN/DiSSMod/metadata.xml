		Fitting Sample Selection Models for Discrete Response Variables
		// Tools to fit sample selection models in case of discrete
		response variables, through a parametric formulation which
		represents a natural extension of the well-known Heckman
		selection model are provided in the package. The response
		variable can be of Bernoulli, Poisson or Negative Binomial
		type. The sample selection mechanism allows to choose among a
		Normal, Logistic or Gumbel distribution.
