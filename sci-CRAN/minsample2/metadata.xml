		The Minimum Sample Size // Using this package, one can determine
		the minimum sample size required so that the mean square error
		of the sample mean and the population mean of a distribution
		becomes less than some pre-determined epsilon, i.e. it helps
		the user to determine the minimum sample size required to
		attain the pre-fixed precision level by minimizing the
		difference between the sample mean and population mean.
