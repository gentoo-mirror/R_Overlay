		Utilities for Aggregating Probabilistic Forecasts // Provides
		several methods for aggregating probabilistic forecasts. You
		have a group of people who have made probabilistic forecasts
		for the same event. You want to take advantage of the "wisdom
		of the crowd" and combine these forecasts in some sensible way.
		This package provides implementations of several strategies,
		including geometric mean of odds, an extremized aggregate
		(Neyman, Roughgarden (2021) doi:10.1145/3490486.3538243), and
		"high-density trimmed mean" (Powell et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1037/dec0000191).
