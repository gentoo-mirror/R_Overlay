		Delinate Region of Interests (ROI's) and Extract Time-Series Data
		from Digital Repeat Photography Images // Digital repeat
		photography and near-surface remote sensing have been used by
		environmental scientists to study the environmental change for
		nearly a decade. However, a user-friendly, reliable, and robust
		platform to extract color-based statistics and time-series from
		a large stack of images is still lacking. Here, we present an
		interactive open-source toolkit, called 'xROI', that facilitate
		the process time-series extraction and improve the quality of
		the final data. 'xROI' provides a responsive environment for
		scientists to interactively a) delineate regions of interest
		(ROI), b) handle field of view (FOV) shifts, and c) extract and
		export time series data characterizing image color (i.e. red,
		green and blue channel digital numbers for the defined ROI).
		Using 'xROI', user can detect FOV shifts without minimal
		difficulty. The software gives user the opportunity to readjust
		the mask files or redraw new ones every time an FOV shift
		occurs. 'xROI' helps to significantly improve data accuracy and
		continuity.
