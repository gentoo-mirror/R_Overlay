		Spatial Crop Water Demand for Brazil // Estimation of crop water
		demand can be processed via this package. As example, the data
		from 'TerraClimate' dataset
		(https://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html) calibrated
		with automatic weather stations of National Meteorological
		Institute of Brazil is available in a coarse spatial resolution
		to do the crop water demand. However, the user have also the
		option to download the variables directly from 'TerraClimate'
		repository with the download.terraclimate function  and access
		the original 'TerraClimate' products. If the user believes that
		is necessary calibrate the variables, there is another function
		to do it. Lastly, the estimation of the crop water demand
		present in this package can be run for all the Brazilian
		territory with 'TerraClimate' dataset.
