		Blind Source Separation Methods Based on Joint Diagonalization
		and Some BSS Performance Criteria // Cardoso's JADE algorithm
		as well as his functions for joint diagonalization are ported
		to R. Also several other blind source separation (BSS) methods,
		like AMUSE and SOBI, and some criteria for performance
		evaluation of BSS algorithms, are given. The package is
		described in Miettinen, Nordhausen and Taskinen (2017)
