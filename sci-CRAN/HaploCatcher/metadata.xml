		A Predictive Haplotyping Package // Used for predicting a
		genotypes allelic state at a specific locus/QTL/gene. This is
		accomplished by using both a genotype matrix and a separate
		file which has categorizations about loci/QTL/genes of interest
		for the individuals in the genotypic matrix. A training
		population can be created from a panel of individuals who have
		been previously screened for specific loci/QTL/genes, and this
		previous screening could be summarized into a category. Using
		the categorization of individuals which have been genotyped
		using a genome wide marker platform, a model can be trained to
		predict what category (haplotype) an individual belongs in
		based on their genetic sequence in the region associated with
		the locus/QTL/gene. These trained models can then be used to
		predict the haplotype of a locus/QTL/gene for individuals which
		have been genotyped with a genome wide platform yet not
		genotyped for the specific locus/QTL/gene. This package is
		based off work done by Winn et al 2021. For more specific
		information on this method, refer to
		doi:10.1007/s00122-022-04178-w.
