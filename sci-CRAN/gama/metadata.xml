		Genetic Approach to Maximize Clustering Criterion // An
		evolutionary approach to performing hard partitional
		clustering. The algorithm uses genetic operators guided by
		information about the quality of individual partitions. The
		method looks for the best barycenters/centroids configuration
		(encoded as real-value) to maximize or minimize one of the
		given clustering validation criteria: Silhouette, Dunn Index,
		C-Index or Calinski-Harabasz Index. As many other clustering
		algorithms, 'gama' asks for k: a fixed a priori established
		number of partitions. If the user does not know the best value
		for k, the algorithm estimates it by using one of two user-
		specified options: minimum or broad. The first method uses an
		approximation of the second derivative of a set of points to
		automatically detect the maximum curvature (the 'elbow') in the
		within-cluster sum of squares error (WCSSE) graph. The second
		method estimates the best k value through majority voting of 24
		indices. One of the major advantages of 'gama' is to introduce
		a bias to detect partitions which attend a particular
		criterion. References: Scrucca, L. (2013)
