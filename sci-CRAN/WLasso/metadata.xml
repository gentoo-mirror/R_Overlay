		Variable Selection for Highly Correlated Predictors // It
		proposes a novel variable selection approach taking into
		account the correlations that may exist between the predictors
		of the design matrix in a high-dimensional linear model. Our
		approach consists in rewriting the initial high-dimensional
		linear model to remove the correlation between the predictors
		and in applying the generalized Lasso criterion. For further
		details we refer the reader to the paper arXiv:2007.10768 (Zhu
		et al., 2020).
