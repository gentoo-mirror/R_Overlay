		Proximate Composition Analysis of Fish and Feed Ingredients //
		The proximate composition analysis is the quantification of
		main components that constitutes nutritional profile of any
		food and food products including fish, shellfish, fish feed and
		their ingredients. Understanding this composition is essential
		for evaluating their nutritional value and for making informed
		dietary choices. The primary components typically analyzed
		include; moisture/ water in foods, crude protein, crude fat/
		lipid, total ash, fiber and carbohydrates
		AOAC(2005,ISBN:0-935584-77-3). In case of fish, shellfish and
		its products, the proximate composition consists of four
		primary constituents - water, protein, fat, and ash (mostly
		minerals). Fish exhibit significant variation in their chemical
		makeup based on age, sex, environment, and season, both within
		the same species and between individual fish. There is minimal
		fluctuation in the content of ash and protein. The lipid
		concentration varies remarkably and is inversely correlated
		with the water content. In case of fish, carbohydrates are
		present in minor quantity so that are quantified by subtracting
		total of other components from 100 to get percentage of
		carbohydrates.
