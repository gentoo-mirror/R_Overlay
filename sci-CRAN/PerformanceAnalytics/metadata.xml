		Econometric Tools for Performance and Risk Analysis // Collection
		of econometric functions for performance and risk analysis.
		This package aims to aid practitioners and researchers in
		utilizing the latest research in analysis of non-normal return
		streams.  In general, it is most tested on return (rather than
		price) data on a regular scale, but most functions will work
		with irregular return data as well, and increasing numbers of
		functions will work with PL or price data where possible.
