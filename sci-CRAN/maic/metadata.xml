		Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison // A generalised workflow
		for generation of subject weights to be used in Matching-
		Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) per Signorovitch et al.
		(2012) doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.05.004, Signorovitch et al
		(2010) doi:10.2165/11538370-000000000-00000. In MAIC, unbiased
		comparison between outcomes of two trials is facilitated by
		weighting the subject-level outcomes of one trial with weights
		derived such that the weighted aggregate measures of the
		prognostic or effect modifying variables are equal to those of
		the sample in the comparator trial. The functions and classes
		included in this package wrap and abstract the process
		demonstrated in the UK National Institute for Health and Care
		Excellence Decision Support Unit (NICE DSU)'s example
		(Phillippo et al, (2016) [see URL]), providing a repeatable and
		easily specifiable workflow for producing multiple comparison
		variable sets against a variety of target studies, with
		preprocessing for a number of aggregate target forms (e.g.
		mean, median, domain limits).
