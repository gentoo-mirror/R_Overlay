		Penalized Multi-Band Learning for Circadian Rhythm Analysis Using
		Actigraphy // Penalized Multi-Band Learning algorithm can be
		effectively implemented for circadian rhythm analysis and daily
		activity pattern characterization using actigraphy
		(continuously measured objective physical activity data).
		Functions for interactive visualization of actigraph data are
		also included. Method reference: Li, X., Kane, M., Zhang, Y.,
