		Estimating Remaining Useful Life with Linear Mixed Effects Models
		// Provides tools for estimating the Remaining Useful Life
		(RUL) of degrading systems using linear mixed-effects models
		and creating a health index. It supports both univariate and
		multivariate degradation signals. For multivariate inputs, the
		signals are merged into a univariate health index prior to
		modeling. Linear and exponential degradation trajectories are
		supported (the latter using a log transformation). Remaining
		Useful Life (RUL) distributions are estimated using Bayesian
		updating for new units, enabling on-site predictive
		maintenance. Based on the methodology of Liu and Huang (2016)
