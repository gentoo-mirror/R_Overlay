		Seed Vigor Index // Seed vigor is defined as the sum total of
		those properties of the seed which determine the level of
		activity and performance of the seed or seed lot during
		germination and seedling emergence.  Testing for vigor becomes
		more important for carryover seeds, especially if seeds were
		stored under unknown conditions or under unfavorable storage
		conditions. Seed vigor testing is also used as indicator of the
		storage potential of a seed lot and in ranking various seed
		lots with different qualities. The vigour index is calculated
		using the equation given by (Ling et al. 2014)
