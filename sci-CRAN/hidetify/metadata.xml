		Identify Influential Observations in High Dimension // Efficient
		tool for identifying influential observations in high
		dimensional linear regression. The tool implements two
		detection techniques single detection (Barry et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1080/03610926.2020.1841793) and multiple detection
		(Barry et al. (2021) arXiv:2105.12286).  The single detection
		is an adaptation of Cook's measure for high dimensional data.
		The method relies on the concept of expectile to construct an
		influence measure based on asymmetric correlations. The
		multiple detection technique applies a group deletion procedure
		to build the algorithm on three main steps. The first stage
		applies an ultra conservative score to mitigate the swamping
		effect, the second stage uses the clean sample generated in the
		previous stage and applies an aggressive score to attenuate the
		masking phenomenon. Finally, the last step is concerned with
		the validation of the influential set generated by the two
		previous steps. The main functions take a response variable and
		a design matrix as input and output a set of potential
		influential observations.
