		Stagewise Generalized Estimating Equations // Stagewise
		techniques implemented with Generalized Estimating Equations to
		handle individual, group, bi-level, and interaction selection.
		Stagewise approaches start with an empty model and slowly build
		the model over several iterations, which yields a 'path' of
		candidate models from which model selection can be performed.
		This 'slow brewing' approach gives stagewise techniques a
		unique flexibility that allows simple incorporation of
		Generalized Estimating Equations; see Vaughan, G., Aseltine,
		R., Chen, K., Yan, J., (2017) doi:10.1111/biom.12669 for
		details.
