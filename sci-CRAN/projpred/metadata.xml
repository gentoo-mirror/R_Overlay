		predictive feature selection for generalized linear and
		additive models as well as for generalized linear and additive
		multilevel models (see Piironen, Paasiniemi and Vehtari, 2020,
		doi:10.1214/20-EJS1711; Catalina, Brkner and Vehtari, 2022,
		https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/catalina22a.html). The
