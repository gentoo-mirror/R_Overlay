		Projection Predictive Feature Selection // Performs projection
		predictive feature selection for generalized linear models
		(Piironen, Paasiniemi, and Vehtari, 2020,
		doi:10.1214/20-EJS1711) with or without multilevel or additive
		terms (Catalina, Brkner, and Vehtari, 2022,
		https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/catalina22a.html), for some
		ordinal and nominal regression models (Weber and Vehtari, 2023,
		arXiv:2301.01660), and for many other regression models (using
		the latent projection by Catalina, Brkner, and Vehtari, 2021,
		arXiv:2109.04702, which can also be applied to most of the
		former models). The package is compatible with the 'rstanarm'
		and 'brms' packages, but other reference models can also be
		used. See the vignettes and the documentation for more
		information and examples.
