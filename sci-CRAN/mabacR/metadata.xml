		Assisting Decision Makers // Easy implementation of the MABAC
		multi-criteria decision method, that was introduced by Pamuar
		and irovi in the work entitled: "The selection of transport and
		handling resources in logistics centers using Multi-Attributive
		Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC)" -
		doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2014.11.057 - which aimed to choose
		implements for logistics centers. This package receives data,
		preferably in a spreadsheet, reads it and applies the
		mathematical algorithms inherent to the MABAC method to
		generate a ranking with the optimal solution according to the
		established criteria, weights and type of criteria. The data
		will be normalized, weighted by the weights, the border area
		will be determined, the distances to this border area will be
		calculated and finally a ranking with the optimal option will
		be generated.
