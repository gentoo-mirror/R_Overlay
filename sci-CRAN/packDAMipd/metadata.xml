		Decision Analysis Modelling Package with Parameters Estimation
		Ability from Individual Patient Level Data // A collection of
		functions to construct Markov model for model-based cost-
		effectiveness analysis. This includes creating Markov model
		(both time homogenous and time dependent models), decision
		analysis, sensitivity analysis (deterministic and
		probabilistic). The package allows estimation of parameters for
		the Markov model from a given individual patient level data,
		provided the data file follows some standard data entry rules.
