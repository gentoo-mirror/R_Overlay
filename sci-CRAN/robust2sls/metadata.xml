		Outlier Robust Two-Stage Least Squares Inference and Testing //
		An implementation of easy tools for outlier robust inference in
		two-stage least squares (2SLS) models. The user specifies a
		reference distribution against which observations are
		classified as outliers or not. After removing the outliers,
		adjusted standard errors are automatically provided.
		Furthermore, several statistical tests for the false outlier
		detection rate can be calculated. The outlier removing
		algorithm can be iterated a fixed number of times or until the
		procedure converges. The algorithms and robust inference are
		described in more detail in Jiao (2019) https://drive.google.co
		m/file/d/1qPxDJnLlzLqdk94X9wwVASptf1MPpI2w/view.
