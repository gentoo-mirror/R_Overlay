		Group Sequential Designs of Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Trials // It
		provides functions to generate operating characteristics and to
		calculate Sequential Conditional Probability Ratio Tests(SCPRT)
		efficacy and futility boundary values along with sample/event
		size of Multi-Arm Multi-Stage(MAMS) trials for different
		outcomes. The package is based on Jianrong Wu, Yimei Li, Liang
		Zhu (2023) doi:10.1002/sim.9682, Jianrong Wu, Yimei Li (2023)
		"Group Sequential Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Survival Trial Design
		with Treatment Selection"(Manuscript accepted for publication)
		and Jianrong Wu, Yimei Li, Shengping Yang (2023) "Group
		Sequential Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Trial Design with Ordinal
		Endpoints"(In preparation).
