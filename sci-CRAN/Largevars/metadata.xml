		Testing Large VARs for the Presence of Cointegration // Conducts
		a cointegration test for high-dimensional vector
		autoregressions (VARs) of order k based on the large N,T
		asymptotics of Bykhovskaya and Gorin, 2022
		(doi:10.48550/arXiv.2202.07150). The implemented test is a
		modification of the Johansen likelihood ratio test. In the
		absence of cointegration the test converges to the partial sum
		of the Airy-1 point process. This package contains simulated
		quantiles of the first ten partial sums of the Airy-1 point
		process that are precise up to the first three digits.
