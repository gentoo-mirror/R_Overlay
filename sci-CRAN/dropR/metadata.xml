		Dropout Analysis by Condition // Analysis and visualization of
		dropout between conditions in surveys and (online) experiments.
		Features include computation of dropout statistics, comparing
		dropout between conditions (e.g. Chi square), analyzing
		survival (e.g. Kaplan-Meier estimation), comparing conditions
		with the most different rates of dropout (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
		and visualizing the result of each in designated plotting
		functions. Sources: Andrea Frick, Marie-Terese Baechtiger  Ulf-
