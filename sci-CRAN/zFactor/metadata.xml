		Calculate the Compressibility Factor 'z' for Hydrocarbon Gases //
		Computational algorithms to solve equations and find the
		compressibility factor `z` of hydrocarbon gases. Correlations
		available: Hall-Yarborough, Dranchuk-AbuKassem, Dranchuk-
		Purvis-Robinson, Beggs-Brill, Papp, Shell and an Artificial
		Neural Network correlation (Ann10) by Kamyab et al. The package
		uses the original Standing-Katz chart for statistical
		comparison and plotting. Applicable to sweet hydrocarbon gases
		for now.
