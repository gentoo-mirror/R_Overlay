		Compositional Statistical Framework for RNA Fractionation
		Analysis // A compositional statistical framework for absolute
		proportion estimation between fractions in RNA sequencing data.
		'FracFixR' addresses the fundamental challenge in fractionated
		RNA-seq experiments where library preparation and sequencing
		depth obscure the original proportions of RNA fractions. It
		reconstructs original fraction proportions using non-negative
		linear regression, estimates the "lost" unrecoverable fraction,
		corrects individual transcript frequencies, and performs
		differential proportion testing between conditions. Supports
		any RNA fractionation protocol including polysome profiling,
		sub-cellular localization, and RNA-protein complex isolation.
