		Synthetic Microdata and Spatial MicroSimulation Modeling for ACS
		Data // Provides access to curated American Community Survey
		(ACS) base tables via a wrapper to library(acs). Builds
		synthetic micro-datasets at any user-specified geographic level
		with ten default attributes; and, conducts spatial
		microsimulation modeling (SMSM) via simulated annealing.  SMSM
		is conducted in parallel by default. Lastly, we provide
		functionality for data-extensibility of micro-datasets.
