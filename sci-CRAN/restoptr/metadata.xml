		Ecological Restoration Planning // Flexible framework for
		ecological restoration planning. It aims to identify priority
		areas for restoration efforts using optimization algorithms
		(based on Justeau-Allaire et al. 2021
		doi:10.1111/1365-2664.13803). Priority areas can be identified
		by maximizing landscape indices, such as the effective mesh
		size (Jaeger 2000 doi:10.1023/A:1008129329289), or the integral
		index of connectivity (Pascual-Hortal  Saura 2006
		doi:10.1007/s10980-006-0013-z). Additionally, constraints can
		be used to ensure that priority areas exhibit particular
		characteristics (e.g., ensure that particular places are not
		selected for restoration, ensure that priority areas form a
		single contiguous network). Furthermore, multiple near-optimal
		solutions can be generated to explore multiple options in
		restoration planning. The package leverages the 'Choco-solver'
		software to perform optimization using constraint programming
		(CP) techniques (https://choco-solver.org/).
