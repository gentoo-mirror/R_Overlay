		Generates Raven-Like Matrices According to Rules // Generates
		Raven like matrices according to different rules and the
		response list associated to the matrix. The package can
		generate matrices composed of 4 or 9 cells, along with a
		response list of 11 elements (the correct response + 10
		incorrect responses). The matrices can be generated according
		to both logical rules (i.e., the relationships between the
		elements in the matrix are manipulated to create the matrix)
		and visual-spatial rules (i.e., the visual or spatial
		characteristics of the elements are manipulated to generate the
		matrix). The graphical elements of this package are based on
		the 'DescTools' package. This package has been developed within
		the PRIN2020 Project (Prot. 20209WKCLL) titled "Computerized,
		Adaptive and Personalized Assessment of Executive Functions and
		Fluid Intelligence" and founded by the Italian Ministry of
		Education and Research.
