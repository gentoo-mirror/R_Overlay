		Optimized Rendering of Fold Changes and Confidence Values //
		Shows color patches for encoding fold changes (e.g. log ratios)
		together with confidence values within a single diagram. This
		is especially useful for rendering gene expression data as well
		as other types of differential experiments. In addition to
		different rendering methods (ggplot extensions) functionality
		for perceptually optimizing color palettes are provided.
		Furthermore the package provides extension methods of the
		colorspace color-class in order to simplify the work with
		palettes (a.o. length, as.list, and append are supported).
