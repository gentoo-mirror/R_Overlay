		Dynamic Relational Event Analysis and Modeling // A set of tools
		for relational and event analysis, including two- and one-mode
		network brokerage and structural measures, and helper functions
		optimized for relational event analysis with large datasets,
		including creating relational risk sets, computing network
		statistics, estimating relational event models, and simulating
		relational event sequences. For more information on relational
		event models, see Butts (2008)
