		Case Classification and Selection Based on Regression Results //
		Researchers doing a mixed-methods analysis (nested analysis as
		developed by Lieberman (2005) doi:10.1017/S0003055405051762)
		can use the package for the classification of cases and case
		selection using results of a linear regression. One can
		designate cases as typical, deviant, extreme and pathway case
		and use different case selection strategies for the choice of a
		case belonging to one of these types.
