		Design and Analysis of Disease Surveillance Activities // A range
		of functions for the design and analysis of disease
		surveillance activities. These functions were originally
		developed for animal health surveillance activities but can be
		equally applied to aquatic animal, wildlife, plant and human
		health surveillance activities. Utilities are included for
		sample size calculation and analysis of representative surveys
		for disease freedom, risk-based studies for disease freedom and
		for prevalence estimation. This package is based on Cameron A.,
