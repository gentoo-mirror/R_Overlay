		Information Decomposition of Two-Phase Experiments // The main
		purpose of this package is to generate the structure of the
		analysis of variance (ANOVA) table of the two-phase
		experiments. The user only need to input the design and the
		relationships of the random and fixed factors using the
		Wilkinson-Rogers' syntax, this package can then quickly
		generate the structure of the ANOVA table with the coefficients
		of the variance components for the expected mean squares. Thus,
		the balanced incomplete block design and provides the
		efficiency factors of the fixed effects can also be studied and
		compared much easily.
