		Descent-Based Calibrated Optimal Direct Estimation // Algorithms
		for solving a self-calibrated l1-regularized quadratic
		programming problem without parameter tuning. The algorithm,
		called DECODE, can handle high-dimensional data without cross-
		validation. It is found useful in high dimensional portfolio
		selection (see Pun (2018) https://ssrn.com/abstract=3179569)
		and large precision matrix estimation and sparse linear
		discriminant analysis (see Pun and Hadimaja (2019)
		https://ssrn.com/abstract=3422590).
