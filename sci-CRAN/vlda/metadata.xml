		Visualization of Multidimensional Longitudinal Data // Assists in
		producing a plot that more effectively expresses changes over
		time for two different types (long format and wide format)
		using a consistent calling scheme for longitudinal data. It
		provides the ability to projection supplementary information
		(supplementary objects and variables) that can often occur in
		longitudinal data to graphs, as well as provides a new
		interactive implementation to perform the additional
		interpretation, so it is also useful for longitudinal data
		visuals analysis (see http://lib.pusan.ac.kr/resource/e-article
		/?app=edsmod=detailrecord_id=edsker.000004649097db_id=edsker
		for more information).
