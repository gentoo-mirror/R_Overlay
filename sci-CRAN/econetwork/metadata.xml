		Analyzing Ecological Networks // A collection of advanced tools,
		methods and models specifically  designed  for  analyzing
		different  types  of  ecological  networks - especially
		antagonistic  (food  webs,  host-parasite),  mutualistic
		(plant-pollinator, plant-fungus, etc)  and competitive
		networks, as well as their variability in time and space.
		Statistical models are developed to describe and understand the
		mechanisms that determine species interactions, and to decipher
		the organization of these ecological networks (Ohlmann et al.
