		Filtering and Assessing the Sample Size of Tracking Data //
		Functions to filter GPS/Argos locations, as well as assessing
		the sample size for the analysis of animal distributions. The
		filters remove temporal and spatial duplicates, fixes located
		at a given height from estimated high tide line, and locations
		with high error as described in Shimada et al. (2012)
		doi:10.3354/meps09747 and Shimada et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s00227-015-2771-0. Sample size for the analysis of
		animal distributions can be assessed by the conventional area-
		based approach or the alternative probability-based approach as
		described in Shimada et al. (2021) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13506.
