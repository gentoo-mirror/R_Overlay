		Estimation of the Proportion of Treatment Effect Explained by
		Surrogate Outcome Information // Provides functions to estimate
		the proportion of treatment effect on a censored primary
		outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on a censored
		surrogate outcome/event. All methods are described in detail in
		Parast, Tian, Cai (2020) "Assessing the Value of a Censored
		Surrogate Outcome" doi:10.1007/s10985-019-09473-1. The main
		functions are (1) R.q.event() which calculates the proportion
		of the treatment effect (the difference in restricted mean
		survival time at time t) explained by surrogate outcome
		information observed up to a selected landmark time, (2)
		R.t.estimate() which calculates the proportion of the treatment
		effect explained by primary outcome information only observed
		up to a selected landmark time, and (3) IV.event() which
		calculates the incremental value of the surrogate outcome
		information.
