		Phenotypic Integration Index // Provides functions to estimate
		the size-controlled phenotypic integration index, a novel
		method by Torices  Mndez (2014) doi:10.1086/676622 to solve
		problems due to individual size when estimating integration
		(namely, larger individuals have larger components, which will
		drive a correlation between components only due to resource
		availability that might obscure the observed measures of
		integration). In addition, the package also provides the
		classical estimation by Wagner (1984) doi:10.1007/BF00275224,
		bootstrapping and jackknife methods to calculate confidence
		intervals and a significance test for both integration indices.
		Further details can be found in Torices  Muoz-Pajares
