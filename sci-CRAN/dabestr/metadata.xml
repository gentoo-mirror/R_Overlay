		Data Analysis using Bootstrap-Coupled Estimation // Data Analysis
		using Bootstrap-Coupled ESTimation. Estimation statistics is a
		simple framework that avoids the pitfalls of significance
		testing. It uses familiar statistical concepts: means, mean
		differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on
		the effect size of one's experiment/intervention, as opposed to
		a false dichotomy engendered by P values. An estimation plot
		has two key features: 1. It presents all datapoints as a
		swarmplot, which orders each point to display the underlying
		distribution. 2. It presents the effect size as a bootstrap 95%
		confidence interval on a separate but aligned axes. Estimation
		plots are introduced in Ho et al (2018) doi:10.1101/377978.
