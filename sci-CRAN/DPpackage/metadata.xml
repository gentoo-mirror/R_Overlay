		Bayesian Nonparametric Modeling in R // Functions to perform
		inference via simulation from the posterior distributions for
		Bayesian nonparametric and semiparametric models. Although the
		name of the package was motivated by the Dirichlet Process
		prior, the package considers and will consider other priors on
		functional spaces. So far, DPpackage includes models
		considering Dirichlet Processes, Dependent Dirichlet Processes,
		Dependent Poisson- Dirichlet Processes, Hierarchical Dirichlet
		Processes, Polya Trees, Linear Dependent Tailfree Processes,
		Mixtures of Triangular distributions, Random Bernstein
		polynomials priors and Dependent Bernstein Polynomials.  The
		package also includes models considering Penalized B-Splines.
		Includes semiparametric models for marginal and conditional
		density estimation, ROC curve analysis, interval censored data,
		binary regression models, generalized linear mixed models, IRT
		type models, and generalized additive models. Also contains
		functions to compute Pseudo-Bayes factors for model comparison,
		and to elicitate the precision parameter of the Dirichlet
		Process. To maximize computational efficiency, the actual
		sampling for each model is done in compiled FORTRAN. The
		functions return objects which can be subsequently analyzed
		with functions provided in the 'coda' package.
