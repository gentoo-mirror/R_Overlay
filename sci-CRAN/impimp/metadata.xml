		Imprecise Imputation for Statistical Matching // Imputing
		blockwise missing data by imprecise imputation, featuring a
		domain-based, variable-wise, and case-wise strategy.
		Furthermore, the estimation of lower and upper bounds for
		unconditional and conditional probabilities based on the
		obtained imprecise data is implemented. Additionally, two
		utility functions are supplied: one to check whether variables
		in a data set contain set-valued observations; and another to
		merge two already imprecisely imputed data. The method is
		described in a technical report by Endres, Fink and Augustin
		(2018, doi:10.5282/ubm/epub.42423).
