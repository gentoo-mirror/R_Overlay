		Additional Operators to Help you Write Cleaner R Code // Provides
		string arithmetic, reassignment operators, logical operators
		that handle missing values, and extra logical operators such as
		floating point equality and all or nothing. The intent is to
		allow R users to write code that is easier to read, write, and
		maintain while providing a friendlier experience to new R users
		from other language backgrounds (such as 'Python') who are used
		to concepts such as x += 1 and 'foo' + 'bar'. Includes
		operators for not in, easy floating point comparisons, ===
		equivalent, and SQL-like like operations (), etc. We also added
		in some extra helper functions, such as OS checks, pasting in
		Oxford comma format, and functions to get the first, last, nth,
		or most common element of a vector or word in a string.
