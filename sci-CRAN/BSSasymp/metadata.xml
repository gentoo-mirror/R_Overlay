		Asymptotic Covariance Matrices of Some BSS Mixing and Unmixing
		Matrix Estimates. // Functions to compute the asymptotic
		covariance matrices of mixing and unmixing matrix estimates of
		the following blind source separation (BSS) methods: symmetric
		FastICA, regular and adaptive deflation-based FastICA, FOBI,
		JADE, AMUSE and deflation-based and symmetric SOBI. Also
		functions to estimate these covariances based on data are
		available.
