		Asymptotic Covariance Matrices of Some BSS Mixing and Unmixing
		Matrix Estimates // Functions to compute the asymptotic
		covariance matrices of mixing and unmixing matrix estimates of
		the following blind source separation (BSS) methods: symmetric
		and squared symmetric FastICA, regular and adaptive deflation-
		based FastICA, FOBI, JADE, AMUSE and deflation-based and
		symmetric SOBI. Also functions to estimate these covariances
		based on data are available.
