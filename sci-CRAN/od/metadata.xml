		Manipulate and Map Origin-Destination Data // The aim of 'od' is
		to provide tools and example datasets for working with origin-
		destination ('OD') datasets of the type used to describe
		aggregate urban mobility patterns (Carey et al. 1981)
		doi:10.1287/trsc.15.1.32. The package builds on functions for
		working with 'OD' data in the package 'stplanr', (Lovelace and
		Ellison 2018) doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053 with a focus on
		computational efficiency and support for  the 'sf' class system
		(Pebesma 2018) doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-009. With few dependencies
		and a simple class system based on data frames, the package is
		intended to facilitate efficient analysis of 'OD' datasets and
		to provide a place for developing new functions. The package
		enables the creation and analysis of geographic entities
		representing large scale mobility patterns, from daily travel
		between zones in cities to migration between countries.
