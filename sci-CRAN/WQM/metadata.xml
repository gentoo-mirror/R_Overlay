		Wavelet-Based Quantile Mapping for Postprocessing Numerical
		Weather Predictions // The wavelet-based quantile mapping (WQM)
		technique is designed to correct biases in spatio-temporal
		precipitation forecasts across multiple time scales. The WQM
		method effectively enhances forecast accuracy by generating an
		ensemble of precipitation forecasts that account for
		uncertainties in the prediction process. For a comprehensive
		overview of the methodologies employed in this package, please
		refer to Jiang, Z., and Johnson, F. (2023)
		doi:10.1029/2022EF003350. The package relies on two packages
		for continuous wavelet transforms: 'WaveletComp', which can be
		installed automatically, and 'wmtsa', which is optional and
		available from the CRAN archive
		https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/wmtsa/. Users
		need to manually install 'wmtsa' from this archive if they
		prefer to use 'wmtsa' based decomposition.
