		Gaussian Process Fitting // Fits a Gaussian process model to
		data. Gaussian processes are commonly used in computer
		experiments to fit an interpolating model. The model is stored
		as an 'R6' object and can be easily updated with new data.
		There are options to run in parallel, and 'Rcpp' has been used
		to speed up calculations. For more info about Gaussian process
		software, see Erickson et al. (2018)
