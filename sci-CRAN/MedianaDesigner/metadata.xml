		Power and Sample Size Calculations for Clinical Trials //
		Efficient simulation-based power and sample size calculations
		are supported for a broad class of late-stage clinical trials.
		The following modules are included in the package: Adaptive
		designs with data-driven sample size or event count re-
		estimation, Adaptive designs with data-driven treatment
		selection, Adaptive designs with data-driven population
		selection, Optimal selection of a futility stopping rule, Event
		prediction in event-driven trials, Adaptive trials with
		response-adaptive randomization (experimental module),
		Traditional trials with multiple objectives (experimental
		module). Traditional trials with cluster-randomized designs
		(experimental module).
