		Joint Segmentation of Multivariate (Copy Number) Signals //
		Methods for fast segmentation of multivariate signals into
		piecewise constant profiles and for generating realistic copy-
		number profiles. A typical application is the joint
		segmentation of total DNA copy numbers and allelic ratios
		obtained from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) microarrays
		in cancer studies. The methods are described in Pierre-Jean,
		Rigaill and Neuvial (2015) doi:10.1093/bib/bbu026.
