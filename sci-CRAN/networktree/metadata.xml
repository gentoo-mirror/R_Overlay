		Recursive Partitioning of Network Models // Network trees
		recursively partition the data with respect to covariates. Two
		network tree algorithms are available: model-based trees based
		on a multivariate normal model and nonparametric trees based on
		covariance structures. After partitioning, correlation-based
		networks (psychometric networks) can be fit on the partitioned
		data.
