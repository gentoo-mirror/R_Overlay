		Variable Importance Plots // A general framework for constructing
		variable importance plots from various types of machine
		learning models in R. Aside from some standard model- specific
		variable importance measures, this package also provides model-
		agnostic approaches that can be applied to any supervised
		learning algorithm. These include 1) an efficient permutation-
		based variable importance measure, 2) variable importance based
		on Shapley values (Strumbelj and Kononenko, 2014)
		doi:10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x, and 3) the variance-based
		approach described in Greenwell et al. (2018) arXiv:1805.04755.
		A variance-based method for quantifying the relative strength
		of interaction effects is also included (see the previous
		reference for details).
