		Learn Clustering Techniques Through Examples and Code // A
		comprehensive educational package combining clustering
		algorithms with detailed step-by-step explanations. Provides
		implementations of both traditional (hierarchical, k-means) and
		modern (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with
		Noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), genetic k-means)
		clustering methods as described in Ezugwu et. al., (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.engappai.2022.104743. Includes educational
		datasets highlighting different clustering challenges, based on
		'scikit-learn' examples (Pedregosa et al., 2011)
		https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v12/pedregosa11a.html.
		Features detailed algorithm explanations, visualizations, and
		weighted distance calculations for enhanced learning.
