		Functions for Computing Wavelet Filters, Wavelet Transforms and
		Multiresolution Analyses // Contains functions for computing
		and plotting discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and maximal
		overlap discrete wavelet transforms (MODWT), as well as their
		inverses. Additionally, it contains functionality for computing
		and plotting wavelet transform filters that are used in the
		above decompositions as well as multiresolution analyses.
