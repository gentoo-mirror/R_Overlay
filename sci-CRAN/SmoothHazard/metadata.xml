		Estimation of Smooth Hazard Models for Interval-Censored Data //
		Estimation of two-state (survival) models and irreversible
		illness- death models with possibly interval-censored, left-
		truncated and right-censored data. Proportional intensities
		regression models can be specified to allow for covariates
		effects separately for each transition. We use either a
		parametric approach with Weibull baseline intensities or a
		semi-parametric approach with M-splines approximation of
		baseline intensities in order to obtain smooth estimates of the
		hazard functions. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum
		likelihood in the parametric approach and by penalized maximum
		likelihood in the semi-parametric approach.
