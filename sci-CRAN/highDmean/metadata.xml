		Testing Two-Sample Mean in High Dimension // Implements the high-
		dimensional two-sample test proposed by Zhang (2019)
		http://hdl.handle.net/2097/40235. It also implements the test
		proposed by Srivastava, Katayama, and Kano (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2012.08.014. These tests are particularly
		suitable to high dimensional data from two populations for
		which the classical multivariate Hotelling's T-square test
		fails due to sample sizes smaller than dimensionality. In this
		case, the ZWL and ZWLm tests proposed by Zhang (2019)
		http://hdl.handle.net/2097/40235, referred to as zwl_test() in
		this package, provide a reliable and powerful test.
