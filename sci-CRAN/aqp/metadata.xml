		Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology // The Algorithms for
		Quantitative Pedology (AQP) project was started in 2009 to
		organize a loosely-related set of concepts and source code on
		the topic of soil profile visualization, aggregation, and
		classification into this package (aqp). Over the past 8 years,
		the project has grown into a suite of related R packages that
		enhance and simplify the quantitative analysis of soil profile
		data. Central to the AQP project is a new vocabulary of
		specialized functions and data structures that can accommodate
		the inherent complexity of soil profile information; freeing
		the scientist to focus on ideas rather than boilerplate data
		processing tasks doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2012.10.020. These
		functions and data structures have been extensively tested and
		documented, applied to projects involving hundreds of thousands
		of soil profiles, and deeply integrated into widely used tools
		such as SoilWeb
		https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/soilweb-apps/.
		Components of the AQP project (aqp, soilDB, sharpshootR,
		soilReports packages) serve an important role in routine data
		analysis within the USDA-NRCS Soil Science Division. The AQP
		suite of R packages offer a convenient platform for bridging
		the gap between pedometric theory and practice.
