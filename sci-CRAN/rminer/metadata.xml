		Data Mining Classification and Regression Methods // Facilitates
		the use of data mining algorithms in classification and
		regression (including time series forecasting) tasks by
		presenting a short and coherent set of functions. Versions:
		1.4.8 improved help, several warning and error code fixes (more
		stable version, all examples run correctly); 1.4.7 improved
		Importance function and examples, minor error fixes; 1.4.6 /
		1.4.5 / 1.4.4 new automated machine learning (AutoML) and
		ensembles, via improved fit(), mining() and mparheuristic()
		functions, and new categorical preprocessing, via improved
		delevels() function; 1.4.3 new metrics (e.g., macro precision,
		explained variance), new "lssvm" model and improved
		mparheuristic() function; 1.4.2 new "NMAE" metric, "xgboost"
		and "cv.glmnet" models (16 classification and 18 regression
		models); 1.4.1 new tutorial and more robust version; 1.4 - new
		classification and regression models, with a total of 14
		classification and 15 regression methods, including: Decision
		Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random
		Forests, Bagging and Boosting; 1.3 and 1.3.1 - new
		classification and regression metrics; 1.2 - new input
		importance methods via improved Importance() function; 1.0 -
		first version.
