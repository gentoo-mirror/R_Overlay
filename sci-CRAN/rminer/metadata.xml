		Data Mining Classification and Regression Methods // Facilitates
		the use of data mining algorithms in classification and
		regression (including time series forecasting) tasks by
		presenting a short and coherent set of functions. Versions:
		1.4.3 new metrics (e.g., macro precision, explained variance),
		new least squares support vector machine model and improved
		mparheuristic function; 1.4.2 new NMAE metric, "xgboost" and
		"cv.glmnet" models (16 classification and 18 regression
		models); 1.4.1 new tutorial and more robust version; 1.4 - new
		classification and regression models/algorithms, with a total
		of 14 classification and 15 regression methods, including:
		Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
		Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting; 1.3 and 1.3.1 - new
		classification and regression metrics (improved mmetric
		function); 1.2 - new input importance methods (improved
		Importance function); 1.0 - first version.
