		Transformations for Unit-Level Small Area Models // The aim of
		this package is to offer new methodology for unit-level small
		area models under transformations and limited population
		auxiliary information. In addition to this new methodology, the
		widely used nested error regression model without
		transformations (see "An Error-Components Model for Prediction
		of County Crop Areas Using Survey and Satellite Data" by
		Battese, Harter and Fuller (1988)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478561) and its well-known
		uncertainty estimate (see "The estimation of the mean squared
		error of small-area estimators" by Prasad and Rao (1990)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.1995.10476570) are provided. In this
		package, the log transformation and the data-driven log-shift
		transformation are provided. If a transformation is selected,
		an appropriate method is chosen depending on the respective
		input of the population data: Individual population data (see
		"Empirical best prediction under a nested error model with log
		transformation" by Molina and Martn (2018)
		doi:10.1214/17-aos1608) but also aggregated population data
		(see "Estimating regional income indicators under
		transformations and access to limited population auxiliary
		information" by Wrz, Schmid and Tzavidis unpublished) can be
		entered. Especially under limited data access, new
		methodologies are provided in 'saeTrafo'. Several options are
		available to assess the used model and to judge, present and
		export its results. For a detailed description of the package
		and the methods used see the corresponding vignette.
