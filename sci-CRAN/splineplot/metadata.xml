		Visualization of Spline Effects in GAM and GLM Models // Creates
		'ggplot2'-based visualizations of smooth effects from GAM
		(Generalized Additive Models) fitted with 'mgcv' and spline
		effects from GLM (Generalized Linear Models). Supports
		interaction terms and provides hazard ratio plots with
		histograms for survival analysis. Wood (2017,
		ISBN:9781498728331) provides comprehensive methodology for
		generalized additive models.
