		Automatic Detection of Experimental Unit in Precision Agriculture
		// A part of precision agriculture is linked to the spectral
		image obtained from the cameras. With the image information of
		the agricultural experiment, the included functions facilitate
		the collection of spectral data associated with the
		experimental units. Some designs generated in R are linked to
		the images, which allows the use of the information of each
		pixel of the image in the experimental unit and the treatment.
		Tables and images are generated for the analysis of the
		precision agriculture experiment during the entire vegetative
		period of the crop.
