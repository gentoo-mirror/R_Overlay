		Bayesian Mortality Modelling with 'Stan' // Implementation of
		popular mortality models using the 'rstan' package, which
		provides the R interface to the 'Stan' C++ library for Bayesian
		estimation. The package supports well-known models proposed in
		the actuarial and demographic literature including the Lee-
		Carter (1992) doi:10.1080/01621459.1992.10475265 and the
		Cairns-Blake-Dowd (2006) doi:10.1111/j.1539-6975.2006.00195.x
		models. By a simple call, the user inputs deaths and exposures
		and the package outputs the MCMC simulations for each
		parameter, the log likelihoods and predictions. Moreover, the
		package includes tools for model selection and Bayesian model
		averaging by leave future-out validation.
