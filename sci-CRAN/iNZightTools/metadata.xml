		Tools for 'iNZight' // Provides a collection of wrapper functions
		for common variable and dataset manipulation workflows
		primarily used by 'iNZight', a graphical user interface
		providing easy exploration and visualisation of data for
		students of statistics, available in both desktop and online
		versions. Additionally, many of the functions return the
		'tidyverse' code used to obtain the result in an effort to
		bridge the gap between GUI and coding.
