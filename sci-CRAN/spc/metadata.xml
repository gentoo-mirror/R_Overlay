		Statistical Process Control -- Calculation of ARL and Other
		Control Chart Performance Measures // Evaluation of control
		charts by means of the zero-state, steady-state ARL (Average
		Run Length) and RL quantiles. Setting up control charts for
		given in-control ARL. The control charts under consideration
		are one- and two-sided EWMA, CUSUM, and Shiryaev-Roberts
		schemes for monitoring the mean or variance of normally
		distributed independent data. ARL calculation of the same set
		of schemes under drift (in the mean) are added. Eventually, all
		ARL measures for the multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) are provided.
