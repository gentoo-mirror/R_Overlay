		Bayesian Generalized Linear Models with Time-Varying Coefficients
		// Efficient Bayesian generalized linear models with time-
		varying coefficients as in Helske (2022,
		doi:10.1016/j.softx.2022.101016). Gaussian, Poisson, and
		binomial observations are supported. The Markov chain Monte
		Carlo (MCMC) computations are done using Hamiltonian Monte
		Carlo provided by Stan, using a state space representation of
		the model in order to marginalise over the coefficients for
		efficient sampling. For non-Gaussian models, the package uses
		the importance sampling type estimators based on approximate
		marginal MCMC as in Vihola, Helske, Franks (2020,
		doi:10.1111/sjos.12492).
