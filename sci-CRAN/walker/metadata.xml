		Efficient Bayesian Linear Regression with Time-Varying
		Coefficients // Fully Bayesian linear regression where the
		regression coefficients are allowed to vary over "time", either
		as independent random walks. All computations are done using
		Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provided by Stan, using a state space
		representation of the model in order to marginalise over the
		coefficients for efficient sampling.
