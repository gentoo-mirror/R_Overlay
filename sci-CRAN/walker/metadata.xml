		Bayesian Regression with Time-Varying Coefficients // Bayesian
		dynamic regression models where the regression coefficients can
		vary over time as random walks. Gaussian, Poisson, and binomial
		observations are supported. The Markov chain Monte Carlo
		computations are done using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provided by
		Stan, using a state space representation of the model in order
		to marginalise over the coefficients for efficient sampling.
		For non-Gaussian models, walker uses the importance sampling
		type estimators based on approximate marginal MCMC as in
		Vihola, Helske, Franks (2017, arXiv:1609.02541).
