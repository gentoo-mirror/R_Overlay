		Meta-Analysis of Phase I Dose-Finding Early Clinical Trials //
		Meta-analysis approaches for Phase I dose finding early phases
		clinical trials in order to better suit requirements in terms
		of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and maximal dose regimen (MDR).
		This package has currently three different approaches: (a) an
		approach proposed by Zohar et al, 2011, doi:10.1002/sim.4121
		(denoted as ZKO), (b) the Variance Weighted pooling analysis
		(called VarWT) and (c) the Random Effects Model Based (REMB)
		algorithm, where user can input his/her own model based
		approach or use the existing random effect logistic regression
		model (named as glimem) through the 'dfmeta' package.
