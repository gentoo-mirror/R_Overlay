		Get and Modify 'oTree' Data // Efficiently manage and process
		data from 'oTree' experiments. Import 'oTree' data and clean
		them by using functions that handle messy data, dropouts, and
		other problematic cases.  Create IDs, calculate the time,
		transfer variables between app data frames, and delete
		sensitive information.  Review your experimental data prior to
		running the experiment and automatically generate a detailed
		summary of the variables used in your 'oTree' code.
		Information on 'oTree' is found in Chen, D. L., Schonger, M.,
		Wickens, C. (2016) doi:10.1016/j.jbef.2015.12.001.
