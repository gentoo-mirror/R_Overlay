		Combine and Export Data Frames // Functions to combine
		data.frames in ways that require additional effort in base R,
		and to add metadata (id, title, ...) that can be used for
		printing and xlsx export. The 'Tatoo_report' class is provided
		as a convenient helper to write several such tables to a
		workbook, one table per worksheet.
