		Adoption Probability, Triers and Users Rate of a New Product //
		Calculate users prevalence of a product based on the prevalence
		of triers in the population. The measurement of triers is
		relatively easy. It is just a question of whether a person
		tried a product even once in his life or not. On the other
		hand, The measurement of people who also adopt it as part of
		their life is more complicated since adopting an innovative
		product is a subjective view of the individual. Mickey Kislev
		and Shira Kislev developed a formula to calculate the
		prevalence of a product's users to overcome this difficulty.
		The current package assists in calculating the users prevalence
		of a product based on the prevalence of triers in the
		population. See for: Kislev, M. M., and S. Kislev (2020)
