		Adoption Probability, Triers and Users Rate of a New Product //
		Calculating users of a product based on the prevalence of
		triers in the population. The measuring of triers is relatively
		easy. It is just a question of whether a person tried a product
		even once in his life or not. While measuring the rate of
		people who also adopt it as part of their life is more
		complicated since the adoption of an innovative product is a
		subjective view of the individual. Mickey Kislev and Shira
		Kislev developed a formula to calculates the prevalence of
		users of a product to overcome this difficulty. The current
		calculator assists in calculating the users of a product based
		on the prevalence of triers in the population. See for: Kislev,
		M., and S. Kislev (2020) doi:10.5539/ijms.v12n4p63.
