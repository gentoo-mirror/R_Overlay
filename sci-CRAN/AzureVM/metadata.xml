		Virtual Machines in 'Azure' // Functionality for working with
		virtual machines (VMs) in Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud:
		https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/.
		Includes facilities to create, startup, shutdown, and cleanly
		delete VMs and VM clusters. With a running VM, execute scripts
		and install optional extensions. A selection of VM templates
		based on the 'Data Science Virtual Machine' (DSVM) is supplied;
		this allows fast and easy provisioning of a VM preinstalled
		with several software packages useful for data science.
		Alternatively, users can provide VM templates of their own.
