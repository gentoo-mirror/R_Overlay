		Time Series Clustering Along with Optimizations for the Dynamic
		Time Warping Distance // Time series clustering along with
		optimized techniques related to the Dynamic Time Warping
		distance and its corresponding lower bounds. Implementations of
		partitional, hierarchical, fuzzy, k-Shape and TADPole
		clustering are available. Functionality can be easily extended
		with custom distance measures and centroid definitions.
		Implementations of DTW barycenter averaging, a distance based
		on global alignment kernels, and the soft-DTW distance and
		centroid routines are also provided. All included distance
		functions have custom loops optimized for the calculation of
		cross-distance matrices, including parallelization support.
		Several cluster validity indices are included.
