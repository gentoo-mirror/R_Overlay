		Creation of Stratum Orthogonal Arrays // Creates stratum
		orthogonal arrays (also known as strong orthogonal arrays).
		These are arrays with more levels per column than the typical
		orthogonal array, and whose low order projections behave like
		orthogonal arrays, when collapsing levels to coarser strata.
		Details are described in Groemping (2021) "A unified
		implementation of stratum (aka strong) orthogonal arrays"
