		Testing, Monitoring, and Dating Structural Changes: C++ Version
		// A fast implementation with additional experimental features
		for testing, monitoring and dating structural changes in
		(linear) regression models. 'strucchangeRcpp' features
		tests/methods from the generalized fluctuation test framework
		as well as from the F test (Chow test) framework. This includes
		methods to fit, plot and test fluctuation processes (e.g.
		cumulative/moving sum, recursive/moving estimates) and F
		statistics, respectively. These methods are described in
		Zeileis et al. (2002) doi:10.18637/jss.v007.i02. Finally, the
		breakpoints in regression models with structural changes can be
		estimated together with confidence intervals, and their
		magnitude as well as the model fit can be evaluated using a
		variety of statistical measures.
