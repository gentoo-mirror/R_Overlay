		Build Panel Data Sets from PSID Raw Data // Makes it easy to
		build panel data in wide format from PSID delivered raw data.
		Deals with data downloaded and pre-processed by Stata or SAS,
		or can optionally download directly from the PSID server using
		the SAScii package. `psidR` takes care of merging data from
		each wave onto a cross-period index file, so that individuals
		can be followed over time. The user must specify which years
		they are interested in, and the PSID variable names (e.g.
		ER21003) for each year (they differ in each year). There are
		different panel data designs and sample subsetting criteria
		implemented ("SRC", "SEO", "immigrant" and "latino" samples).
