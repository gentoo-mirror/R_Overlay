		Build Panel Data Sets from PSID Raw Data // Makes it easy to
		build panel data in wide format from Panel Survey of Income
		Dynamics ('PSID') delivered raw data. Deals with data
		downloaded and pre-processed by 'Stata' or 'SAS', or can
		optionally download directly from the PSID server using the
		'SAScii' package. 'psidR' takes care of merging data from each
		wave onto a cross-period index file, so that individuals can be
		followed over time. The user must specify which years they are
		interested in, and the 'PSID' variable names (e.g. ER21003) for
		each year (they differ in each year). The package offers helper
		functions to retrieve variable names from different waves.
		There are different panel data designs and sample subsetting
		criteria implemented ("SRC", "SEO", "immigrant" and "latino"
		samples).
