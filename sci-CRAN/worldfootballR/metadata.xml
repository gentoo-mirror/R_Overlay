		Functions to Extract and Clean World Football (Soccer) Data // A
		set of functions to allow users to obtain clean and tidy
		football (soccer) game, team and player data. Data is collected
		from a number of popular sites, including
		'FBref'https://fbref.com/en/, transfer and valuations data from
		'Transfermarkt'https://www.transfermarkt.com/ and shooting
		location and other match stats data from
		'Understat'https://understat.com/ and
		'fotmob'https://www.fotmob.com/. It gives users the ability to
		access data more efficiently, rather than having to export data
		tables to files before being able to complete their analysis.
