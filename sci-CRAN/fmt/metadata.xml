		Variance Estimation of FMT Method (Fully Moderated T-Statistic)
		// The FMT method computes posterior residual variances to be
		used in the denominator of a moderated t-statistic from a
		linear model analysis of gene expression data. It is an
		extension of the moderated t-statistic originally proposed by
		Smyth (2004) doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1027. LOESS local regression
		and empirical Bayesian method are used to estimate gene
		specific prior degrees of freedom and prior variance based on
		average gene intensity levels. The posterior residual variance
		in the denominator is a weighted average of prior and residual
		variance and the weights are prior degrees of freedom and
		residual variance degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom of
		the moderated t-statistic is simply the sum of prior and
		residual variance degrees of freedom.
