		Periodogram Peaks in Correlated Time Series // Calculates the
		periodogram of a time series, maximum-likelihood fits an
		Ornstein-Uhlenbeck state space (OUSS) null model and evaluates
		the statistical significance of periodogram peaks against the
		OUSS null hypothesis. The OUSS is a parsimonious model for
		stochastically fluctuating variables with linear stabilizing
		forces, subject to uncorrelated measurement errors. Contrary to
		the classical white noise null model for detecting cyclicity,
		the OUSS model can account for temporal correlations typically
		occurring in ecological and geological time series. Citation:
