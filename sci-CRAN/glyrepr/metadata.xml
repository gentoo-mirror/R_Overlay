		Representation for Glycan Compositions and Structures //
		Computational representations of glycan compositions and
		structures, including details such as linkages, anomers, and
		substituents. Supports varying levels of monosaccharide
		specificity (e.g., "Hex" or "Gal") and ambiguous linkages.
		Provides robust parsing and generation of IUPAC-condensed
		structure strings. Optimized for vectorized operations on
		glycan structures, with efficient handling of duplications. As
		the cornerstone of the glycoverse ecosystem, this package
		delivers the foundational data structures that power glycomics
		and glycoproteomics analysis workflows.
