		Data Splitting Algorithms for Model Developments // Providing six
		different algorithms that can be used to split the available
		data into training, test and validation subsets with similar
		distribution for hydrological model developments. The
		dataSplit() function will help you divide the data according to
		specific requirements, and you can refer to the par.default()
		function to set the parameters for data splitting. The getAUC()
		function will help you measure the similarity of distribution
		features between the data subsets. For more information about
		the data splitting algorithms, please refer to: Chen et al.
