		Tropical Cyclone (Hurricane, Typhoon) Spatial Hazard Modelling //
		Methods for generating modelled parametric Tropical Cyclone
		(TC) spatial hazard fields and time series output at point
		locations from TC tracks.  R's compatibility to simply use fast
		'cpp' code via the 'Rcpp' package and the wide range spatial
		analysis tools via the 'terra' package makes it an attractive
		open source environment to study 'TCs'.  This package estimates
		TC vortex wind and pressure fields using parametric equations
		originally coded up in 'python' by 'TCRM'
		https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/tcrm and then coded up
		in 'Cuda' 'cpp' by 'TCwindgen'
		https://github.com/CyprienBosserelle/TCwindgen.
