		Bayesian Analysis of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect // It is
		vital to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE)
		when making health care decisions for an individual patient or
		a group of patients. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to
		evaluate HTE based on information collected from clinical
		studies that are often designed and conducted to evaluate the
		efficacy of a treatment for the overall population. The
		Bayesian framework offers a principled and flexible approach to
		estimate and compare treatment effects across subgroups of
		patients defined by their characteristics. This package allows
		users to explore a wide range of Bayesian HTE analysis models,
		and produce posterior inferences about HTE. See Wang et al.
		(2018) 10.18637/jss.v085.i07 for further details.
