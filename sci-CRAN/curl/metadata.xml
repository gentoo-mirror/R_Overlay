		A Modern and Flexible Web Client for R // Bindings to 'libcurl'
		https://curl.se/libcurl/ for performing fully configurable
		HTTP/FTP requests where responses can be processed in memory,
		on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection
		interfaces. Some knowledge of 'libcurl' is recommended; for a
		more-user-friendly web client see the 'httr2' package which
		builds on this package with http specific tools and logic.
