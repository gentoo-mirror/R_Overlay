		Regression Model Diagnostics for Survey Data // Diagnostics for
		fixed effects linear regression models fitted with survey data.
		Extensions of standard diagnostics to complex survey data are
		included: standardized residuals, leverages, Cook's D, dfbetas,
		dffits, condition indexes, and variance inflation factors as
		found in Li and Valliant (Surv. Meth., 2009, 35(1), pp. 15-24;
		Jnl. of Off. Stat., 2011, 27(1), pp. 99-119; Jnl. of Off.
		Stat., 2015, 31(1), pp. 61-75); Liao and Valliant (Surv. Meth.,
		2012, 38(1), pp. 53-62; Surv. Meth., 2012, 38(2), pp. 189-202).
		Variance inflation factors are also computed for some general
		linear models (binomial, gaussian, poisson, quasibinomial, and
		quasipoisson) as described in Liao (U. Maryland thesis, 2010).
