		Implementation of the Everglades Phosphorus Gradient Model //
		Everglades Phosphorus Gradient Model predicts variations in
		water-column P concentration, peat accretion rate, and soil P
		concentration along a horizontal gradient imposed by an
		external phosphorus load and sheet-flow conditions. Potential
		biological responses are expressed in terms of marsh surface
		area exceeding threshold criteria for water-column and soil
		phosphorus concentrations. More information of the model can be
		found at http://www.wwwalker.net/epgm/.
