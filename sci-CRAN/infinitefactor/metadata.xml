		Bayesian Infinite Factor Models // Sampler and post-processing
		functions for semi-parametric Bayesian infinite factor models,
		motivated by the Multiplicative Gamma Shrinkage Prior of
		Bhattacharya and Dunson (2011)
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3419391/. Contains
		component C++ functions for building samplers for linear and
		2-way interaction factor models using the multiplicative gamma
		and Dirichlet-Laplace shrinkage priors. The package also
		contains post processing functions to return matrices that
		display rotational ambiguity to identifiability through
		successive application of orthogonalization procedures and
		resolution of column label and sign switching. This package was
		developed with the support of the National Institute of
		Environmental Health Sciences grant 1R01ES028804-01.
