		Cursor and Terminal Manipulation // A toolbox for developing
		applications, games, simulations, or agent-based models in the
		R terminal. Included functions allow users to move the cursor
		around the terminal screen, change text colors and attributes,
		clear the screen, hide and show the cursor, map key presses to
		functions, draw shapes and curves, among others. Most
		functionalities require users to be in a terminal (not the R
		GUI).
