		Weighting and Weighted Statistics // Provides a variety of
		functions for producing simple weighted statistics, such as
		weighted Pearson's correlations, partial correlations, Chi-
		Squared statistics, histograms, and t-tests.  Also now includes
		some software for quickly recoding survey data and plotting
		point estimates from interaction terms in regressions (and
		multiply imputed regressions).  Future versions of the package
		will be more closely integrated with 'anesrake' and additional
		weighting tools and will provide the option to find weighting
		benchmarks and weight data using a variety of methodologies.
		NOTE: Weighted partial correlation calculations temporarily
		pulled to address a bug.
