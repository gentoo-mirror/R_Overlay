		Weighting and Weighted Statistics // Provides a variety of
		functions for producing simple weighted statistics, such as
		weighted Pearson's correlations, partial correlations, Chi-
		Squared statistics, histograms, and t-tests as well as simple
		weighting graphics including weighted histograms, box plots,
		bar plots, and violin plots.  Also includes software for
		quickly recoding survey data and plotting estimates from
		interaction terms in regressions (and multiply imputed
		regressions) both with and without weights and summarizing
		various types of regressions. Some portions of this package
		were assisted by AI-generated suggestions using OpenAI's GPT
		model, with human review and integration.
