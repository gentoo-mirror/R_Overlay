		Post-Linkage Data Analysis Based on Mixture Modelling // Perform
		inference in the secondary analysis setting with linked data
		potentially containing mismatch errors. Only the linked data
		file may be accessible and information about the record linkage
		process may be limited or unavailable. Implements the 'General
		Framework for Regression with Mismatched Data' developed by
		Slawski et al. (2023) arXiv:2306.00909. The framework uses a
		mixture model for pairs of linked records whose two components
		reflect distributions conditional on match status, i.e.,
		correct match or mismatch. Inference is based on composite
		likelihood and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The
		package currently supports Cox Proportional Hazards Regression
		(right-censored data only) and Generalized Linear Regression
		Models (Gaussian, Gamma, Poisson, and Logistic (binary models
		only)). Information about the underlying record linkage process
		can be incorporated into the method if available (e.g., assumed
		overall mismatch rate, safe matches, predictors of match
		status, or predicted probabilities of correct matches).
