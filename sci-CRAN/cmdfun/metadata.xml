		Framework for Building Interfaces to Shell Commands // Writing
		interfaces to command line software is cumbersome. 'cmdfun'
		provides a framework for building function calls to seamlessly
		interface with shell commands by allowing lazy evaluation of
		command line arguments. 'cmdfun' also provides methods for
		handling user-specific paths to tool installs or secrets like
		API keys. Its focus is to equally serve package builders who
		wish to wrap command line software, and to help analysts stay
		inside R when they might usually leave to execute non-R
		software.
