		3D Forest Simulation Visualization Tool // This is a
		visualization tool for vegetation structure/succession in space
		and/or time mainly for forest gap models. However, it could
		also be used to visualize observed forest stands. If used for
		models, they should contain either individual trees or cohorts
		(e.g. LPJ-GUESS by Smith et al. (2014)
		doi:10.5194/bg-11-2027-2014). For a list of required and
		additional data fields see the vignette.
