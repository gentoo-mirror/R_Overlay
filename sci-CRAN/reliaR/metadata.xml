		Comprehensive Tools for some Probability Distributions //
		Provides a comprehensive suite of utilities for univariate
		continuous probability distributions and reliability models.
		Includes functions to compute the probability density,
		cumulative distribution, quantile, reliability, and hazard
		functions, along with random variate generation. Also offers
		diagnostic and model assessment tools  such as Quantile-
		Quantile (Q-Q) and Probability-Probability (P-P) plots, the
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, and model selection
		criteria including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
		Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Currently implements the
		following distributions: Burr X, Chen, Exponential Extension,
		Exponentiated Logistic, Exponentiated Weibull, Exponential
		Power, Flexible Weibull, Generalized Exponential, Gompertz,
		Generalized Power Weibull, Gumbel, Inverse Generalized
		Exponential, Linear Failure Rate, Log-Gamma, Logistic-
		Exponential, Logistic-Rayleigh, Log-log, Marshall-Olkin
		Extended Exponential, Marshall-Olkin Extended Weibull, and
		Weibull Extension distributions. Serves as a valuable resource
		for teaching and research in probability theory, reliability
		analysis, and applied statistical modeling.
