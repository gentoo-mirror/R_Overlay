		AHP Hybrid Method // The AHP method (Analytic Hierarchy Process)
		is a multi-criteria decision-making method addressing choice
		and outranking problems. The method enables to perform the
		analysis of alternatives in each type of criterion and then
		provides a global performance of each alternative in the
		decision context. The main difference of this package is the
		possibility of evaluating the alternatives using quantitative
		data, by numerical representation, and qualitative data, using
		the Saaty scale, providing preference relation between
		variables by a pairwise evaluation.
