		A Bayesian Tool for Near Real-Time Estimation of the Reproduction
		Number // Estimation of the instantaneous reproduction number
		with Laplacian-P-splines following the methodology of Gressani
		et al.(2021) doi:10.1101/2021.12.02.21267189. The negative
		Binomial distribution is used to model the time series of case
		counts. Two methods are available for inference : (1) a
		sampling-free approach based on a maximum a posteriori
		calibration of the hyperparameter vector and (2) a fully
		stochastic approach with a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm
		and Langevin diffusions for efficient sampling of the posterior
		distribution.
