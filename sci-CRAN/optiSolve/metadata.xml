		Linear, Quadratic, and Rational Optimization // Solver for
		linear, quadratic, and rational programs with linear,
		quadratic, and rational constraints. A unified interface to
		different R packages is provided. Optimization problems are
		transformed into equivalent formulations and solved by the
		respective package. For example, quadratic programming problems
		with linear, quadratic and rational constraints can be solved
		by augmented Lagrangian minimization using package 'alabama',
		or by sequential quadratic programming using solver 'slsqp'.
		Alternatively, they can be reformulated as optimization
		problems with second order cone constraints and solved with
		package 'cccp', or transformed into semidefinite programming
		problems and solved using solver 'csdp'.
