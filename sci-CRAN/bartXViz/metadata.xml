		Visualization of BART and BARP using SHAP // Complex machine
		learning models are often difficult to interpret. Shapley
		values serve as a powerful tool to understand and explain why a
		model makes a particular prediction. This package computes
		variable contributions using permutation-based Shapley values
		for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and its extension
		with Post-Stratification (BARP). The permutation-based SHAP
		method proposed by Strumbel and Kononenko (2014)
		doi:10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x is grounded in data obtained via
		MCMC sampling. Similar to the BART model introduced by Chipman,
		George, and McCulloch (2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285, this
		package leverages Bayesian posterior samples generated during
		model estimation, allowing variable contributions to be
		computed without requiring additional sampling. The BART model
		is designed to work with the following R packages: 'BART'
		doi:10.18637/jss.v097.i01, 'bartMachine'
		doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i04, and 'dbarts'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dbarts. For XGBoost and
		baseline adjustments, the approach by Lundberg et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1038/s42256-019-0138-9 is also considered. The BARP
		model proposed by Bisbee (2019) doi:10.1017/S0003055419000480
		was implemented with reference to
		https://github.com/jbisbee1/BARP and is designed to work with
		modified functions based on that implementation. BARP extends
		post-stratification by computing variable contributions within
		each stratum defined by stratifying variables. The resulting
		Shapley values are visualized through both global and local
		explanation methods.
