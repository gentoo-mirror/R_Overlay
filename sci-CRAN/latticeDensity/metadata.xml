		Density Estimation and Nonparametric Regression on Irregular
		Regions // Functions that compute the lattice-based density
		estimator of Barry and McIntyre, which accounts for point
		processes in two-dimensional regions with irregular boundaries
		and holes.  The package also implements two-dimensional non-
		parametric regression for similar regions.
