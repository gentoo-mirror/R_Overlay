		Regression with Multiple Change Points // Flexible and informed
		regression with Multiple Change Points. 'mcp' can infer change
		points in means, variances, autocorrelation structure, and any
		combination of these, as well as the parameters of the segments
		in between. All parameters are estimated with uncertainty and
		prediction intervals are supported - also near the change
		points. 'mcp' supports hypothesis testing via Savage-Dickey
		density ratio, posterior contrasts, and cross-validation. 'mcp'
		is described in Lindelv (submitted) doi:10.31219/osf.io/fzqxv
		and generalizes the approach described in Carlin, Gelfand,
		Smith (1992) doi:10.2307/2347570 and Stephens (1994)
		doi:10.2307/2986119.
