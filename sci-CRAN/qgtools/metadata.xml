		Generalized Quantitative Genetics Data Analyses // Two linear
		mixed model approaches: REML(restricted maximum likelihood) and
		MINQUE (minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation) approaches
		and several resampling techniques are integrated for various
		quantitative genetics analyses. With these two types of
		approaches, various unbalanced data structures, missing data,
		and any irregular genetic  mating designs can be analyzed and
		statistically tested. This package also offers fast
		computations for many large data sets.
