		'GNU Unifont' Hex Fonts // Contains all the hex font files from
		the 'GNU Unifont Project' https://unifoundry.com/unifont/
		compressed by 'xz'.  'GNU Unifont' is a duospaced bitmap font
		that attempts to cover all the official Unicode glyphs plus
		several of the artificial scripts in the '(Under-)ConScript
		Unicode Registry' http://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/.  Provides
		a convenience function for loading in several of them at the
		same time as a 'bittermelon' bitmap font object for easy
		rendering of the glyphs in an 'R' terminal or graphics device.
