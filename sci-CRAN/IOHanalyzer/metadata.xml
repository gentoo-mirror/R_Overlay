		Data Analysis Part of 'IOHprofiler' // The data analysis module
		for the Iterative Optimization Heuristics Profiler
		('IOHprofiler'). This module provides statistical analysis
		methods for the benchmark data generated by optimization
		heuristics, which can be visualized through a web-based
		interface. The benchmark data is usually generated by the
		experimentation module, called 'IOHexperimenter'. 'IOHanalyzer'
		also supports the widely used 'COCO' (Comparing Continuous
		Optimisers) data format for benchmarking.
