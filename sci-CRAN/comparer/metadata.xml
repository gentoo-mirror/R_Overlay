		Compare Output and Run Time // Quickly run experiments to compare
		the run time and output of code blocks. The function mbc() can
		make fast comparisons of code, and will calculate statistics
		comparing the resulting outputs. It can be used to compare
		model fits to the same data or see which function runs faster.
		The R6 class ffexp$new() runs a function using all possible
		combinations of selected inputs. This is useful for comparing
		the effect of different parameter values. It can also run in
		parallel and automatically save intermediate results, which is
		very useful for long computations.
