		Constrained Regression Model for an Ordinal Response and Ordinal
		Predictors // Fits a constrained regression model for an
		ordinal response with ordinal predictors and possibly others,
		Espinosa and Hennig (2019) doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9842-2. The
		parameter estimates associated with an ordinal predictor are
		constrained to be monotonic. If a monotonicity direction
		(isotonic or antitonic) is not specified for an ordinal
		predictor by the user, then the monotonicity direction
		classification procedure establishes it. Two monotonicity tests
		are also available to test the null hypothesis of monotonicity
		over a set of parameters associated with an ordinal predictor.
