		Constrained Regression Model for an Ordinal Response and Ordinal
		Predictors // Fits a constrained regression model for an
		ordinal response with ordinal predictors and possibly others,
		Espinosa and Hennig (2018) arXiv:1804.08715. The parameter
		estimates associated with an ordinal predictor are constrained
		to be monotonic. If a monotonicity direction (isotonic or
		antitonic) is not specified for an ordinal predictor by the
		user, then the monotonicity direction classification procedure
		establishes it. A monotonicity test is also available to test
		the null hypothesis of monotonicity over a set of parameters
		associated with an ordinal predictor.
