		Wrangle, Analyze, and Visualize Animal Movement Data // Tools to
		import, clean, and visualize movement data, particularly from
		motion capture systems such as Optitrack's 'Motive', the Straw
		Lab's 'Flydra', or from other sources. We provide functions to
		remove artifacts, standardize tunnel position and tunnel axes,
		select a region of interest, isolate specific trajectories,
		fill gaps in trajectory data, and calculate 3D and per-axis
		velocity. For experiments of visual guidance, we also provide
		functions that use subject position to estimate perception of
		visual stimuli.
