		Compute Node Overlap and Segregation in Ecological Networks //
		Calculate NOS (node overlap and segregation) and the associated
		metrics described in Strona and Veech (2015)
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12395 and Strona et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1111/ecog.03447. The functions provided in the package
		enable assessment of structural patterns ranging from complete
		node segregation to perfect nestedness in a variety of network
		types. In addition, they provide a measure of network
		modularity.
