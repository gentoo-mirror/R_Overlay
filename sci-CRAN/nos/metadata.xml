		Compute Node Overlap and Segregation in Ecological Networks //
		Calculate NOS (node overlap and segregation) and the associated
		metrics described in Strona and Veech (2015)
		DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.12395 and Strona et al. (2017; In Press,
		DOI to be provided in subsequent package version). The
		functions provided in the package enable assessment of
		structural patterns ranging from complete node segregation to
		perfect nestedness in a variety of network types. In addition,
		they provide a measure of network modularity.
