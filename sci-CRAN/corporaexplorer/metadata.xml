		A 'Shiny' App for Exploration of Text Collections // Facilitates
		dynamic exploration of text collections through an intuitive
		graphical user interface. The package contains 1) a helper
		function to convert a data frame to a 'corporaexplorerobject',
		2) a 'Shiny' app for fast and flexible exploration of a
		'corporaexplorerobject', and 3) a 'Shiny' app for simple
		retrieval/extraction of documents from a
		'corporaexplorerobject' in a reading-friendly format. The
		intended primary audience is qualitatively oriented researchers
		who rely on close reading of textual documents as part of their
		academic activity. Auto-scrolling is enabled by the
		'jquery.scrollTo' plugin, see
		https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo. For 'shinytest' to
		work, 'PhantomJS' (http://phantomjs.org/) is required.
