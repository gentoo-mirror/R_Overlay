		Novice Model Variation ANOVA // Due to 'Rstudio's' status as open
		source software, we believe it will be utilized frequently for
		future data analysis by users whom lack formal training or
		experience with 'R'. The 'NMVANOVA' (Novice Model Variation
		ANOVA) a streamlined variation of experimental design functions
		that allows novice 'Rstudio' users to perform different model
		variations one-way analysis of variance without downloading
		multiple libraries or packages. Users can easily manipulate the
		data block, and needed inputs so that users only have to plugin
		the four designed variables/values.
