		Ussher Data Set Drawn from 1658 Chronology // The "ussher" data
		set is drawn from original chronological textual historic
		events. Commonly known as James Ussher's Annals of the World,
		the source text was originally written in Latin in 1650, and
		published in English translation in 1658.The data are
		classified by index, year, epoch (or one of the 7 ancient "Ages
		of the World"), Biblical source book if referenced (rarely), as
		well as alternate dating mechanisms, such as "Anno Mundi" (age
		of the world) or "Julian Period" (dates based upon the Julian
		calendar). Additional file "usshfull" includes variables that
		may be of further interest to historians, such as Southern
		Kingdom and Northern Kingdom discrepant dates, and the original
		amalgamated dating mechanic used by Ussher in the original
		text. The raw data can also be called using "usshraw", as
		described in: Ussher, J. (1658)
