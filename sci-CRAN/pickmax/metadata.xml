		Split and Coalesce Duplicated Records // Deduplicates datasets by
		retaining the most complete and informative records. Identifies
		duplicated entries based on a specified key column, calculates
		completeness scores for each row, and compares values within
		groups. When differences between duplicates exceed a user-
		defined threshold, records are split into unique IDs;
		otherwise, they are coalesced into a single, most complete
		entry. Returns a list containing the original duplicates, the
		split entries, and the final coalesced dataset. Useful for
		cleaning survey or administrative data where duplicated IDs may
		reflect minor data entry inconsistencies.
