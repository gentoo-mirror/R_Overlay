		Identify Metabolic Subpathways Mediated by MicroRNAs // Routines
		for identifying metabolic subpathways mediated by microRNAs
		(miRNAs) through topologically locating miRNAs and genes within
		reconstructed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
		metabolic pathway graphs embedded by miRNAs. (1) This package
		can obtain the reconstructed KEGG metabolic pathway graphs with
		genes and miRNAs as nodes, through converting KEGG metabolic
		pathways to graphs with genes as nodes and compounds as edges,
		and then integrating miRNA-target interactions verified by low-
		throughput experiments from four databases (TarBase, miRecords,
		mirTarBase and miR2Disease) into converted pathway graphs. (2)
		This package can locate metabolic subpathways mediated by
		miRNAs by topologically analyzing the "lenient distance" of
		miRNAs and genes within reconstructed KEGG metabolic pathway
		graphs.(3) This package can identify significantly enriched
		miRNA-mediated metabolic subpathways based on located
		subpathways by hypergenomic test. (4) This package can support
		six species for metabolic subpathway identification, such as
		caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, danio rerio,
		homo sapiens, mus musculus and rattus norvegicus, and user only
		need to update interested organism-specific environment
		variables.
