		Evaluation Metrics for Implicit-Feedback Recommender Systems //
		Calculates evaluation metrics for implicit-feedback recommender
		systems that are based on low-rank matrix factorization models,
		given the fitted model matrices and data, thus allowing to
		compare models from a variety of libraries. Metrics include P@K
		(precision-at-k, for top-K recommendations), R@K (recall at k),
		AP@K (average precision at k), NDCG@K (normalized discounted
		cumulative gain at k), Hit@K (from which the 'Hit Rate' is
		calculated), RR@K (reciprocal rank at k, from which the 'MRR'
		or 'mean reciprocal rank' is calculated), ROC-AUC (area under
		the receiver-operating characteristic curve), and PR-AUC (area
		under the precision-recall curve). These are calculated on a
		per-user basis according to the ranking of items induced by the
		model, using efficient multi-threaded routines. Also provides
		functions for creating train-test splits for model fitting and
		evaluation.
