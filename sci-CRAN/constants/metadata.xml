		Reference on Constants, Units and Uncertainty // CODATA
		internationally recommended values of the fundamental physical
		constants, provided as symbols for direct use within the R
		language. Optionally, the values with uncertainties and/or
		units are also provided if the 'errors', 'units' and/or
		'quantities' packages are installed. The Committee on Data for
		Science and Technology (CODATA) is an interdisciplinary
		committee of the International Council for Science which
		periodically provides the internationally accepted set of
		values of the fundamental physical constants. This package
		contains the "2018 CODATA" version, published on May 2019: Eite
		Tiesinga, Peter J. Mohr, David B. Newell, and Barry N. Taylor
