		Computes Values for the 1-Sample Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test for
		Medians // An implementation of the 1-Sample Wilcoxon Sign rank
		test for medians. It includes 2 functions, W_stat(), which
		computes the exact probabilities of the Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test
		Statistic, W. The second function, Wilcox.m.test() allows the
		user to conduct the 1-Sample Wilcoxon Sign Rank hypothesis test
		for medians, this also allows the user to conduct the
		hypothesis test for the normal approximation, based on the
		techniques of Bickel and Doksum (1973, ISBN:013850363X).
