		Sample Size Calculator for Estimation of Population Mean and
		Proportion under SRS // It helps in determination of sample
		size for estimation of population mean and proportion based
		upon the availability of prior information on coefficient of
		variation (CV) of the population under Simple Random Sampling
		(SRS) with or without replacement sampling design. If there is
		no prior information on the population CV, then a small
		preliminary sample of size is selected to estimate the
		population CV which is then used for determination of final
		sample size. If the final sample size is more than the
		preliminary sample size, then the preliminary sample is
		augmented by drawing additional units from the remaining
		population units so that the size of the augmented sample is
		equal to the final sample size. On the other hand, if the
		preliminary sample size is larger than the final sample size,
		then the preliminary sample is considered as the final sample.
