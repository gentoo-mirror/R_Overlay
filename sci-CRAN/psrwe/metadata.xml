		PS-Integrated Methods for Incorporating RWE in Clinical Studies
		// High-quality real-world data can be transformed into
		scientific real-world evidence (RWE) for regulatory and
		healthcare decision-making using proven analytical methods and
		techniques. For example, propensity score (PS) methodology can
		be applied to pre-select a subset of real-world data containing
		patients that are similar to those in the current clinical
		study in terms of covariates, and to stratify the selected
		patients together with those in the current study into more
		homogeneous strata. Then, methods such as the power prior
		approach or composite likelihood approach can be applied in
		each stratum to draw inference for the parameters of interest.
		This package provides functions that implement the PS-
		integrated RWE analysis methods proposed in Wang et al. (2019)
