		Simulation Parameter Analysis R Toolkit ApplicatioN: Spartan //
		Computer simulations are becoming a popular technique to use in
		attempts to further our understanding of complex systems.
		SPARTAN, first described in our 2013 publication in PLoS
		Computational Biology, provided code for four techniques
		described in available literature which aid the analysis of
		simulation results, at both single and multiple timepoints in
		the simulation run. The first technique addresses aleatory
		uncertainty in the system caused through inherent
		stochasticity, and determines the number of replicate runs
		necessary to generate a representative result. The second
		examines how robust a simulation is to parameter perturbation,
		through the use of a one-at-a-time parameter analysis
		technique. Thirdly, a latin hypercube based sensitivity
		analysis technique is included which can elucidate non-linear
		effects between parameters and indicate implications of
		epistemic uncertainty with reference to the system being
		modelled. Finally, a further sensitivity analysis technique,
		the extended Fourier Amplitude Sampling Test (eFAST) has been
		included to partition the variance in simulation results
		between input parameters, to determine the parameters which
		have a significant effect on simulation behaviour. Version 1.3
		added support for Netlogo simulations, aiding simulation
		developers who use Netlogo to build their simulations perform
		the same analyses. Version 2.0 added the ability to read all
		simulations in from a single CSV file in addition to the
		prescribed folder structure in previous versions. Version 3.0
		offers significant additional functionality that permits the
		creation of emulations of simulation results, derived using the
		same sampling techniques in the global sensitivity analysis
		techniques, and the generation of combinations of these machine
		learning algorithms to one create one predictive tool, more
		commonly known as an ensemble model. Version 3.0 also improved
		the standard of the graphs produced in the original sensitivity
		analysis techniques, and introduced a polar plot to examine
		parameter sensitivity.
