		Vaccine Efficacy Over Time // Implements methods for inference on
		potential waning of vaccine efficacy and for estimation of
		vaccine efficacy at a user-specified time after vaccination
		based on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
		controlled vaccine trial in which participants may be unblinded
		and placebo subjects may be crossed over to the study vaccine.
		The methods also allow adjustment for possible confounding via
		inverse probability weighting through specification of models
		for the trial entry process, unblinding mechanisms, and the
		probability an unblinded placebo participant accepts study
		vaccine:  Tsiatis, A. A. and Davidian, M. (2021)
