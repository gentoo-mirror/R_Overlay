		Identifying Interactions Between Binary Predictors // A global
		statistical learning method which tries to find the best set of
		predictors and interactions between predictors for modeling
		binary or quantitative response data. Several search algorithms
		and ensembling techniques are implemented allowing for
		finetuning the method to the specific problem. Interactions
		with single quantitative covariables can be properly taken into
		account by also splitting after those or by fitting local four
		parameter logistic models.
