		Identifying Interactions Between Binary Predictors // A
		statistical learning method that tries to find the best set of
		predictors and interactions between predictors for modeling
		binary or quantitative response data in a decision tree.
		Several search algorithms and ensembling techniques are
		implemented allowing for finetuning the method to the specific
		problem. Interactions with quantitative covariables can be
		properly taken into account by fitting local regression models.
		Moreover, a variable importance measure for assessing marginal
		and interaction effects is provided. Implements the procedures
		proposed by Lau et al. (2024, doi:10.1007/s10994-023-06488-6).
