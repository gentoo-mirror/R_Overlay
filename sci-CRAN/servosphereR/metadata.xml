		Analyze Data Generated from Syntech Servosphere Trials //
		Functions that facilitate and speed up the analysis of data
		produced by a Syntech servosphere http://www.ockenfels-
		syntech.com/products/locomotion-compensation/, which is
		equipment for studying the movement behavior of arthropods.
		This package is designed to make working with data produced
		from a servosphere easy for someone new to or unfamiliar with
		R. The functions provided in this package fall into three
		broad-use categories: functions for cleaning raw data produced
		by the servosphere software, functions for deriving movement
		variables based on position data, and functions for summarizing
		movement variables for easier analysis. These functions are
		built with functions from the tidyverse package to work
		efficiently, as a single servosphere file may consist of
		hundreds of thousands of rows of data and a user may wish to
		analyze hundreds of files at a time. Many of the movement
		variables derivable through this package are described in the
		following papers: Otlora-Luna, Fernando; Dickens, Joseph C.
