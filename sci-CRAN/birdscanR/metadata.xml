		Migration Traffic Rate Calculation Package for 'Birdscan MR1'
		Radars // Extract data from 'Birdscan MR1' 'SQL' vertical-
		looking radar databases, filter, and process them to Migration
		Traffic Rates (#objects per hour and km) of, for example birds,
		and insects. Object classifications in the 'Birdscan MR1'
		databases are based on the dataset of Haest et al. (2021)
		doi:10.5281/zenodo.5734960). Migration Traffic Rates can be
		calculated separately for different height bins (with a height
		resolution of choice) as well as over time periods of choice
		(e.g., 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 1 day, day/night, the full time period
		of observation, and anything in between). Two plotting
		functions are also included to explore the data in the 'SQL'
		databases and the resulting Migration Traffic Rate results. For
		details on the Migration Traffic Rate calculation procedures,
		see Schmid et al. (2019) doi:10.1111/ecog.04025.
