		Clusters of Colocalized Sequences // Also abbreviates to "CCSeq".
		Finds clusters of colocalized sequences in .bed annotation
		files up to a specified cut-off distance. Two sequences are
		colocalized if they are within the cut-off distance of each
		other, and clusters are sets of sequences where each sequence
		is colocalized to at least one other sequence in the cluster.
		For a set of .bed annotation tables provided in a list along
		with a cut-off distance, the program will output a file
		containing the locations of each cluster. Annotated .bed files
		are from the 'pwmscan' application at
		https://ccg.epfl.ch/pwmtools/pwmscan.php. Personal machines
		might crash or take excessively long depending on the number of
		annotated sequences in each file and whether chromsearch() or
		gensearch() is used.
