		Data Processing after Running 'GGIR' for Accelerometer Data //
		Generate all necessary R/Rmd/shell files for data processing
		after running 'GGIR' (v2.4.0) for accelerometer data. In part
		1, all csv files in the GGIR output directory were read,
		transformed and then merged. In part 2, the GGIR output files
		were checked and summarized in one excel sheet. In part 3, the
		merged data was cleaned according to the number of valid hours
		on each night and the number of valid days for each subject. In
		part 4, the cleaned activity data was imputed by the average
		Euclidean norm minus one (ENMO) over all the valid days for
		each subject. Finally, a comprehensive report of data
		processing was created using Rmarkdown, and the report includes
		few exploratory plots and multiple commonly used features
		extracted from minute level actigraphy data.
