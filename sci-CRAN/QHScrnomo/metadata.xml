		Construct Nomogram for Competing Risk Models // Nomogram is
		constructed to predict cumulative incidence rate, which is
		calculated by adjusting for competing causes other than that of
		interest. K-fold cross-validation function is implemented to
		validate the performance. Competing risk version of concordance
		index is calculated. Methods are as described in: Kattan MW,
		Heller G, Brennan MF (2003) doi:10.1002/sim.1574.
