		Construct Nomograms for Competing Risks Regression Models //
		Nomograms are constructed to predict the cumulative incidence
		rate which is calculated after adjusting for competing causes
		to the event of interest. K-fold cross-validation is
		implemented to validate predictive accuracy using a competing-
		risk version of the concordance index. Methods are as described
		in: Kattan MW, Heller G, Brennan MF (2003)
