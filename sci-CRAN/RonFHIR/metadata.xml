		Read and Search Interface to the 'HL7 FHIR' REST API // R on FHIR
		is an easy to use wrapper around the 'HL7 FHIR' REST API (STU
		3). It provides tools to easily read and search resources on a
		FHIR server and brings the results into the R environment. R on
		FHIR is based on the FhirClient of the official 'HL7 FHIR .NET
		API', also made by Firely.
