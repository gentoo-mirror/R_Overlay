		Gene Operations for Real-Coded Genes // Representation-dependent
		gene-level operations for genetic and evolutionary algorithms
		with real-coded genes are collected in this package. The common
		feature of the gene operations is that all of them are useful
		for derivation-free optimization algorithms. At the moment the
		package implements initialization, mutation, crossover, and
		replication operations for differential evolution as described
		in Price, Kenneth V., Storn, Rainer M. and Lampinen, Jouni A.
		(2005) doi:10.1007/3-540-31306-0.  In addition, several (more
		recent) methods for determining the scale factor are provided.
