		Data Source Catalogues Online for Southern Ocean Ecosystem
		Research // Obtains lists of files of remote sensing
		collections for Southern Ocean surface properties. Commonly
		used data sources of sea surface temperature, sea ice
		concentration, and altimetry products such as sea surface
		height and sea surface currents are cached in object storage on
		the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre facility. Patterns of
		working to retrieve data from these object storage catalogues
		are described. The catalogues include complete collections of
		datasets Reynolds et al. (2008) "NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea
		Surface Temperature (OISST) Analysis, Version 2.1"
		doi:10.7289/V5SQ8XB5, Spreen et al. (2008) "Artist Advanced
		Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System
		(AMSR-E) sea ice concentration" doi:10.1029/2005JC003384. In
		future releases helpers will be added to identify particular
		data collections and target specific dates for earth
		observation data for reading, as well as helpers to retrieve
		data set citation and provenance details.  This work was
		supported by resources provided by the Pawsey Supercomputing
		Research Centre with funding from the Australian Government and
		the Government of Western Australia.  This software was
		developed by the Integrated Digital East Antarctica program of
		the Australian Antarctic Division.
