		Mocking in C++ with 'testthat' // A header only library
		integrating 'testthat' with 'trompeoeil' to provide mocking for
		C++ code in R packages. Mocking is a technique for making a
		fake version of a software service. You can mock services to
		test that your code interacts correctly with external
		interfaces, to make your tests deterministic, or to break your
		tests down into smaller units. 'testthat' provides a testing
		framework for R and C++ code in R packages. 'trompeoeil' is a
		C++ header only library for mocking.
