		Calculates the Minimum Sample Size Required for Developing a
		Multivariable Prediction Model // Computes the minimum sample
		size required for the development of a new multivariable
		prediction model using the criteria proposed by Riley et al.
		(2018) doi: 10.1002/sim.7992. pmsampsize can be used to
		calculate the minimum sample size for the development of models
		with continuous, binary or survival (time-to-event) outcomes.
		Riley et al. (2018) doi: 10.1002/sim.7992 lay out a series of
		criteria the sample size should meet. These aim to minimise the
		overfitting and to ensure precise estimation of key parameters
		in the prediction model.
