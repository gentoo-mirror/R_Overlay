		Management of Survey Data and Presentation of Analysis Results //
		An infrastructure for the management of survey data including
		value labels, definable missing values, recoding of variables,
		production of code books, and import of (subsets of) 'SPSS' and
		'Stata' files is provided. Further, the package allows to
		produce tables and data frames of arbitrary descriptive
		statistics and (almost) publication-ready tables of regression
		model estimates, which can be exported to 'LaTeX' and HTML.
