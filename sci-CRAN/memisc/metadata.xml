		Tools for Management of Survey Data and for the Presentation of
		Analysis Results // One of the aims of this package is to make
		life easier for R users who deal with survey data sets. It
		provides an infrastructure for the management of survey data
		including value labels, definable missing values, recoding of
		variables, production of code books, and import of (subsets of)
		'SPSS' and 'Stata' files. Further, it provides functionality to
		produce tables and data frames of arbitrary descriptive
		statistics and (almost) publication-ready tables of regression
		model estimates, which can be exported to 'LaTeX' and HTML.
