		Function Composition // A function composition operator to chain
		a series of calls into a single function, mimicking the math
		notion of (f o g o h)(x) = h(g(f(x))). Inspired by 'pipeOp'
		('|') since R4.1 and 'magrittr pipe' ('%%'), the operator build
		a pipe without putting data through, which is best for
		anonymous function accepted by utilities such as apply() and
		lapply().
