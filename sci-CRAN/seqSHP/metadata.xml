		Building Sequences from SHP Waves // Based on the structure of
		the SPSS version of the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) data,
		provides a function seqFromWaves() that seeks the data of
		variables specified by the user in each of the wave files and
		collects them as sequences. The function also matches the
		sequences with variables from other files such as the master
		files of persons (MP) and households (MH), and social origins
		(SO). It can also match with activity calendar data (CA).
