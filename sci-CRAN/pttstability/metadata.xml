		Particle-Takens Stability // Includes a collection of functions
		presented in "Measuring stability in ecological systems without
		static equilibria" by Clark et al. (2022) doi:10.1002/ecs2.4328
		in Ecosphere. These can be used to estimate the parameters of a
		stochastic state space model (i.e. a model where a time series
		is observed with error). The goal of this package is to
		estimate the variability around a deterministic process, both
		in terms of observation error - i.e. variability due to
		imperfect observations that does not influence system state -
		and in terms of process noise - i.e. stochastic variation in
		the actual state of the process. Unlike classical methods for
		estimating variability, this package does not necessarily
		assume that the deterministic state is fixed (i.e. a fixed-
		point equilibrium), meaning that variability around a dynamic
		trajectory can be estimated (e.g. stochastic fluctuations
		during predator-prey dynamics).
