		Segregation Analysis for Variant Interpretation // An
		implementation of the full-likelihood Bayes factor (FLB) for
		evaluating segregation evidence in clinical medical genetics.
		The method was introduced by Thompson et al. (2003)
		doi:10.1086/378100. This implementation supports custom
		penetrance values and liability classes, and allows
		visualisations and robustness analysis as presented in Ratajska
		et al. (2023) doi:10.1002/mgg3.2107. See also the online app
		'shinyseg', https://chrcarrizosa.shinyapps.io/shinyseg, which
		offers interactive segregation analysis with many additional
		features (Carrizosa et al. (2024)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btae201).
