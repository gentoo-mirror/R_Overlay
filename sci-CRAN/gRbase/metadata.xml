		A Package for Graphical Modelling in R // The 'gRbase' package
		provides graphical modelling features used by e.g. the packages
		'gRain', 'gRim' and 'gRc'. 'gRbase' implements graph algorithms
		including (i) maximum cardinality search (for marked and
		unmarked graphs). (ii) moralization, (iii) triangulation, (iv)
		creation of junction tree. 'gRbase' facilitates array
		operations, 'gRbase' implements functions for testing for
		conditional independence. 'gRbase' illustrates how hierarchical
		log-linear models may be implemented and describes concept of
		graphical meta data. The facilities of the package are
		documented in the book by Hjsgaard, Edwards and Lauritzen
		(2012, doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-2299-0) and in the paper by
		Dethlefsen and Hjsgaard, (2005, doi:10.18637/jss.v014.i17).
