		Random Snowflake Generator // The function generates and plots
		random snowflakes. Each snowflake is defined by a given
		diameter, width of the crystal, color, and random seed.
		Snowflakes are plotted in such way that they always remain
		round, no matter what the aspect ratio of the plot is.
		Snowflakes can be created using transparent colors, which
		creates a more interesting, somewhat realistic, image. Images
		of the snowflakes can be separately saved as svg files and used
		in websites as static or animated images.
