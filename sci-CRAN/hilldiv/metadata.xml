		Integral Analysis of Diversity Based on Hill Numbers // Tools for
		analysing, comparing, visualising and partitioning diversity
		based on Hill numbers. 'hilldiv' is an R package that provides
		a set of functions to assist analysis of diversity for diet
		reconstruction, microbial community profiling or more general
		ecosystem characterisation analyses based on Hill numbers,
		using OTU/ASV tables and associated phylogenetic trees as
		inputs. The package includes functions for (phylo)diversity
		measurement, (phylo)diversity profile plotting,
		(phylo)diversity comparison between samples and groups,
		(phylo)diversity partitioning and (dis)similarity measurement.
		All of these grounded in abundance-based and incidence-based
		Hill numbers. The statistical framework developed around Hill
		numbers encompasses many of the most broadly employed diversity
		(e.g. richness, Shannon index, Simpson index), phylogenetic
		diversity (e.g. Faith's PD, Allen's H, Rao's quadratic entropy)
		and dissimilarity (e.g. Sorensen index, Unifrac distances)
		metrics. This enables the most common analyses of diversity to
		be performed while grounded in a single statistical framework.
		The methods are described in Jost et al. (2007)
		DOI:10.1890/06-1736.1, Chao et al. (2010)
		DOI:10.1098/rstb.2010.0272 and Chiu et al. (2014)
		DOI:10.1890/12-0960.1; and reviewed in the framework of
		molecularly characterised biological systems in Alberdi
