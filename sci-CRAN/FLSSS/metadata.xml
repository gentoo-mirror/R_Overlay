		Mining Rigs for Problems in the Subset Sum Family // Specialized
		solvers for combinatorial optimization problems in the Subset
		Sum family. The solvers differ from the mainstream in the
		options of (i) restricting subset size, (ii) bounding subset
		elements, (iii) mining real-value multisets with predefined
		subset sum errors, (iv) finding one or more subsets in limited
		time. A novel algorithm for mining the one-dimensional Subset
		Sum induced algorithms for the multi-Subset Sum and the
		multidimensional Subset Sum. The multi-threaded framework for
		the latter offers exact algorithms to the multidimensional
		Knapsack and the Generalized Assignment problems. Historical
		updates include (a) renewed implementation of the multi-Subset
		Sum, multidimensional Knapsack and Generalized Assignment
		solvers; (b) availability of bounding solution space in the
		multidimensional Subset Sum; (c) fundamental data structure and
		architectural changes for enhanced cache locality and better
		chance of SIMD vectorization; (d) option of mapping floating-
		point instance to compressed 64-bit integer instance with user-
		controlled precision loss, which could yield substantial
		speedup due to the dimension reduction and efficient compressed
		integer arithmetic via bit-manipulations; (e) distributed
		computing infrastructure for multidimensional subset sum; (f)
		arbitrary-precision zero-margin-of-error multidimensional
		Subset Sum accelerated by a simplified Bloom filter. The
		package contains a copy of xxHash from
		https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash. Package vignette
		(arXiv:1612.04484v3) detailed a few historical updates.
		Functions prefixed with 'aux' (auxiliary) are independent
		implementations of published algorithms for solving
		optimization problems less relevant to Subset Sum.
