		Text Tokenization using Byte Pair Encoding and Unigram Modelling
		// Unsupervised text tokenizer allowing to perform byte pair
		encoding and unigram modelling. Wraps the 'sentencepiece'
		library https://github.com/google/sentencepiece which provides
		a language independent tokenizer to split text in words and
		smaller subword units. The techniques are explained in the
		paper "SentencePiece: A simple and language independent subword
		tokenizer and detokenizer for Neural Text Processing" by Taku
		Kudo and John Richardson (2018) doi:10.18653/v1/D18-2012.
		Provides as well straightforward access to pretrained byte pair
		encoding models and subword embeddings trained on Wikipedia
		using 'word2vec', as described in "BPEmb: Tokenization-free
		Pre-trained Subword Embeddings in 275 Languages" by Benjamin
		Heinzerling and Michael Strube (2018) http://www.lrec-
		conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/1049.pdf.
