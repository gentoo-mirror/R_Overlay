		A Generalized Joint Location and Scale Framework for Association
		Testing // An update to the Joint Location-Scale (JLS) testing
		framework that identifies associated SNPs, gene-sets and
		pathways with main and/or interaction effects on quantitative
		traits (Soave et al., 2015; doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.05.015).
		The JLS method simultaneously tests the null hypothesis of
		equal mean and equal variance across genotypes, by aggregating
		association evidence from the individual location/mean-only and
		scale/variance-only tests using Fisher's method. The
		generalized joint location-scale (gJLS) framework has been
		developed to deal specifically with sample correlation and
		group uncertainty (Soave and Sun, 2017;
		doi:10.1111/biom.12651). The current release: gJLS2, include
		additional functionalities that enable analyses of X-chromosome
		genotype data through novel methods for location (Chen et al.,
		2021; doi:10.1002/gepi.22422) and scale (Deng et al., 2019;
		doi:10.1002/gepi.22247).
