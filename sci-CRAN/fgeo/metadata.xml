		Analyze Forest Diversity and Dynamics // To help you access,
		transform, analyze, and visualize ForestGEO data, we developed
		a collection of R packages (https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/).
		This package, in particular, helps you to install and load the
		entire package-collection with a single R command, and provides
		convenient ways to find relevant documentation. Most commonly,
		you should not worry about the individual packages that make up
		the package-collection as you can access all features via this
		package. To learn more about ForestGEO visit
		http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/.
