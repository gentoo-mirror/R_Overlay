		Mathematical Modelling of (Dynamic) Microbial Inactivation //
		Functions for modelling microbial inactivation under isothermal
		or dynamic conditions. The calculations are based on several
		mathematical models broadly used by the scientific community
		and industry. Functions enable to make predictions for cases
		where the kinetic parameters are known. It also implements
		functions for parameter estimation for isothermal and dynamic
		conditions. The model fitting capabilities include an Adaptive
		Monte Carlo method for a Bayesian approach to parameter
		estimation.
