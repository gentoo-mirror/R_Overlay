		N-Factor Commodity Pricing Through Term Structure Estimation //
		Commodity pricing models are (systems of) stochastic
		differential equations that are utilized for the valuation and
		hedging of commodity contingent claims (i.e. derivative
		products on the commodity) and other commodity related
		investments. Commodity pricing models that capture market
		dynamics are of great importance to commodity market
		participants in order to exercise sound investment and risk-
		management strategies. Parameters of commodity pricing models
		are estimated through maximum likelihood estimation, using
		available term structure futures data of a commodity. 'NFCP'
		(n-factor commodity pricing) provides a framework for the
		modeling, parameter estimation, probabilistic forecasting,
		option valuation and simulation of commodity prices through
		state space and Monte Carlo methods, risk-neutral valuation and
		Kalman filtering. 'NFCP' allows the commodity pricing model to
		consist of n correlated factors, with both random walk and
		mean-reverting elements. The n-factor commodity pricing model
		framework was first presented in the work of Cortazar and
		Naranjo (2006) doi:10.1002/fut.20198. Examples presented in
		'NFCP' replicate the two-factor crude oil commodity pricing
		model presented in the prolific work of Schwartz and Smith
		(2000) doi:10.1287/mnsc.46.7.893.12034 with the approximate
		term structure futures data applied within this study provided
		in the 'NFCP' package.
