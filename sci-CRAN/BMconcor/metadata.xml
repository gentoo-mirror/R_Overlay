		CONCOR for Structural- And Regular-Equivalence Blockmodeling //
		The four functions svdcp() ('cp' for column partitioned),
		svdbip() or svdbip2() ('bip' for bipartitioned), and svdbips()
		('s' for a simultaneous optimization of a set of 'r'
		solutions), correspond to a singular value decomposition (SVD)
		by blocks notion, by supposing each block depending on relative
		subspaces, rather than on two whole spaces as usual SVD does.
		The other functions, based on this notion, are relative to two
		column partitioned data matrices x and y defining two sets of
		subsets x_i and y_j of variables and amount to estimate a link
		between x_i and y_j for the pair (x_i, y_j) relatively to the
		links associated to all the other pairs. These methods were
		first presented in: Lafosse R.  Hanafi M.,(1997)
		https://eudml.org/doc/106424 and Hanafi M.  Lafosse, R. (2001)
		https://eudml.org/doc/106494.
