		Plot Raster Images Interactively on a Plain HTML Canvas //
		Provides methods for plotting potentially large (raster) images
		interactively on a plain HTML canvas. In contrast to package
		'mapview' data are plotted without background map, but data can
		be projected to any spatial coordinate reference system.
		Supports plotting of classes 'RasterLayer', 'RasterStack',
		'RasterBrick' (from package 'raster') as well as 'png' files
		located on disk. Interactivity includes zooming, panning, and
		mouse location information. In case of multi-layer
		'RasterStacks' or 'RasterBricks', RGB image plots are created
		(similar to 'raster::plotRGB' - but interactive).
