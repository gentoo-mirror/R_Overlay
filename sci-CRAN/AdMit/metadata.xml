		Adaptive Mixture of Student-t Distributions // Provides functions
		to perform the fitting of an adaptive mixture of Student-t
		distributions to a target density through its kernel function
		as described in Ardia et al. (2009) doi:10.18637/jss.v029.i03.
		The mixture approximation can then be used as the importance
		density in importance sampling or as the candidate density in
		the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain quantities of
		interest for the target density itself.
