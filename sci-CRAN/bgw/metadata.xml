		Bunch-Gay-Welsch Statistical Estimation // Performs statistical
		estimation and inference-related computations by accessing and
		executing modified versions of 'Fortran' subroutines originally
		published in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
		journal Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS) by Bunch,
		Gay and Welsch (1993) doi:10.1145/151271.151279. The acronym
		'BGW' (from the authors' last names) will be used when making
		reference to technical content (e.g., algorithm, methodology)
		that originally appeared in ACM TOMS. A key feature of BGW is
		that it exploits the special structure of statistical
		estimation problems within a trust-region-based optimization
		approach to produce an estimation algorithm that is much more
		effective than the usual practice of using optimization methods
		and codes originally developed for general optimization. The
		'bgw' package bundles 'R' wrapper (and related) functions with
		modified 'Fortran' source code so that it can be compiled and
		linked in the 'R' environment for fast execution. This version
		implements a function ('bgw_mle.R') that performs maximum
		likelihood estimation (MLE) for a user-provided model object
		that computes probabilities (a.k.a. probability densities). The
		motivation for producing this initial version is to provide
		fast, efficient, and reliable MLE for discrete choice models
		that can be called from the 'Apollo' choice modelling 'R'
		package: see http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com. However,
		estimation can also be performed in a stand-alone fashion
		without using 'Apollo' (as shown in simple examples). After
		this initial version is available on CRAN, an updated version
		of 'Apollo' (0.2.9) will be made available that automatically
		loads 'bgw'. Additional development can then occur, including
		more detailed examples in 'bgw' that refer to 'Apollo.' Note
		also that BGW capabilities are not limited to MLE, and future
		extension to other estimators (e.g., nonlinear least squares,
		generalized method of moments, etc.) is possible. The 'Fortran'
		code included in 'bgw' was modified by one of the original BGW
		authors (Bunch) under his rights as confirmed by direct
		consultation with the ACM Intellectual Property and Rights
		Manager.  See https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/author-
		rights. The main requirement is clear citation of the original
		publication (see above).
