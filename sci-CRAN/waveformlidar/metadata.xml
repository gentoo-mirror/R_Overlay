		Waveform LiDAR Data Processing and Analysis // A wealth of Full
		Waveform (FW) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are
		available to the public from different sources, which is poised
		to boost the extensive application of FW LiDAR data. However,
		we lack a handy and open source tool that can be used by
		ecological and remote sensing communities for processing and
		analyzing FW LiDAR data. To this end, we introduce
		'waveformlidar', an R package dedicated to FW LiDAR processing,
		analysis and visualization as a solution to the constraint.
		Specifically, this package provides several commonly used
		waveform processing methods such as Gaussian, adaptive Gaussian
		and Weibull decompositions, and deconvolution approaches (Gold
		and Richard-Lucy (RL)) with customized settings. In addition,
		we also develop some functions to derive commonly used waveform
		metrics for characterizing vegetation structure. Moreover, a
		new way to directly visualize FW LiDAR data is developed
		through converting waveforms into points to form the Hyper
		Point cloud (HPC), which can be easily adopted and subsequently
		analyzed with existing discrete-return LiDAR processing tools
		such as 'LAStools' and 'FUSION'. Basic explorations of the HPC
		such as 3D voxelization of the HPC and conversion from original
		waveforms to composite waveforms are also available in this
		package. All of these functions are developed based on small-
		footprint FW LiDAR data, but they can be easily transplanted to
		the large footprint FW LiDAR data such as Geoscience Laser
		Altimeter System (GLAS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics
		Investigation (GEDI) data analysis. References: Zhou et al.
