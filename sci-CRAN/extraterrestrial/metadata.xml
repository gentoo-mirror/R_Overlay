		Astrobiology Equations Estimating Extraterrestrial Life //
		Finding life outside the planet Earth several is the ultimate
		goal of an astrobiologist. Using known astronomical
		measurements and assumptions the probability of
		extraterrestrial life existence could be estimated. Equations
		such as the Drake equation (1961) as stated in the paper of
		Molina (2019) arXiv:1912.01783, Seager (2013)
		https://www.space.com/22648-drake-equation-alien-life-
		seager.html and Foucher et al, (2017) doi:10.3390/life7040040
		are included in the 'extraterrestrial' package.
