		Genetic Algorithm for Wind Farm Layout Optimization // The
		genetic algorithm is designed to optimize small wind farms with
		irregular shapes. The algorithm works with a fixed amount of
		turbines, a fixed rotor radius and a mean wind speed value for
		every incoming wind direction. If required, it can include a
		terrain effect model which downloads an 'SRTM' elevation model
		automatically and loads a Corine Land Cover raster, which has
		to be downloaded previously. Further information can be found
		in the description of the function 'windfarmGA'. To start an
		optimization run, either the function 'windfarmGA' or 'genAlgo'
		can be used. The function 'windfarmGA' checks the user inputs
		interactively and then runs the function 'genAlgo'. If the
		input parameters are already known, an optimization can be run
		directly via the function 'genAlgo'. Their output is identical.
