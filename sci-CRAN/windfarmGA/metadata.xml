		Genetic Algorithm for Wind Farm Layout Optimization // The
		genetic algorithm is designed to optimize wind farms of any
		shape. It requires a predefined amount of turbines, a unified
		rotor radius and an average wind speed value for each incoming
		wind direction. A terrain effect model can be included that
		downloads an 'SRTM' elevation model and loads a Corine Land
		Cover raster to approximate surface roughness.
