		Cyclic Redundancy Check with CPU-Specific Acceleration //
		Hardware-based support for 'CRC32C' cyclic redundancy checksum
		function is made available for 'x86_64' systems with 'SSE2'
		support as well as for 'arm64', and detected at build-time via
		'cmake' with a software-based fallback.  This functionality is
		exported at the 'C'-language level for use by other packages.
		'CRC32C' is described in 'RFC 3270' at
		https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3720 and is based on
		'Castagnoli et al' doi:10.1109/26.231911.
