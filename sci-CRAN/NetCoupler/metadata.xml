		Inference of Causal Links Between a Network and an External
		Variable // The 'NetCoupler' algorithm identifies potential
		direct effects of correlated, high-dimensional variables formed
		as a network with an external variable. The external variable
		may act as the dependent/response variable or as an
		independent/predictor variable to the network.
