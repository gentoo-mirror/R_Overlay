		Colorblind-Friendly Color Maps (Lite Version) // Color maps
		designed to improve graph readability for readers with common
		forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The
		color maps are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form
		and also when converted to black-and-white for printing. This
		is the 'lite' version of the 'viridis' package that also
		contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous color
		and fill scales and can be found at
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis.
