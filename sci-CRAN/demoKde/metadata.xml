		Kernel Density Estimation for Demonstration Purposes //
		Demonstration code showing how (univariate) kernel density
		estimates are computed, at least conceptually, and allowing
		users to experiment with different kernels, should they so
		wish.  The method used follows directly the definition, but
		gains efficiency by replacing the observations by frequencies
		in a very fine grid covering the sample range.  A canonical
		reference is B. W. Silverman, (1998) doi:
		10.1201/9781315140919. NOTE: the density function in the stats
		package uses a more sophisticated method based on the fast
		Fourier transform and that function should be used if
		computational efficiency is a prime consideration.
