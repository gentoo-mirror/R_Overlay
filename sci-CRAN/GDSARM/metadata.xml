		Gauss - Dantzig Selector: Aggregation over Random Models // The
		method aims to identify important factors in screening
		experiments by aggregation over random models as studied in
		Singh and Stufken (2022) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2205.13497. This
		package provides functions to run the Gauss-Dantzig selector on
		screening experiments when interactions may be affecting the
		response. Currently, all functions require each factor to be at
		two levels coded as +1 and -1.
