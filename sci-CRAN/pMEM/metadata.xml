		Predictive Moran's Eigenvector Maps // Calculation of Predictive
		Moran's eigenvector maps (pMEM), as defined by Gunard and
		Legendre (In Press) "Spatially-explicit predictions using
		spatial eigenvector maps" doi:10.5281/zenodo.13356457. Methods
		in Ecology and Evolution. This method enables scientists to
		predict the values of spatially-structured environmental
		variables. Multiple types of pMEM are defined, each one
		implemented on the basis of spatial weighting function taking a
		range parameter, and sometimes also a shape parameter. The
		code's modular nature enables programers to implement new pMEM
		by defining new spatial weighting functions.
