		Antiassociative Algebra // Methods to deal with the free
		antiassociative algebra over the reals with an arbitrary number
		of indeterminates. Antiassociativity means that (xy)z = -x(yz).
		Antiassociative algebras are nilpotent with nilindex four
		(Remm, 2022, doi:10.48550/arXiv.2202.10812) and this drives the
		design and philosophy of the package.  Methods are defined to
		create and manipulate arbitrary elements of the antiassociative
		algebra, and to extract and replace coefficients.  A vignette
		is provided.
