		Selection by Partitioning the Solution Paths // An implementation
		of the feature Selection procedure by Partitioning the entire
		Solution Paths (namely SPSP) to identify the relevant features
		rather than using a single tuning parameter. By utilizing the
		entire solution paths, this procedure can obtain better
		selection accuracy than the commonly used approach of selecting
		only one tuning parameter based on existing criteria, cross-
		validation (CV), generalized CV, AIC, BIC, and extended BIC
		(Liu, Y.,  Wang, P. (2018) doi:10.1214/18-EJS1434). It is more
		stable and accurate (low false positive and false negative
		rates) than other variable selection approaches. In addition,
		it can be flexibly coupled with the solution paths of Lasso,
		adaptive Lasso, ridge regression, and other penalized
		estimators.
