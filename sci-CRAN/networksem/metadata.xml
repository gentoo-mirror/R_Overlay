		Network Structural Equation Modeling // Several methods have been
		developed to integrate structural equation modeling techniques
		with network data analysis to examine the relationship between
		network and non-network data. Both node-based and edge-based
		information can be extracted from the network data to be used
		as observed variables in structural equation modeling. To
		facilitate the application of these methods, model
		specification can be performed in the familiar syntax of the
		'lavaan' package, ensuring ease of use for researchers.
		Technical details and examples can be found at
