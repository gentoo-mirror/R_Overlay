		Dynamic Time Warping Algorithms // A comprehensive implementation
		of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithms in R.  DTW computes
		the optimal (least cumulative distance) alignment between
		points of two time series.  Common DTW variants covered include
		local (slope) and global (window) constraints, subsequence
		matches, arbitrary distance definitions, normalizations,
		minimum variance matching, and so on.  Provides cumulative
		distances, alignments, specialized plot styles, etc., as
		described in Giorgino (2009) doi:10.18637/jss.v031.i07.
