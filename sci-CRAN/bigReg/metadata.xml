		Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for Large Data Sets // Allows the
		user to carry out GLM on very large data sets. Data can be
		created using the data_frame() function and appended to the
		object with object$append(data); data_frame and data_matrix
		objects are available that allow the user to store large data
		on disk. The data is stored as doubles in binary format and any
		character columns are transformed to factors and then stored as
		numeric (binary) data while a look-up table is stored in a
		separate .meta_data file in the same folder. The data is stored
		in blocks and GLM regression algorithm is modified and carries
		out a MapReduce- like algorithm to fit the model. The functions
		bglm(), and summary() and bglm_predict() are available for
		creating and post-processing of models. The library requires
		Armadillo installed on your system. It may not function on
		windows since multi-core processing is done using mclapply()
		which forks R on Unix/Linux type operating systems.
