		Pedigree, Genetic Merit, Phenotype, and Genotype Simulation //
		Simulate pedigree, genetic merits and phenotypes with
		random/non-random matings followed by random/non-random
		selection with different intensities and patterns in males and
		females. Genotypes can be simulated for a given pedigree, or an
		appended pedigree to an existing pedigree with genotypes.
