		Geographically-Weighted Models // Techniques from a particular
		branch of spatial statistics,termed geographically-weighted
		(GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not
		described well by some global model, but where there are
		spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides
		a better description. 'GWmodel' includes functions to
		calibrate: GW summary statistics (Brunsdon et al., 2002)doi:
		10.1016/s0198-9715(01)00009-6, GW principal components analysis
		(Harris et al., 2011)doi: 10.1080/13658816.2011.554838, GW
		discriminant analysis (Brunsdon et al., 2007)doi:
		10.1111/j.1538-4632.2007.00709.x and various forms of GW
		regression (Brunsdon et al., 1996)doi:
		10.1111/j.1538-4632.1996.tb00936.x; some of which are provided
		in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms.
