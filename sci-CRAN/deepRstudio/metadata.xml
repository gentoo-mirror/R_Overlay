		Seamless Language Translation in 'RStudio' using 'DeepL' API and
		'Rstudioapi' // Enhancing cross-language compatibility within
		the 'RStudio' environment and supporting seamless language
		understanding, the 'deepRstudio' package leverages the power of
		the 'DeepL' API (see https://www.deepl.com/docs-api) to enable
		seamless, fast, accurate, and affordable translation of code
		comments, documents, and text. This package offers the ability
		to translate selected text into English (EN), as well as from
		English into various languages, namely Japanese (JA), Chinese
		(ZH), Spanish (ES), French (FR), Russian (RU), Portuguese (PT),
		and Indonesian (ID). With much of the text being written in
		English, the emphasis is on compatibility from English. It is
		also designed for developers working on multilingual projects
		and data analysts collaborating with international teams,
		simplifying the translation process and making code more
		accessible and comprehensible to people with diverse language
		backgrounds. This package uses the 'rstudioapi' package and
		'DeepL' API, and is simply implemented, executed from addins or
		via shortcuts on 'RStudio'. With just a few steps, content can
		be translated between supported languages, promoting better
		collaboration and expanding the global reach of work. The
		functionality of this package works only on 'RStudio' using
		'rstudioapi'.
