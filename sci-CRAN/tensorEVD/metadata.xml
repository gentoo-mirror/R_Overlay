		A Fast Algorithm to Factorize High-Dimensional Tensor Product
		Matrices // Here we provide tools for the computation and
		factorization of high-dimensional tensor products that are
		formed by smaller matrices. The methods are based on properties
		of Kronecker products (Searle 1982, p. 265, ISBN-10:
		0470009616). We evaluated this methodology by benchmark testing
		and illustrated its use in Gaussian Linear Models ('Lopez-Cruz
		et al., 2024') doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkae001.
