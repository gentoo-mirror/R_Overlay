		Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling // Conditioned Latin
		hypercube sampling, as published by Minasny and McBratney
		(2006) DOI:10.1016/j.cageo.2005.12.009. This method proposes to
		stratify sampling in presence of ancillary data. An extension
		of this method, which propose to associate a cost to each
		individual and take it into account during the optimisation
		process, is also proposed (Roudier et al., 2012,
		DOI:10.1201/b12728).
