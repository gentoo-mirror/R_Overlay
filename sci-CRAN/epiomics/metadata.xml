		Analysis of Omics Data in Observational Studies // A collection
		of fast and flexible functions for analyzing omics data in
		observational studies. Multiple different approaches for
		integrating environmental/genetic factors, omics data, and/or
		phenotype data are implemented. This includes functions for
		performing omics wide association studies with one or more
		variables of interest as the exposure or outcome; a function
		for performing a meet in the middle analysis for linking
		exposures, omics, and outcomes (as described by Chadeau-Hyam et
		al., (2010) doi:10.3109/1354750X.2010.533285); and a function
		for performing a mixtures analysis across all omics features
		using quantile-based g-Computation (as described by Keil et
		al., (2019) doi:10.1289/EHP5838).
