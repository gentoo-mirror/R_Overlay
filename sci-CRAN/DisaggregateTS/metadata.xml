		High-Dimensional Temporal Disaggregation // Provides tools for
		temporal disaggregation, including: (1) High-dimensional and
		low-dimensional series generation for simulation studies; (2) A
		toolkit for temporal disaggregation and benchmarking using low-
		dimensional indicator series as proposed by Dagum and Cholette
		(2006, ISBN:978-0-387-35439-2); (3) Novel techniques by Mosley,
		Gibberd, and Eckley (2022, doi:10.1111/rssa.12952) for
		disaggregating low-frequency series in the presence of high-
		dimensional indicator matrices.
