		High-Dimensional Temporal Disaggregation // First - Generates
		(potentially high-dimensional) high-frequency and low-frequency
		series for simulation studies in temporal disaggregation;
		Second - a toolkit utilizing temporal disaggregation and
		benchmarking techniques with a low-dimensional matrix of
		indicator series previously proposed in Dagum and Cholette
		(2006, ISBN:978-0-387-35439-2) ; and Third - novel techniques
		proposed by Mosley, Gibberd and Eckley (2021) arXiv:2108.05783
		for disaggregating low-frequency series in the presence of
		high-dimensional indicator matrices.
