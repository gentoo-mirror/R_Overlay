		Simple Toolkit in R for ANomalies Get, Explain and Report //
		Framework for unsupervised anomalies detection that simplifies
		the user experience because the one does not need to be
		concerned with the many packages and functions that are
		required. Package 'stranger' acts as a wrapper around existing
		packages ("a la 'caret' for modeling") and provides a clean and
		uniform toolkit for evaluation/explain/reporting purposes.
