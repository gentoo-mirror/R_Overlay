		Bayesian Probit Choice Modeling // Bayes estimation of probit
		choice models in cross-sectional and panel settings. The
		package can analyze binary, multivariate, ordered, and ranked
		choices, as well as heterogeneity of choice behavior among
		deciders. The main functionality includes model fitting via
		Gibbs sampling, tools for convergence  diagnostic, choice data
		simulation, in-sample and out-of-sample choice prediction, and
		model selection using information criteria and Bayes factors.
		The latent class model extension facilitates preference-based
		decider classification, where the number of latent classes can
		be inferred via the Dirichlet process or a weight-based
		updating heuristic. This allows for flexible modeling of choice
		behavior without the need to impose structural constraints. For
		a reference on the method, see Oelschlaeger and Bauer (2021)
