		May All Data be Reproducible and Transparent (MADRaT) * //
		Provides a framework which should improve reproducibility and
		transparency in data processing. It provides functionality such
		as automatic meta data creation and management, rudimentary
		quality management, data caching, work-flow management and data
		aggregation. * The title is a wish not a promise. By no means
		we expect this package to deliver everything what is needed to
		achieve full reproducibility and transparency, but we believe
		that it supports efforts in this direction.
