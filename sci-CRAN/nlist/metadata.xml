		Lists of Numeric Atomic Objects // Create and manipulate numeric
		list ('nlist') objects.  An 'nlist' is an S3 list of uniquely
		named numeric objects. An numeric object is an integer or
		double vector, matrix or array.  An 'nlists' object is a S3
		class list of 'nlist' objects with the same names,
		dimensionalities and typeofs.  Numeric list objects are of
		interest because they are the raw data inputs for analytic
		engines such as 'JAGS', 'STAN' and 'TMB'.  Numeric lists
		objects, which are useful for storing multiple realizations of
		of simulated data sets, can be converted to coda::mcmc and
		coda::mcmc.list objects.
