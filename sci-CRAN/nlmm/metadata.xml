		Generalized Laplace Mixed-Effects Models // Provides functions to
		fit linear mixed models based on convolutions of the
		generalized Laplace (GL) distribution. The GL mixed-effects
		model includes four special cases with normal random effects
		and normal errors (NN), normal random effects and Laplace
		errors (NL), Laplace random effects and normal errors (LN), and
		Laplace random effects and Laplace errors (LL). The methods are
		described in Geraci and Farcomeni (2020, Statistical Methods in
		Medical Research) doi:10.1177/0962280220903763.
