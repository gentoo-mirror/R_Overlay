		Diffusion Model of Conflict (DMC) in Reaction Time Tasks // DMC
		model simulation detailed in Ulrich, R., Schroeter, H.,
		Leuthold, H.,  Birngruber, T. (2015). Automatic and controlled
		stimulus processing in conflict tasks: Superimposed diffusion
		processes and delta functions. Cognitive Psychology, 78,
		148-174. Ulrich et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2015.02.005. Decision processes within
		choice reaction-time (CRT) tasks are often modelled using
		evidence accumulation models (EAMs), a variation of which is
		the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM, for a review, see Ratcliff
		McKoon, 2008). Ulrich et al. (2015) introduced a Diffusion
		Model for Conflict tasks (DMC). The DMC model combines common
		features from within standard diffusion models with the
		addition of superimposed controlled and automatic activation.
		The DMC model is used to explain distributional reaction time
		(and error rate) patterns in common behavioural conflict-like
		tasks (e.g., Flanker task, Simon task). This R-package
		implements the DMC model and provides functionality to fit the
		model to observed data. Further details are provided in the
		following paper: Mackenzie, I.G.,  Dudschig, C. (2021). DMCfun:
		An R package for fitting Diffusion Model of Conflict (DMC) to
		reaction time and error rate data. Methods in Psychology,
