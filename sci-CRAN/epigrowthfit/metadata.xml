		Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models of Epidemic Growth // Maximum
		likelihood estimation of nonlinear mixed effects models of
		epidemic growth using Template Model Builder ('TMB').  Enables
		joint estimation for collections of disease incidence time
		series, including time series that describe multiple epidemic
		waves. Supports a set of widely used phenomenological models:
		exponential, logistic, Richards (generalized logistic),
		subexponential, and Gompertz.  Provides methods for
		interrogating model objects and several auxiliary functions,
		including one for computing basic reproduction numbers from
		fitted values of the initial exponential growth rate.
		Preliminary versions of this software were applied in Ma et al.
