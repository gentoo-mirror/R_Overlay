		Spatio-Dynamic Wetland Plant Communities Model // A spatio-
		dynamic modelling package that focuses on three characteristic
		wetland plant communities in a semiarid Mediterranean wetland
		in response to hydrological pressures from the catchment. The
		package includes the data on watershed hydrological pressure
		and the initial raster maps of plant communities but also
		allows for random initial distribution of plant communities.
