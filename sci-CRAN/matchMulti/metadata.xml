		Optimal Multilevel Matching using a Network Algorithm // Performs
		multilevel matches for data with cluster-level treatments and
		individual-level outcomes using a network optimization
		algorithm.  Functions for checking balance at the cluster and
		individual levels are also provided, as are methods for
		permutation-inference-based outcome analysis.  Details in
		Pimentel et al. (2017+), forthcoming in the Annals of Applied
		Statistics.
