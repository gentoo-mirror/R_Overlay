		Optimal Multilevel Matching using a Network Algorithm // Performs
		multilevel matches for data with cluster- level treatments and
		individual-level outcomes using a network optimization
		algorithm.  Functions for checking balance at the cluster and
		individual levels are also provided, as are methods for
		permutation-inference-based outcome analysis.  Details in
		Pimentel et al. (2018) doi:10.1214/17-AOAS1118.  The optmatch
		package, which is useful for running many of the provided
		functions, may be downloaded from Github at
		https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch if not available
