		Generating Triangular and Trapezoidal Fuzzy Random Numbers via
		Uniform Distribution // Triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy
		numbers are used to study fuzzy logic, fuzzy reasoning and
		approximating, fuzzy regression models, etc. This package
		builds the generating function for triangular and trapezoidal
		fuzzy numbers based on Souliotis et al.
		(2022)doi:10.3390/math10183350. They proposed a method for the
		construction of fuzzy numbers via a cumulative distribution
		function based on the possibility theory.
