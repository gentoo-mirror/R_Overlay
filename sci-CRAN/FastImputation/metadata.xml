		Learn from Training Data then Quickly Fill in Missing Data //
		TrainFastImputation() uses training data to describe a
		multivariate normal distribution that the data approximates or
		can be transformed into approximating and stores this
		information as an object of class 'FastImputationPatterns'.
		FastImputation() function uses this 'FastImputationPatterns'
		object to impute (make a good guess at) missing data in a
		single line or a whole data frame of data.  This approximates
		the process used by 'Amelia' https://gking.harvard.edu/amelia
		but is much faster when filling in values for a single line of
		data.
