		A Simple and Flexible Switch-Case Construct for the 'R' Language
		// Provides a switch-case construct for 'R', as it is known
		from other programming languages. It allows to test multiple,
		similar conditions in an efficient, easy-to-read manner, so
		nested if-else constructs can be avoided. The switch-case
		construct is designed as an 'R' function that allows to return
		values depending on which condition is met and lets the
		programmer flexibly decide whether or not to leave the switch-
		case construct after a case block has been executed.
