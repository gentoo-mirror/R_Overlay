		Genomic Selection using Single Trait // Genomic Selection (GS) is
		a latest development in animal and plant breeding where whole
		genome markers information is used to predict genetic merit of
		an individuals in a practical breeding programme. GS is one of
		the promising tool for improving genetic gain in animal and
		plants in todays scenario. This package is basically developed
		for genomic predictions by estimating marker effects. These
		marker effects further used for calculation of genotypic merit
		of individual i.e. genome estimated breeding values (GEBVs).
		Genomic selection may be based on single trait or multi traits
		information. This package performs genomic selection only for
		single traits hence named as STGS i.e. single trait genomic
		selection. STGS is a comprehensive package which gives single
		step solution for genomic selection based on most commonly used
		statistical methods.
