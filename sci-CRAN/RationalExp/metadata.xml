		Rationalizing Rational Expectations. Tests and Deviations // We
		implement a test of the rational expectations hypothesis based
		on the marginal distributions of realizations and subjective
		beliefs from D'Haultfoeuille, Gaillac, and Maurel (2018)
		doi:10.3386/w25274. This test can be used in cases where
		realizations and subjective beliefs are observed in two
		different datasets that cannot be matched, or when they are
		observed in the same dataset. The package also computes the
		estimator of the minimal deviations from rational expectations
		than can be rationalized by the data.
