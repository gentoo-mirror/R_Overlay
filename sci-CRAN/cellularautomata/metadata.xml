		Cellular Automata // Create cellular automata from 'Wolfram'
		rules. Allows the creation of 'Wolfram' style plots, as well as
		of animations. Easy to create multiple plots, for example the
		output of a rule with different initial states, or the output
		of many different rules from the same state. The output of a
		cellular automaton is given as a matrix, making it easy to try
		to explore the possibility of predicting its time evolution
		using various statistical tools available in R. Wolfram S.
