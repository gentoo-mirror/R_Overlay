		Dependence Condition Test Using Ranked Correlation Coefficients
		// A common misconception is that the Hochberg procedure comes
		up with adequate overall type I error control when test
		statistics are positively correlated. However, unless the test
		statistics follow some standard distributions, the Hochberg
		procedure requires a more stringent positive dependence
		assumption, beyond mere positive correlation, to ensure valid
		overall type I error control. To fill this gap, we formulate
		statistical tests grounded in rank correlation coefficients to
		validate fulfillment of the positive dependence through
		stochastic ordering (PDS) condition. See Gou, J., Wu, K. and
		Chen, O. Y. (2024). Rank correlation coefficient based tests on
		positive dependence through stochastic ordering with
		application in cancer studies, Technical Report.
