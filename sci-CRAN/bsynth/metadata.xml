		Bayesian Synthetic Control // Implements the Bayesian Synthetic
		Control method for causal inference in comparative case
		studies. This package provides tools for estimating treatment
		effects in settings with a single treated unit and multiple
		control units, allowing for uncertainty quantification and
		flexible modeling of time-varying effects. The methodology is
		based on the paper by Vives and Martinez (2022)
