		Stochastic 3D Structure Model for Binder-Conductive Additive
		Phase // Simulation of the stochastic 3D structure model for
		the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery
		cathodes introduced in P. Grfensteiner, M. Osenberg, A. Hilger,
		N. Bohn, J. R. Binder, I. Manke, V. Schmidt, M. Neumann (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2409.11080. The model is developed for a
		binder-conductive additive phase of consisting of carbon black,
		polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For
		its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on
		methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite
		particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal
		grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is
		modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the
		complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions
		within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by
		a Boolean model with spherical grains.
