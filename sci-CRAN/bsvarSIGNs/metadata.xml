		Bayesian SVARs with Sign, Zero, and Narrative Restrictions //
		Implements state-of-the-art algorithms for the Bayesian
		analysis of Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVARs)
		identified by sign, zero, and narrative restrictions. The core
		model is based on a flexible Vector Autoregression with
		estimated hyper-parameters of the Minnesota prior and the dummy
		observation priors as in Giannone, Lenza, Primiceri (2015)
		doi:10.1162/REST_a_00483. The sign restrictions are implemented
		employing the methods proposed by Rubio-Ramrez, Waggoner  Zha
		(2010) doi:10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00578.x, while
		identification through sign and zero restrictions follows the
		approach developed by Arias, Rubio-Ramrez,  Waggoner (2018)
		doi:10.3982/ECTA14468. Furthermore, our tool provides
		algorithms for identification via sign and narrative
		restrictions, in line with the methods introduced by Antoln-Daz
		and Rubio-Ramrez (2018) doi:10.1257/aer.20161852. Users can
		also estimate a model with sign, zero, and narrative
		restrictions imposed at once. The package facilitates
		predictive and structural analyses using impulse responses,
		forecast error variance and historical decompositions,
		forecasting and conditional forecasting, as well as analyses of
		structural shocks and fitted values. All this is complemented
		by colourful plots, user-friendly summary functions, and
		comprehensive documentation including the vignette by Wang
		Woniak (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2501.16711. The 'bsvarSIGNs'
		package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code
		structure with the R package 'bsvars' by Woniak (2024)
		doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvars, and they constitute an
		integrated toolset. It was granted the Di Cook Open-Source
		Statistical Software Award by the Statistical Society of
		Australia in 2024.
