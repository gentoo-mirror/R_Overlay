		Consensus Clustering for Different Sample Coverage Data //
		Consensus clustering, also called meta-clustering or cluster
		ensembles, has been increasingly used in clinical data. Current
		consensus clustering methods tend to ensemble a number of
		different clusters from mathematical replicates with similar
		sample coverage. As the fact of common variety of sample
		coverage in the real-world data, a new consensus clustering
		strategy dealing with such biological replicates is required.
		This is a two-step consensus clustering package, which is used
		to input multiple predictive labels with different sample
		coverage (missing labels).
