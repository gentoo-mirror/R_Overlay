		Evapotranspiration Simulation and Soil Water Balance under Field
		// Supports the calculation of meteorological characteristics
		in evapotranspiration research and reference crop
		evapotranspiration, and offers three models to simulate crop
		evapotranspiration and soil water balance in the field,
		including single crop coefficient and dual crop coefficient, as
		well as the Shuttleworth-Wallace model. These calculations main
		refer to Allen et al.(1998, ISBN:92-5-104219-5), Teh (2006,
		ISBN:1-58-112-998-X), and Liu et al.(2006)
