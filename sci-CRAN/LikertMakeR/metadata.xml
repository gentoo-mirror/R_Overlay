		Synthesise and Correlate Rating-Scale Data // Synthesise and
		correlate rating-scale data with predefined first  second
		moments and, optionally, predefined correlation matrix. The
		function, `lexact()`, uses the 'DEoptim'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DEoptim package, described
		in Mullen, Ardia, Gil, Windover,  Cline (2011)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i06, to synthesise a vector of discrete
		values with predefined mean and standard deviation exact to two
		decimal places, if feasible. The function, `lfast()`, draws a
		random sample from a _Beta_ distribution which is rescaled to
		give a vector with approximate first and second moments. It is
		much faster than `lexact()` but not as precise. The function,
		`lcor()`, systematically swaps values within each column of a
		data-frame so that they are correlated to fit a predefined
		correlation matrix.
