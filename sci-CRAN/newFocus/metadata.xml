		True Discovery Guarantee by Combining Partial Closed Testings //
		Closed testing has been proved powerful for true discovery
		guarantee. The computation of closed testing is, however, quite
		burdensome. A general way to reduce computational complexity is
		to combine partial closed testings for some prespecified
		feature sets of interest. Partial closed testings are performed
		at Bonferroni-corrected alpha level to guarantee the lower
		bounds for the number of true discoveries in prespecified sets
		are simultaneously valid. For any post hoc chosen sets of
		interest, coherence property is used to get the lower bound. In
		this package, we implement closed testing with globaltest to
		calculate the lower bound for number of true discoveries, see
		Ningning Xu et.al (2021) arXiv:2001.01541 for detailed
		description.
