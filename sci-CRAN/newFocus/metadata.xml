		True Discovery Guarantee by the New Focus Level Procedure // A
		new focus level procedure is developed based on the old focus
		level procedure of Goeman and Mansmann (2008)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm628 and the closed testing
		procedure with globaltest of Xu and Goeman (2020)
		arXiv:2001.01541. It produces the lower bound for the number of
		true discoveries in any gene set or GO (Gene Ontology) term. It
		is more powerful for the focus level GO terms chosen by user
		before seeing the data than the non-focus level GO terms or
		gene sets chosen after seeing the data.
