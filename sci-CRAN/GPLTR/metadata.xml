		Generalized Partially Linear Tree-Based Regression Model //
		Combining a generalized linear model with an additional tree
		part on the same scale. A four-step procedure is proposed to
		fit the model and test the joint effect of the selected tree
		part while adjusting on confounding factors. We also proposed
		an ensemble procedure based on the bagging to improve
		prediction accuracy and computed several scores of importance
		for variable selection. See 'Cyprien Mbogning et
		al.'(2014)doi:10.1186/2043-9113-4-6 and 'Cyprien Mbogning et
		al.'(2015)doi:10.1159/000380850 for an overview of all the
		methods implemented in this package.
