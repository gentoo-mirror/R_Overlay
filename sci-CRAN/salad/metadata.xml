		Simple Automatic Differentiation // Handles both vector and
		matrices, using a flexible S4 class for automatic
		differentiation. The method used is forward automatic
		differentiation. Many functions and methods have been defined,
		so that in most cases, functions written without automatic
		differentiation in mind can be used without change.
