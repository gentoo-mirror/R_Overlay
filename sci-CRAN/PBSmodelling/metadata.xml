		GUI Tools Made Easy: Interact with Models and Explore Data //
		Provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and
		operation of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools
		that make it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical
		user interface ('GUI'). Although our simplified 'GUI' language
		depends heavily on the R interface to the 'Tcl/Tk' package, a
		user does not need to know 'Tcl/Tk'. Examples illustrate models
		built with other R packages, including 'PBSmapping',
		'PBSddesolve', and 'BRugs'. A complete user's guide
		'PBSmodelling-UG.pdf' shows how to use this package
		effectively.
