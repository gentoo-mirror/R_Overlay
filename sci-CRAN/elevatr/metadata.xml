		Access Elevation Data from Various APIs // Several web services
		are available that provide access to elevation data. This
		package provides access to several of those services and
		returns elevation data either as a SpatialPointsDataFrame from
		point elevation services or as a raster object from raster
		elevation services.  Currently, the package supports access to
		the Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles
		https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/, the Open
		Topography Global Datasets API
		https://opentopography.org/developers/, and the USGS Elevation
		Point Query Service https://nationalmap.gov/epqs/.
