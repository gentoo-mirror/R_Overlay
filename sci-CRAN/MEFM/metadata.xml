		Perform MEFM Estimation on Matrix Time Series // To perform main
		effect matrix factor model (MEFM) estimation for a given matrix
		time series as described in Lam and Cen (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.00128. Estimation of traditional matrix
		factor models is also supported. Supplementary functions for
		testing MEFM over factor models are included.
