		Estimate Pollinator Body Size and Co-Varying Ecological Traits //
		Tools to estimate pollinator body size and co-varying traits.
		This package contains novel Bayesian predictive models of
		pollinator body size (for bees and hoverflies) as well as
		preexisting predictive models for pollinator body size
		(currently implemented for ants, bees, butterflies, flies,
		moths and wasps) as well as bee tongue length and foraging
		distance, total field nectar loads and wing loading. An
		additional GitHub repository
		https://github.com/liamkendall/pollimetrydata provides model
		objects to use the bodysize function internally. All models are
		described in Kendall et al (2018) doi:10.1101/397604.
