		PCA on the Torus via Density Ridges // Implementation of a
		Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the torus via density
		ridge estimation. The main function, ridge_pca(), obtains the
		relevant density ridge for bivariate sine von Mises and
		bivariate wrapped Cauchy distribution models and provides the
		associated scores and variance decomposition. Auxiliary
		functions for evaluating, fitting, and sampling these models
		are also provided. The package provides replicability to Garca-
		Portugus and Prieto-Tirado (2022) arXiv:2212.10856.
