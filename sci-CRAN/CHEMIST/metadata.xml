		Causal Inference with High-Dimensional Error-Prone Covariates and
		Misclassified Treatments // We aim to deal with the average
		treatment effect (ATE), where the data are subject to high-
		dimensionality and measurement error. This package primarily
		contains two functions, which are used to generate artificial
		data and estimate ATE with high-dimensional and error-prone
		data accommodated.
