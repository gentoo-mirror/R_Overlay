		Validation of Local and Remote Data Tables // Validate data in
		data frames, 'tibble' objects, in 'CSV' and 'TSV' files, and in
		database tables ('PostgreSQL' and 'MySQL'). Validation
		pipelines can be made using easily-readable, consecutive
		validation steps and such pipelines allow for switching of the
		data table context. Upon execution of the validation plan,
		several reporting options are available. User-defined
		thresholds for failure rates allow for the determination of
		appropriate reporting actions.
