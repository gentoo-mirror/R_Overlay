		Data Validation and Organization of Metadata for Local and Remote
		Tables // Validate data in data frames, 'tibble' objects,
		'Spark' 'DataFrames', and database tables. Validation pipelines
		can be made using easily-readable, consecutive validation
		steps. Upon execution of the validation plan, several reporting
		options are available. User-defined thresholds for failure
		rates allow for the determination of appropriate reporting
		actions. Many other workflows are available including an
		information management workflow, where the aim is to record,
		collect, and generate useful information on data tables.
