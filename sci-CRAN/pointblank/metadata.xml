		Validation of Local and Remote Data Tables // Validate data in
		data frames, 'tibble' objects, and in database tables (e.g.,
		'PostgreSQL' and 'MySQL'). Validation pipelines can be made
		using easily-readable, consecutive validation steps. Upon
		execution of the validation plan, several reporting options are
		available. User-defined thresholds for failure rates allow for
		the determination of appropriate reporting actions.
