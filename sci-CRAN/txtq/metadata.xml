		A Small Message Queue for Parallel Processes // This queue is a
		data structure that lets parallel processes send and receive
		messages, and it can help coordinate the work of complicated
		parallel tasks. Processes can push new messages to the queue,
		pop old messages, and obtain a log of all the messages ever
		pushed. File locking preserves the integrity of the data even
		when multiple processes access the queue simultaneously.
