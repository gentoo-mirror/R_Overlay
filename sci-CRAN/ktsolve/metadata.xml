		Configurable Function for Solving Families of Nonlinear Equations
		// This is designed for use with an arbitrary set of equations
		with an arbitrary set of unknowns. The user selects "fixed"
		values for enough unknowns to leave as many variables as there
		are equations, which in most cases means the system is properly
		defined and a unique solution exists. The function, the fixed
		values and initial values for the remaining unknowns are fed to
		a nonlinear backsolver. The original version of "TK!Solver" ,
		now a product of Universal Technical Systems
		(https://www.uts.com) was the inspiration for this function.
