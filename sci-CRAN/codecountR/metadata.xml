		Counting Codes in a Text and Preparing Data for Analysis // Data
		analysis frequently requires coding, in particular when data
		are collected by interviews, by observations or even by
		questionnaires. Therefore, code counting and data preparation
		are necessary phases to carry out the analysis. Thus, the
		analysts will wish to count the codes inserted in a text
		(tokenization and counting of a list of pre-established codes)
		and to carry out the preparation of the data (feature scaling
		min-max normalization, Zscore, Box and Cox transformation, non
		parametric bootstrap). For Box and Cox (1964)
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984418 transformation, optimal
		Lambda is calculated by log-likelihood. Non parametric
		bootstrap is based on randomly sampling data with replacement.
		Package for educational purposes.
