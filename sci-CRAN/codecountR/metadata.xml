		Counting Codes in a Text and Preparing Data for Analysis // Data
		analysis frequently requires coding, in particular when data
		are collected by interviews, by observations or even by
		questionnaires. Therefore, code counting and data preparation
		are necessary phases to carry out the analysis. Thus, the
		analysts will wish to count the codes inserted in a text
		(tokenization and counting of a list of pre-established codes)
		and to carry out the preparation of the data (feature scaling
		min-max normalization, Zscore, Box and Cox transformation, Yeo
		and Johnson transformation, median absolute deviation). For Box
		and Cox (1964) https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984418
		transformation, optimal Lambda is calculated by correlation
		coefficient test inspired of Lye (1993) doi:10.1139/l93-101.
		The same method is used for the calculation of the optimal
		lambda for Yeo and Johnson (2000) doi:10.1093/biomet/87.4.954
		transformation. Median absolute deviation is calculated on the
		basis of Leys et al (1993) doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2013.03.013.
		Package for educational purposes.
