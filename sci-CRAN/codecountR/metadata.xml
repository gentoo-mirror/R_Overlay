		Counting Codes in a Text and Preparing Data for Analysis // Data
		analysis often requires coding, especially when data are
		collected through interviews, observations, or questionnaires.
		As a result, code counting and data preparation are essential
		steps in the analysis process. Analysts may need to count the
		codes in a text (tokenization and counting of pre-established
		codes) and prepare the data (e.g., min-max normalization,
		Z-score, robust scaling, Box-Cox transformation, and non-
		parametric bootstrap). For the Box-Cox transformation (Box
		Cox, 1964, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984418), the optimal
		Lambda is determined using the log-likelihood method. Non-
		parametric bootstrap involves randomly sampling data with
		replacement. Two random number generators are also integrated:
		a Lehmer congruential generator for uniform distribution and a
		Box-Muller generator for normal distribution. Package for
		educational purposes.
