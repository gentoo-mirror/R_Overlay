		Semi-Supervised Learning via Gaussian Mixture Model // The
		algorithm of semi-supervised learning for a partially
		classified sample via Gaussian mixture model with the missing-
		label mechanism is designed for a fitting g-component Gaussian
		mixture model via maximum likelihood (ML). The classifier is
		proposed to treat the labels of the unclassified features as
		missing-data and to introduce a framework for their missing as
		in the pioneering work of Rubin (1976) for missing in
		incomplete data analysis. It suggests that the missingness of
		the labels of the features can be modelled by representing the
		probability of a missing-label for a feature via the logistic
		model depending on the entropy of the feature or an appropriate
		proxy for it.
