		Semi-Supervised Gaussian Mixture Model with a Missing-Data
		Mechanism // The algorithm of semi-supervised learning based on
		finite Gaussian mixture models with a missing-data mechanism is
		designed for a fitting g-class Gaussian mixture model via
		maximum likelihood (ML). It is proposed to treat the labels of
		the unclassified features as missing-data and to introduce a
		framework for their missing as in the pioneering work of Rubin
		(1976) for missing in incomplete data analysis. This dependency
		in the missingness pattern can be leveraged to provide
		additional information about the optimal classifier as
		specified by Bayes rule.
