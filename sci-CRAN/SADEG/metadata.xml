		Stability Analysis in Differentially Expressed Genes // We
		analyzed the nucleotide composition of genes with a special
		emphasis on stability of DNA sequences. Besides, in a variety
		of different organisms unequal use of synonymous codons, or
		codon usage bias, occurs which also show variation among genes
		in the same genome. Seemingly, codon usage bias is affected by
		both selective constraints and mutation bias which allows and
		enables us to examine and detect changes in these two
		evolutionary forces between genomes or along one genome.
		Therefore, we determined the codon adaptation index (CAI),
		effective number of codons (ENC) and codon usage analysis with
		calculation of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and
		subsequently predicted the translation efficiency and accuracy
		through GC-rich codon usages. Furthermore, we estimated the
		relative stability of the DNA sequence following calculation of
		the average free energy (Delta G) and Dimer base-stacking
		energy level.
