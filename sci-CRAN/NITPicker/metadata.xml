		Finds the Best Subset of Points to Sample // Given a few examples
		of experiments over a time (or spatial) course, 'NITPicker'
		selects a subset of points to sample in follow-up experiments,
		which would (i) best distinguish between the experimental
		conditions and the control condition (ii) best distinguish
		between two models of how the experimental condition might
		differ from the control (iii) a combination of the two. Ezer
		and Keir (2018) doi:10.1101/301796.
