		Basic Wavelet Routines for One-, Two-, and Three-Dimensional
		Signal Processing // Basic wavelet routines for time series
		(1D), image (2D) and array (3D) analysis.  The code provided
		here is based on wavelet methodology developed in Percival and
		Walden (2000); Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); the dual-
		tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) from Kingsbury (1999,
		2001) as implemented by Selesnick; and Hilbert wavelet pairs
		(Selesnick 2001, 2002). All figures in chapters 4-7 of GSW
		(2001) are reproducible using this package and R code available
		at the book website(s) below.
