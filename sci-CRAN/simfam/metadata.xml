		Simulate and Model Family Pedigrees with Structured Founders //
		The focus is on simulating and modeling families with founders
		drawn from a structured population (for example, with different
		ancestries or other potentially non-family relatedness), in
		contrast to traditional pedigree analysis that treats all
		founders as equally unrelated.  Main function simulates a
		random pedigree for many generations, avoiding close relatives,
		pairing closest individuals according to a 1D geography and
		their randomly-drawn sex, and with variable children sizes to
		result in a target population size per generation.  Auxiliary
		functions calculate kinship matrices, admixture matrices, and
		draw random genotypes across arbitrary pedigree structures
		starting from the corresponding founder values.  The code is
		built around the plink FAM table format for pedigrees.
