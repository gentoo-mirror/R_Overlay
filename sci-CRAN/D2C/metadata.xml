		Predicting Causal Direction from Dependency Features // The
		relationship between statistical dependency and causality lies
		at the heart of all statistical approaches to causal inference.
		The D2C package implements a supervised machine learning
		approach to infer the existence of a directed causal link
		between two variables in multivariate settings with n2
		variables. The approach relies on the asymmetry of some
		conditional (in)dependence relations between the members of the
		Markov blankets of two variables causally connected. The D2C
		algorithm predicts the existence of a direct causal link
		between two variables in a multivariate setting by (i) creating
		a set of of features of the relationship based on asymmetric
		descriptors of the multivariate dependency and (ii) using a
		classifier to learn a mapping between the features and the
		presence of a causal link
