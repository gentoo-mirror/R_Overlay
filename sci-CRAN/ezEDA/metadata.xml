		Task Oriented Interface for Exploratory Data Analysis // Enables
		users to create visualizations using functions based on the
		data analysis task rather than on plotting mechanics. It hides
		the details of the individual 'ggplot2' function calls and
		allows the user to focus on the end goal. Useful for quick
		preliminary explorations. Provides functions for common
		exploration patterns. Some of the ideas in this package are
		motivated by Fox (2015, ISBN:1938377052).
