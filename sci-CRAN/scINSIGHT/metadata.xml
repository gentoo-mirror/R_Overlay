		Interpretation of Heterogeneous Single-Cell Gene Expression Data
		// We develop a novel matrix factorization tool named
		'scINSIGHT' to jointly analyze multiple single-cell gene
		expression samples from biologically heterogeneous sources,
		such as different disease phases, treatment groups, or
		developmental stages. Given multiple gene expression samples
		from different biological conditions, 'scINSIGHT'
		simultaneously identifies common and condition-specific gene
		modules and quantify their expression levels in each sample in
		a lower-dimensional space. With the factorized results, the
		inferred expression levels and memberships of common gene
		modules can be used to cluster cells and detect cell
		identities, and the condition-specific gene modules can help
		compare functional differences in transcriptomes from distinct
		conditions.
