		The Directed Prediction Index for Causal Inference from
		Observational Data // The Directed Prediction Index ('DPI') is
		a quasi-causal inference (causal discovery) method for
		observational data designed to quantify the relative
		endogeneity (relative dependence) of outcome (Y) versus
		predictor (X) variables in regression models. By comparing the
		proportion of variance explained (R-squared) between the Y-as-
		outcome model and the X-as-outcome model while controlling for
		a sufficient number of possible confounders, it can suggest a
		plausible (admissible) direction of influence from a more
		exogenous variable (X) to a more endogenous variable (Y).
		Methodological details are provided at
		https://psychbruce.github.io/DPI/. This package also provides
		functions for data simulation and network analysis
		(correlation, partial correlation, and Bayesian networks).
