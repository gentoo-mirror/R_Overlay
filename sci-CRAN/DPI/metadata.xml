		The Directed Prediction Index for Quasi-Causal Inference with
		Cross-Sectional Data // The Directed Prediction Index ('DPI')
		is a quasi-causal inference method for cross-sectional data
		designed to quantify the relative endogeneity (relative
		dependence) of outcome (Y) versus predictor (X) variables in
		regression models. By comparing the proportion of variance
		explained (R-squared) between the Y-as-outcome model and the
		X-as-outcome model while controlling for a sufficient number of
		possible confounders, it suggests a plausible (admissible)
		direction of influence from a more exogenous variable (X) to a
		more endogenous variable (Y). Methodological details are
		provided at https://psychbruce.github.io/DPI/.
