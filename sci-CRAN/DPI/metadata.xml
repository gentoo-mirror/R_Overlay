		The Directed Prediction Index // The Directed Prediction Index
		('DPI') is a simulation-based and conservative method for
		quantifying the relative endogeneity (relative dependence) of
		outcome (Y) versus predictor (X) variables in multiple linear
		regression models. By comparing the proportion of variance
		explained (R-squared) between the Y-as-outcome model and the
		X-as-outcome model while controlling for a sufficient number of
		potential confounding variables, it suggests a more plausible
		influence direction from a more exogenous variable (X) to a
		more endogenous variable (Y). Methodological details are
		provided at https://psychbruce.github.io/DPI/.
