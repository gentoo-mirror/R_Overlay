		Tools for Poisson Data // Functions used for analyzing count
		data, mostly crime counts. Includes checking difference in two
		Poisson counts (e-test), checking the fit for a Poisson
		distribution, small sample tests for counts in bins, Weighted
		Displacement Difference test (Wheeler and Ratcliffe, 2018)
		doi:10.1186/s40163-018-0085-5, to evaluate crime changes over
		time in treated/control areas. Additionally includes functions
		for aggregating spatial data and spatial feature engineering.
