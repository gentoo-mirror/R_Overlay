		G-Computation to Estimate Interpretable Epidemiological Effects
		// Estimates flexible epidemiological effect measures including
		both differences and ratios using the parametric G-formula
		developed as an alternative to inverse probability weighting.
		It is useful for estimating the impact of interventions in the
		presence of treatment-confounder-feedback. G-computation was
		originally described by Robbins (1986)
		doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6 and has been described in
		detail by Ahern, Hubbard, and Galea (2009)
