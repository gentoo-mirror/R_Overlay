		Time-Varying Garch Models Through a State-Space Representation //
		Estimates the time-varying (tv) parameters of the GARCH(1,1)
		model, enabling the modeling of non-stationary volatilities by
		allowing the model parameters to change gradually over time.
		The estimation and prediction processes are facilitated through
		the application of the Kalman filter and state-space equations.
		This package supports the estimation of tv parameters for
		various deterministic functions, which can be identified
		through exploratory analysis of different time periods or
		segments of return data. The methodology is grounded in the
		framework presented by Ferreira et al. (2017)
