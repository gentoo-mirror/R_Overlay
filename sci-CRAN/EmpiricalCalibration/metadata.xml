		Routines for Performing Empirical Calibration of Observational
		Study Estimates // Routines for performing empirical
		calibration of observational study estimates. By using a set of
		negative control hypotheses we can estimate the empirical null
		distribution of a particular observational study setup. This
		empirical null distribution can be used to compute a calibrated
		p-value, which reflects the probability of observing an
		estimated effect size when the null hypothesis is true taking
		both random and systematic error into account. A similar
		approach can be used to calibrate confidence intervals, using
		both negative and positive controls. For more details, see
		Schuemie et al. (2013) doi:10.1002/sim.5925 and Schuemie et al.
