		Comprehensive Automatized Evaluation of Distribution Models for
		Count Data // A large number of measurements generate count
		data. This is a statistical data type that only assumes non-
		negative integer values and is generated by counting.
		Typically, counting data can be found in biomedical
		applications, such as the analysis of DNA double-strand breaks.
		The number of DNA double-strand breaks can be counted in
		individual cells using various bioanalytical methods. For
		diagnostic applications, it is relevant to record the
		distribution of the number data in order to determine their
		biomedical significance (Roediger, S. et al., 2018. Journal of
		Laboratory and Precision Medicine.
		doi:10.21037/jlpm.2018.04.10). The software offers functions
		for a comprehensive automated evaluation of distribution models
		of count data. In addition to programmatic interaction, a
		graphical user interface (web server) is included, which
		enables fast and interactive data-scientific analyses. The user
		is supported in selecting the most suitable counting
		distribution for his own data set.
