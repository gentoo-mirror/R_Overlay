		Fit GLM's with High-Dimensional k-Way Fixed Effects // Provides a
		routine to concentrate out factors with many levels during the
		optimization of the log-likelihood function of the
		corresponding generalized linear model (glm). The package is
		based on the algorithm proposed by Stammann (2018)
		arXiv:1707.01815 and is restricted to glm's that are based on
		maximum likelihood estimation and non-linear. It also offers an
		efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects
		in a post-estimation routine. The package also includes robust
		and multi-way clustered standard errors.
