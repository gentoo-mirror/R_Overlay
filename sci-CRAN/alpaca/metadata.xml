		Fit GLM's with High-Dimensional k-Way Fixed Effects // Provides a
		routine to partial out factors with many levels during the
		optimization of the log-likelihood function of the
		corresponding generalized linear model (glm). The package is
		based on the algorithm described in Stammann (2018)
		arXiv:1707.01815 and is restricted to glm's that are based on
		maximum likelihood estimation and non-linear. It also offers an
		efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects
		in a post-estimation routine and includes robust and multi-way
		clustered standard errors. Further the package provides
		analytical bias corrections for binary choice models (logit and
		probit) derived by Fernandez-Val and Weidner (2016)
		doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.12.014 and Hinz, Stammann, and
		Wanner (2020) arXiv:2004.12655.
