		Bayesian Latent Space Model // Provides a Bayesian latent space
		model for complex networks, either weighted or unweighted.
		Given an observed input graph, the estimates for the latent
		coordinates of the nodes are obtained through a Bayesian MCMC
		algorithm. The overall likelihood of the graph depends on a
		fundamental probability equation, which is defined so that ties
		are more likely to exist between nodes whose latent space
		coordinates are close. The package is mainly based on the model
		by Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002)
		doi:10.1198/016214502388618906 and contains some extra features
		(e.g., removal of the Procrustean step, weights implemented as
		coefficients of the latent distances, 3D plots). The original
		code related to the above model was retrieved from https://www.
		stat.washington.edu/people/pdhoff/Code/hoff_raftery_handcock_20
		02_jasa/. Users can inspect the MCMC simulation, create and
		customize insightful graphical representations or apply
		clustering techniques.
