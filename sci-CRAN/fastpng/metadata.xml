		Read and Write PNG Files with Configurable Decoder/Encoder
		Options // Read and write PNG images with arrays, rasters,
		native rasters, numeric arrays, integer arrays, raw vectors and
		indexed values.  This PNG encoder exposes configurable internal
		options enabling the user to select a speed-size tradeoff.  For
		example, disabling compression can speed up writing PNG by a
		factor of 50. Multiple image formats are supported including
		raster, native rasters, and integer and numeric arrays at color
		depths of 1, 2, 3 or 4. 16-bit images are also supported. This
		implementation uses the 'libspng' 'C' library which is
		available from https://github.com/randy408/libspng/.
