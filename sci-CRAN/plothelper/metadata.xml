		New Plots Based on 'ggplot2' and Functions to Create Regular
		Shapes // An extension to 'ggplot2' with miscellaneous
		functions. It contains two groups of functions: Functions in
		the first group draw 'ggplot2' - based plots: gg_shading_bar()
		draws barplot with shading colors in each bar. geom_rect_cm(),
		geom_circle_cm() and geom_ellipse_cm() draw rectangles, circles
		and ellipses with centimeter as their unit. Thus their sizes do
		not change when the coordinate system or the aspect ratio
		changes. annotation_transparent_text() draws labels with
		transparent texts. annotation_shading_polygon() draws irregular
		polygons with shading colors. Functions in the second group
		generate coordinates for regular shapes and make linear
		transformations.
