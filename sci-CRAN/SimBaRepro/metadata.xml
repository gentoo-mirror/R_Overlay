		Simulation-Based, Finite-Sample Inference via Repro Samples //
		Functions for obtaining p-values (for hypothesis tests),
		confidence intervals, and multivariate confidence sets. In
		particular, the method is compatible with differentially
		private dataset, as long as the privacy mechanism is known. For
		more details, see Awan and Wang (2024), "Simulation-based,
		Finite-sample Inference for Privatized Data",
