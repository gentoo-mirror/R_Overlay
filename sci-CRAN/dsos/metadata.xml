		Dataset Shift with Outlier Scores // Test for no adverse shift in
		two-sample comparison when we have a training set, the
		reference distribution, and a test set. The approach is
		flexible and relies on a robust and powerful test statistic,
		the weighted AUC. Technical details are in Kamulete, V. M.
		(2021) arXiv:1908.04000. Modern notions of outlyingness such as
		trust scores and prediction uncertainty can be used as the
		underlying scores for example.
