		Dataset Shift with Outlier Scores // Test for no adverse shift in
		two-sample comparison when we have a training set, the
		reference distribution, and a test set. The approach is
		flexible (extensible) and relies on a robust and powerful test
		statistic, the weighted AUC. See Kamulete, V. M. (2021)
		arXiv:2107.02990 for details. Outlier scores such as trust
		scores and prediction uncertainty can be used as the basis for
		comparison for example.
