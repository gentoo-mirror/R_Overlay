		Repertoire Analysis of the Detected Clonotype // The 'TRUST4' or
		'MiXCR' is used to identify the clonotypes. The goal of
		'rTCRBCRr' is to process the results from these clonotyping
		tools, and analyze the clonotype repertoire metrics based on
		chain names and IGH isotypes. The manuscript is still under
		preparation for publication for now. The references describing
		the methods in this package will be added later.
