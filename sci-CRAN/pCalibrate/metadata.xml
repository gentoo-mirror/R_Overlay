		Bayesian Calibrations of P-Values // Implements transformations
		of P-values to the smallest possible Bayes factor within the
		specified class of alternative hypotheses, as described in Held
		Ott (2017, On p-values and Bayes factors, Annual Review of
		Statistics and Its Application, 5, to appear). Covers several
		common testing scenarios such as z-tests, t-tests, likelihood
		ratio tests and the F-test of overall significance in the
		linear model.
