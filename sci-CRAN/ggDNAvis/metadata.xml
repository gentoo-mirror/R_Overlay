		'ggplot2'-Based Tools for Visualising DNA Sequences and
		Modifications // Uses 'ggplot2' to visualise either (a) a
		single DNA/RNA sequence split across multiple lines, (b)
		multiple DNA/RNA sequences, each occupying a whole line, or (c)
		base modifications such as DNA methylation called by modified
		bases models in Dorado or Guppy. Functions starting with
		visualise_something() are the main plotting functions, and
		functions starting with extract_something() are key helper
		functions for reading files and reformatting data. Source code
		is available at https://github.com/ejade42/ggDNAvis and a full
		non-expert user guide is available at
		https://ejade42.github.io/ggDNAvis/.
