		A Minimal Wrapper Around NIH's 'iCite' API // A minimal wrapper
		around the NIH's 'iCite' API (https://icite.od.nih.gov/api).
		Given a vector of pubmed IDs, this package returns a dataframe
		of the information yielded by the 'iCite' API. The primary
		metrics yielded by 'iCite' are measurements of a paper's
		scientific influence and translational potential, but the API
		also returns other meta-data from the paper, including author
		names, publication journal, publication year, paper title, doi,
		and a number of other citation metrics.
