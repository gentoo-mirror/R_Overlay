		Analytic Solutions for (Ground-Water) Boussinesq Equation // A
		collection of R functions were implemented from published and
		available analytic solutions for the One-Dimensional Boussinesq
		Equation (ground-water). In particular, the function
		"beq.lin()" is the analytic solution of the linearized form of
		Boussinesq Equation between two different head-based boundary
		(Dirichlet) conditions; "beq.song" is the non-linear power-
		series analytic solution of the motion of a wetting front over
		a dry bedrock (Song at al, 2007, see complete reference on
		function documentation). Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration
		of any kind are warmly welcomed.
