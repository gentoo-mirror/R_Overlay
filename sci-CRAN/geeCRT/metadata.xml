		Bias-Corrected GEE for Cluster Randomized Trials // Population-
		averaged models have been increasingly used in the design and
		analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs). To facilitate the
		applications of population-averaged models in CRTs, the package
		implements the generalized estimating equations (GEE) and
		matrix-adjusted estimating equations (MAEE) approaches to
		jointly estimate the marginal mean models correlation models
		both for general CRTs and stepped wedge CRTs. Despite the
		general GEE/MAEE approach, the package also implements a fast
		cluster-period GEE method specifically for stepped wedge CRTs
		with large and variable cluster-period sizes and gives a simple
		and efficient estimating equations approach based on the
		cluster-period means to estimate the intervention effects as
		well as correlation parameters. In addition, the package also
		provides functions for generating correlated binary data with
		specific mean vector and correlation matrix based on the
		multivariate probit method in Emrich and Piedmonte (1991)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.1991.10475828 or the conditional linear
		family method in Qaqish (2003) doi:10.1093/biomet/90.2.455.
