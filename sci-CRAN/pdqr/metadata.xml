		Work with Custom Distribution Functions // Create, transform, and
		summarize custom random variables with distribution functions
		(analogues of 'p*()', 'd*()', 'q*()', and 'r*()' functions from
		base R). Two types of distributions are supported: "discrete"
		(random variable has finite number of output values) and
		"continuous" (infinite number of values in the form of
		continuous random variable). Functions for distribution
		transformations and summaries are available. Implemented
		approaches often emphasize approximate and numerical solutions:
		all distributions assume finite support and finite values of
		density function; some methods implemented with simulation
		techniques.
