		Sample Size Calculation for Mean and Proportion Comparisons in
		Phase 3 Clinical Trials // The design of phase 3 clinical
		trials can be classified into 4 types: (1) Testing for
		equality;(2) Superiority trial;(3) Non-inferiority trial; and
		(4) Equivalence trial according to the goals. Given that none
		of the available packages combines these designs in a single
		package, this package has made it possible for researchers to
		calculate sample size when comparing means or proportions in
		phase 3 clinical trials with different designs. The ssc
		function can calculate the sample size with pre-specified type
		1 error rate,statistical power and effect size according to the
		hypothesis testing framework. Furthermore, effect size is
		comprised of true treatment difference and non-inferiority or
		equivalence margins which can be set in ssc function.
