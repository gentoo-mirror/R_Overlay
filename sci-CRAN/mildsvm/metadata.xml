		Multiple-Instance Learning with Support Vector Machines // Weakly
		supervised (WS), multiple instance (MI) data lives in numerous
		interesting applications such as drug discovery, object
		detection, and tumor prediction on whole slide images. The
		'mildsvm' package provides an easy way to learn from this data
		by training Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifiers. It
		also contains helpful functions for building and printing
		multiple instance data frames. The core methods from 'mildsvm'
		come from the following references: Kent and Yu (2022)
		arXiv:2206.14704; Xiao, Liu, and Hao (2018)
		doi:10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2766164; Muandet et al. (2012) https://p
		roceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/9bf31c7ff062936a96d3c8bd1
		f8f2ff3-Paper.pdf; Chu and Keerthi (2007)
		doi:10.1162/neco.2007.19.3.792; and Andrews et al. (2003)
		https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2232-support-vector-machines-for-
		multiple-instance-learning.pdf. Many functions use the 'Gurobi'
		optimization back-end to improve the optimization problem
		speed; the 'gurobi' R package and associated software can be
		downloaded from https://www.gurobi.com after obtaining a
		license.
