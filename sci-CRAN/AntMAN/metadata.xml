		Anthology of Mixture Analysis Tools // Fits finite Bayesian
		mixture models with a random number of components. The MCMC
		algorithm implemented is based on point processes as proposed
		by Argiento and De Iorio (2019) arXiv:1904.09733 and offers a
		more computationally efficient alternative to reversible jump.
		Different mixture kernels can be specified: univariate
		Gaussian, multivariate Gaussian, univariate Poisson, and
		multivariate Bernoulli (latent class analysis). For the
		parameters characterising the mixture kernel, we specify
		conjugate priors, with possibly user specified hyper-
		parameters. We allow for different choices for the prior on the
		number of components: shifted Poisson, negative binomial, and
		point masses (i.e. mixtures with fixed number of components).
