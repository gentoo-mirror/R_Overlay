		Bayesian Estimation of the Force of Infection from Serological
		Data // Estimating the force of infection from time varying,
		age varying, or constant serocatalytic models from population
		based seroprevalence studies using a Bayesian framework,
		including data simulation functions enabling the generation of
		serological surveys based on this models. This tool also
		provides a flexible prior specification syntax for the force of
		infection and the seroreversion rate, as well as methods to
		assess model convergence and comparison criteria along with
		useful visualisation functions.
