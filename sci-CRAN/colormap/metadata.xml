		Color Palettes using Colormaps Node Module // Allows to generate
		colors from palettes defined in the colormap module of
		'Node.js'. (see https://github.com/bpostlethwaite/colormap for
		more information). In total it provides 44 distinct palettes
		made from sequential and/or diverging colors. In addition to
		the pre defined palettes you can also specify your own set of
		colors. There are also scale functions that can be used with
		'ggplot2'.
