		Read, Write and Edit XLSX Files // Simplifies the creation of
		Excel .xlsx files by providing a high level interface to
		writing, styling and editing worksheets. Through the use of
		Rcpp, read/write times are comparable to the xlsx and XLConnect
		packages with the added benefit of removing the dependency on
		Java.
