		Read, Write and Edit xlsx Files // Simplifies the creation of
		Excel .xlsx files by providing a high level interface to
		writing, styling and editing worksheets. Through the use of
		'Rcpp', read/write times are comparable to the 'xlsx' and
		'XLConnect' packages with the added benefit of removing the
		dependency on Java.
