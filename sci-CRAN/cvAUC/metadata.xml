		Cross-Validated Area Under the ROC Curve Confidence Intervals //
		Tools for working with and evaluating cross-validated area
		under the ROC curve (AUC) estimators.  The primary functions of
		the package are ci.cvAUC and ci.pooled.cvAUC, which report
		cross-validated AUC and compute confidence intervals for cross-
		validated AUC estimates based on influence curves for i.i.d.
		and pooled repeated measures data, respectively.  One benefit
		to using influence curve based confidence intervals is that
		they require much less computation time than bootstrapping
		methods.  The utility functions, AUC and cvAUC, are simple
		wrappers for functions from the ROCR package.
