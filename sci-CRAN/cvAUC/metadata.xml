		Cross-Validated Area Under the ROC Curve Confidence Intervals //
		This package contains various tools for working with and
		evaluating cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC)
		estimators.  The primary functions of the package are ci.cvAUC
		and ci.pooled.cvAUC, which report cross-validated AUC and
		compute confidence intervals for cross-validated AUC estimates
		based on influence curves for i.i.d. and pooled repeated
		measures data, respectively.  One benefit to using influence
		curve based confidence intervals is that they require much less
		computation time than bootstrapping methods.  The utility
		functions, AUC and cvAUC, are simple wrappers for functions
		from the ROCR package.
