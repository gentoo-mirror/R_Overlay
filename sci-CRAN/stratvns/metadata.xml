		Optimal Stratification in Stratified Sampling Optimization
		Algorithm // An Optimization Algorithm Applied to
		stratification Problem. It is aims to delimit the population
		strata and defining the allocation of sample,considering the
		following objective: minimize the sample size given a fixed
		precision level. Exhaustive enumeration method is applied in
		small problems, while in problems with greater complexity the
		algorithm is based on metaheuristic Variable Neighborhood
		Decomposition Search with Path Relink.
