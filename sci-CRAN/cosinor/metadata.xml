		Tools for Estimating and Predicting the Cosinor Model // A set of
		simple functions that transforms longitudinal data to estimate
		the cosinor linear model as described in Tong (1976). Methods
		are given to summarize the mean, amplitude and acrophase, to
		predict the mean annual outcome value, and to test the
		coefficients.
