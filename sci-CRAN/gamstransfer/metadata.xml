		A Data Interface Between 'GAMS' and R // Read, analyze, modify,
		and write 'GAMS' (General Algebraic Modeling System) data. The
		main focus of 'gamstransfer' is the highly efficient transfer
		of data with 'GAMS' https://www.gams.com/, while keeping these
		operations as simple as possible for the user. The transfer of
		data usually takes place via an intermediate GDX (GAMS Data
		Exchange) file. Additionally, 'gamstransfer' provides utility
		functions to get an overview of 'GAMS' data and to check its
		validity.
