		Variable Selection in High-Dimensional Logistic Regression Models
		using a Whitening Approach // It proposes a novel variable
		selection approach in classification problem that takes into
		account the correlations that may exist between the predictors
		of the design matrix in a high-dimensional logistic model. Our
		approach consists in rewriting the initial high-dimensional
		logistic model to remove the correlation between the predictors
		and in applying the generalized Lasso criterion.
