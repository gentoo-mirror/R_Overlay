		Whitening Logistic Regression for Variable Selection // It
		proposes a novel variable selection approach in classification
		problem that takes into account the correlations that may exist
		between the predictors of the design matrix in a high-
		dimensional logistic model. Our approach consists in rewriting
		the initial high-dimensional logistic model to remove the
		correlation between the predictors and in applying the
		generalized Lasso criterion. For further details we refer the
		reader to the paper Zhu et al. (2022) arXiv:2206.14850.
