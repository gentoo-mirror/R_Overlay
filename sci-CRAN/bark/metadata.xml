		Bayesian Additive Regression Kernels // Bayesian Additive
		Regression Kernels (BARK) provides an implementation for non-
		parametric function estimation using Levy Random Field priors
		for functions that may be represented as a sum of additive
		multivariate kernels.  Kernels are located at every data point
		as in Support Vector Machines, however, coefficients may be
		heavily shrunk to zero under the Cauchy process prior, or even,
		set to zero.  The number of active features is controlled by
		priors on precision parameters within the kernels, permitting
		feature selection. For more details see Ouyang, Z (2008)
