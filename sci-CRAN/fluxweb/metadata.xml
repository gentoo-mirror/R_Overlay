		Estimate Energy Fluxes in Food Webs // Compute energy fluxes in
		trophic networks, from resources to their consumers, and can be
		applied to systems ranging from simple two-species interactions
		to highly complex food webs. It implements the approach
		described in Gauzens et al. (2017) doi:10.1101/229450 to
		calculate energy fluxes, which are also used to calculate
		equilibrium stability.
