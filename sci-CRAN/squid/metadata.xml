		Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences // A
		simulation-based tool made to help researchers to become
		familiar with multilevel variations, and to build up sampling
		designs for their study. This tool has two main objectives:
		First, it provides an educational tool useful for students,
		teachers and researchers who want to learn to use mixed-effects
		models. Users can experience how the mixed-effects model
		framework can be used to understand distinct biological
		phenomena by interactively exploring simulated multilevel data.
		Second, it offers research opportunities to those who are
		already familiar with mixed-effects models, as it enables the
		generation of data sets that users may download and use for a
		range of simulation-based statistical analyses such as power
		and sensitivity analysis of multilevel and multivariate data
