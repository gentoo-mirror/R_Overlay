		Survival Analysis for AdVerse Events with VarYing Follow-Up Times
		// The SAVVY (Survival Analysis for AdVerse Events with VarYing
		Follow-Up Times) project is a consortium of academic and
		pharmaceutical industry partners that aims to improve the
		analyses of adverse event (AE) data in clinical trials through
		the use of survival techniques appropriately dealing with
		varying follow-up times and competing events, see Stegherr,
		Schmoor, Beyersmann, et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1186/s13063-021-05354-x. Although statistical
		methodologies have advanced, in AE analyses often the incidence
		proportion, the incidence density or a non-parametric Kaplan-
		Meier estimator are used, which either ignore censoring or
		competing events. This package contains functions to easily
		conduct the proposed improved AE analyses.
