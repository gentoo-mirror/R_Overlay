		Size-Power Tradeoff Visualization for Equal Predictive Ability of
		Two Forecasts // Offers a set of tools for visualizing and
		analyzing size and power properties of the test for equal
		predictive accuracy, the Diebold-Mariano test that is based on
		heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation-robust (HAR) inference.
		A typical HAR inference is involved with non-parametric
		estimation of the long-run variance, and one of its tuning
		parameters, the truncation parameter, trades off a size and
		power. Lazarus, Lewis, and Stock (2021)doi:10.3982/ECTA15404
		theoretically characterize the size-power frontier for the
		Gaussian multivariate location model. 'ForeComp' computes and
		visualizes the finite-sample size-power frontier of the
		Diebold-Mariano test based on fixed-b asymptotics together with
		the Bartlett kernel. To compute the finite-sample size and
		power, it works with the best approximating ARMA process to the
		given dataset. It informs the user how their choice of the
		truncation parameter performs and how robust the testing
		outcomes are.
