		Autocorrelation Function for Functional Time Series // Quantify
		the serial correlation across lags of a given functional time
		series using an autocorrelation function for functional time
		series. The autocorrelation function is based on the L2 norm of
		the lagged covariance operators of the series. Functions are
		available for estimating the distribution of the
		autocorrelation function under the assumption of strong
		functional white noise.
