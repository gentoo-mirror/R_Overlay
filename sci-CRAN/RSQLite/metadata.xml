		SQLite Interface for R // Embeds the SQLite database engine in R
		and provides an interface compliant with the DBI package. The
		source for the SQLite engine and for various extensions in a
		recent version is included. System libraries will never be
		consulted because this package relies on static linking for the
		plugins it includes; this also ensures a consistent experience
		across all installations.
