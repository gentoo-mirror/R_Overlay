		Concordance for Dendroclimatology // The concordance method is a
		non-parametric method based on bootstrapping that is used to
		test the hypothesis that two subsets of time series are similar
		in terms of mean, variance or both. This method was developed
		to address a concern within dendroclimatology that young trees
		may produce a differing climate response to older more
		established trees. Details of this method are available in
		Pirie, M. (2013). The Climate of New Zealand reconstructed from
		kauri tree rings: Enhancement through the use of novel
		statistical methodology. PhD. Dissertation, School of
		Environment and Department of Statistics, University of
		Auckland, New Zealand. This package also produces a figure with
		3 panels, each panel is for a different climate variable. An
		example of this figure in included in "On the influence of tree
		size on the climate - growth relationship of New Zealand kauri
		(Agathis australis): insights from annual, monthly and daily
		growth patterns. J Wunder, AM Fowler, ER Cook, M Pirie, SPJ
		McCloskey. Trees 27 (4), 937-948". For further R functions for
		loading your own dendroclimatology datasets and performing
		dendrochronology analysis refer to the R package "dplR:
		Dendrochronology Program Library in R". The concordance
		procedure is intended to add to the standard dendrochronology
		techniques provided in "dplR".
