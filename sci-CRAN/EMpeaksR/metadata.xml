		Conducting the Peak Fitting Based on the EM Algorithm // The peak
		fitting of spectral data is performed by using the frame work
		of EM algorithm. We adapted the EM algorithm for the peak
		fitting of spectral data set by considering the weight of the
		intensity corresponding to the measurement energy steps

		(2019, 2021 and 2023) doi:10.1080/14686996.2019.1620123,

		doi:10.1080/27660400.2022.2159753. The package efficiently
		estimates the parameters of Gaussian mixture model during
		iterative calculation between E-step and M-step, and the
		parameters are converged to a local optimal solution. This
		package can support the investigation of peak shift with two
		advantages: (1) a large amount of data can be processed at high
		speed; and (2) stable and automatic calculation can be easily
		performed.
