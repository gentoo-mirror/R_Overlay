		Marginal Hazard Ratio Estimation in Clustered Failure Time Data
		// Estimation of marginal hazard ratios in clustered failure
		time data. It implements the weighted generalized estimating
		equation approach based on a semiparametric marginal
		proportional hazards model (See Niu, Y. Peng, Y.(2015). "A new
		estimating equation approach for marginal hazard ratio
		estimation"), accounting for within-cluster correlations. 5
		different correlation structures are supported. The package is
		designed for researchers in biostatistics and epidemiology who
		require accurate and efficient estimation methods for survival
		analysis in clustered data settings.
