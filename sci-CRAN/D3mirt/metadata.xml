		Descriptive 3D Multidimensional Item Response Theory Modeling //
		The 'D3mirt' package is used for identifying, estimating, and
		plotting descriptive multidimensional item response theory
		models, restricted to 3D and dichotomous or polytomous data
		that fit the two-parameter logistic model or the graded
		response model. The method is foremost explorative and centered
		around the plot function that exposes item characteristics and
		constructs, represented by vector arrows, located in a three-
		dimensional interactive space. The results can be useful for
		item-level analysis as well as test development.
