		Relevance-Integrated Statistical Inference Engine // A framework
		of methods to perform customized inference at individual level
		by taking contextual covariates into account. Three main
		functions are provided in this package: (i) LASER(): it
		generates specially-designed artificial relevant samples for a
		given case; (ii) g2l.proc(): computes customized fdr(z|x); and
		(iii) rEB.proc(): performs empirical Bayes inference based on
		LASERs. The details can be found in Mukhopadhyay, S., and Wang,
		K (2020, Technical Report).
