		Relevance-Integrated Statistical Inference Engine // Provide
		methods to perform customized inference at individual level by
		taking contextual covariates into account. Three main functions
		are provided in this package: (i) LASER(): it generates
		specially-designed artificial relevant samples for a given
		case; (ii) g2l.proc(): computes customized fdr(z|x); and (iii)
		rEB.proc(): performs empirical Bayes inference based on LASERs.
		The details can be found in Mukhopadhyay, S., and Wang, K
		(2021, arXiv:2004.09588).
