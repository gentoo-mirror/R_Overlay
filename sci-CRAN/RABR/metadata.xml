		Simulations for Response Adaptive Block Randomization Design //
		Conduct simulations of the Response Adaptive Block
		Randomization (RABR) design to evaluate its type I error rate,
		power and operating characteristics for binary and continuous
		endpoints. For more details of the proposed method, please
		refer to Zhan et al. (2020) arXiv:2004.07356.
