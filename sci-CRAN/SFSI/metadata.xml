		Sparse Family and Selection Index // Here we provide tools for
		the estimation of coefficients in penalized regressions when
		the (co)variance matrix of predictors and the covariance vector
		between predictors and response, are provided. These methods
		are extended to the context of a Selection Index (commonly used
		for breeding value prediction). The approaches offer
		opportunities such as the integration of high-throughput traits
		in genetic evaluations ('Lopez-Cruz et al., 2020')
		doi:10.1038/s41598-020-65011-2 and solutions for training set
		optimization in Genomic Prediction ('Lopez-Cruz  de los Campos,
		2021') doi:10.1093/genetics/iyab030.
