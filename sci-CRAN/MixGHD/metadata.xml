		Model Based Clustering, Classification and Discriminant Analysis
		Using the Mixture of Generalized Hyperbolic Distributions //
		Carries out model-based clustering, classification and
		discriminant analysis using five different models. The models
		are all based on the  generalized hyperbolic distribution. The
		first model 'MGHD' (Browne and McNicholas (2015)
		doi:10.1002/cjs.11246) is the classical mixture of generalized
		hyperbolic distributions. The 'MGHFA' (Tortora et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s11634-015-0204-z) is the mixture of generalized
		hyperbolic factor analyzers for high dimensional data sets. The
		'MSGHD' is the mixture of  multiple scaled generalized
		hyperbolic distributions, the 'cMSGHD'  is a 'MSGHD' with
		convex contour plots and the 'MCGHD', mixture of  coalesced
		generalized hyperbolic distributions is a new more flexible
		model (Tortora et al. (2019)doi:10.1007/s00357-019-09319-3. The
		paper related to the software can be found at
		doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i03.
