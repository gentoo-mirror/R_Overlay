		Compute Maps and Properties of Polar Zonoids // In each odd
		dimension is a convex body - the polar zonoid - whose
		generating functions are trigonometric polynomials.  The polar
		zonoid is a straightforward generalization of the polar
		zonohedron in dimension 3, as defined by Chilton and Coxeter
		(1963) doi:10.2307/2313051. The package has some applications
		of the polar zonoid, including the properties of configuration
		spaces of arcs on the circle and 3x3 rotation matrices.  There
		is also a root solver for trigonometric polynomials.
