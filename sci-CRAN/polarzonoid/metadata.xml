		Compute Maps and Properties of Polar Zonoids // In each odd
		dimension is a convex body - the polar zonoid - whose
		generating functions are trigonometric polynomials.  The polar
		zonoid is a straightforward generalization of the polar
		zonohedron in dimension 3. The package has some applications of
		the polar zonoid, including the properties of configuration
		spaces of arcs on the circle and 3x3 rotation matrices.  There
		is also a root solver for trigonometric polynomials.
