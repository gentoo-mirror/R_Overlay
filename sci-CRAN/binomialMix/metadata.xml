		Mixture Models for Binomial and Longitudinal Data // Provides a
		clustering method of non-gaussian longitudinal data with a
		mixture of generalized linear models. The longitudinal data
		should be defined as repeated observations for each individual.
		The number of observations for each individual can be
		different. In runEM(), an expectation-maximization algorithm is
		developed for both binomial and longitudinal data mixture
		model.
