	<longdescription>
		S3 Style Object Oriented Programming // Create simple, hassle-
		free classes with reference semantics similar to 'RefClass' or
		'R6' but relying on S3 methods. "oops" class instances tend to
		be lighter weight and faster to create. Creating a class is as
		easy creating a list, while generating an instance is a simple
		function call. Support for inheritance and fixed field classes.
