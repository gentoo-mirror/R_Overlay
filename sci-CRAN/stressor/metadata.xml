		Algorithms for Testing Models under Stress // Traditional model
		evaluation metrics fail to capture model performance under less
		than ideal conditions. This package employs techniques to
		evaluate models "under-stress". This includes testing models'
		extrapolation ability, or testing accuracy on specific sub-
		samples of the overall model space. Details describing stress-
		testing methods in this package are provided in Haycock (2023)
		doi:10.26076/2am5-9f67. The other primary contribution of this
		package is provided to R users access to the 'Python' library
		'PyCaret' https://pycaret.org/ for quick and easy access to
		auto-tuned machine learning models.
