		Working with Matrices over Finite Prime Fields // Provides
		functions for row-reducing and inverting matrices with entries
		in many of the finite fields (those with a prime number of
		elements). With this package, users will be able to find the
		reduced row echelon form (RREF) of a matrix and calculate the
		inverse of a (square, invertible) matrix.
