		General Bivariate Copula Theory and Many Utility Functions //
		Extensive functions for bivariate copula (bicopula)
		computations and related operations concerning oft cited
		bicopula theory described by Nelsen (2006), Joe (2014), and
		other selected works. The lower, upper, product, and select
		other bicopula are implemented. Arbitrary bicopula expressions
		include the diagonal, survival copula, the dual of a copula,
		co-copula, numerical bicopula density, and maximum likelihood
		estimation. Level curves (sets), horizontal and vertical
		sections also are supported. Numerical derivatives and inverses
		of a bicopula are provided; simulation by the conditional
		distribution method thus is supported. Bicopula composition,
		convex combination, and products are provided. Support extends
		to Kendall Function as well as the Lmoments thereof, Kendall
		Tau, Spearman Rho and Footrule, Gini Gamma, Blomqvist Beta,
		Hoeffding Phi, Schweizer-Wolff Sigma, tail dependency
		(including pseudo-polar representation) and tail order,
		skewness, and bivariate Lmoments. Evaluators of
		positively/negatively quadrant dependency, left increasing and
		right decreasing are available. Kullback-Leibler divergence,
		Vuong's procedure, Spectral Measure, and Lcomoments for copula
		inference are available. Quantile and median regressions for V
		with respect to U and U with respect to V are available.
		Empirical copulas (EC) are supported.
