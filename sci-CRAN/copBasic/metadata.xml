		General Bivariate Copula Theory and Many Utility Functions //
		Extensive functions for bivariate copula (bicopula)
		computations and related operations for bicopula theory. The
		lower, upper, product, and select other bicopula are
		implemented along with operations including the diagonal,
		survival copula, dual of a copula, co-copula, and numerical
		bicopula density. Level sets, horizontal and vertical sections
		are supported. Numerical derivatives and inverses of a bicopula
		are provided through which simulation is implemented. Bicopula
		composition, convex combination, asymmetry extension, and
		products also are provided. Support extends to the Kendall
		Function as well as the Lmoments thereof. Kendall Tau, Spearman
		Rho and Footrule, Gini Gamma, Blomqvist Beta, Hoeffding Phi,
		Schweizer- Wolff Sigma, tail dependency, tail order, skewness,
		and bivariate Lmoments are implemented, and positive/negative
		quadrant dependency, left (right) increasing (decreasing) are
		available. Other features include Kullback-Leibler Divergence,
		Vuong Procedure, spectral measure, and Lcomoments for
		inference, maximum likelihood, and AIC, BIC, and RMSE for
		goodness-of-fit.
