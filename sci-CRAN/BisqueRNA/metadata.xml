		Decomposition of Bulk Expression with Single-Cell Sequencing //
		Provides tools to accurately estimate cell type abundances from
		heterogeneous bulk expression. A reference-based method
		utilizes single-cell information to generate a signature matrix
		and transformation of bulk expression for accurate regression
		based estimates. A marker-based method utilizes known cell-
		specific marker genes to measure relative abundances across
		samples. For more details, see Jew and Alvarez et al (2019)
