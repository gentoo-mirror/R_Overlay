		Handling and Manipulating Remote Sensing Data // Herein, we
		provide a broad variety of functions which are useful for
		handling, manipulating, and visualizing satellite-based remote
		sensing data. These operations range from mere data import and
		layer handling (eg subsetting), over Raster* typical data
		wrangling (eg crop, extend), to more sophisticated
		(pre-)processing tasks typically applied to satellite imagery
		(eg atmospheric and topographic correction). This functionality
		is complemented by a full access to the satellite layers'
		metadata at any stage and the documentation of performed
		actions in a separate log file. Currently available sensors
		include Landsat 4-5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 (OLI/TIRS Combined),
		and additional compatibility is ensured for the Landsat Global
		Land Survey data set.
