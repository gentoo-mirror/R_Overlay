		Tools for Biometry and Applied Statistics in Agricultural Science
		// Tools designed to perform and work with cluster analysis
		(including Tocher's algorithm), discriminant analysis and path
		analysis (standard and under collinearity), as well as some
		useful miscellaneous tools for dealing with sample size and
		optimum plot size calculations. Mantel's permutation test can
		be found in this package. A new approach for calculating its
		power is implemented. biotools also contains the new tests for
		genetic covariance components.
