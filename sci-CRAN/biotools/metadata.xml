		Tools for Biometry and Applied Statistics in Agricultural Science
		// Tools designed to perform and evaluate cluster analysis
		(including Tocher's algorithm), discriminant analysis and path
		analysis (standard and under collinearity), as well as some
		useful miscellaneous tools for dealing with sample size and
		optimum plot size calculations. A test for seed sample
		heterogeneity is now available. Mantel's permutation test can
		be found in this package. A new approach for calculating its
		power is implemented. biotools also contains tests for genetic
		covariance components. Heuristic approaches for performing non-
		parametric spatial predictions of generic response variables
		and spatial gene diversity are implemented.
