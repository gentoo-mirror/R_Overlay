		Litter Analysis // Data sets on various litter types like beach
		litter, riverain litter, floating litter, and seafloor litter
		are rapidly growing. This package offers a simple user
		interface to analyse these litter data in a consistent and
		reproducible way. It also provides functions to facilitate
		several kinds of litter analysis, e.g., trend analysis, power
		analysis, and baseline analysis. Under the hood, these
		functions are also used by the user interface. See Schulz et
		al. (2019) doi:10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.030 for details.
