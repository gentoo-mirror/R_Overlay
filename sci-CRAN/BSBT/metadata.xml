		The Bayesian Spatial Bradley--Terry Model // An implementation of
		the Bayesian Spatial Bradley--Terry (BSBT) model. It can be
		used to investigate data sets where judges compared different
		spatial areas. It constructs a network to describe how the
		areas are connected, and then places a correlated prior
		distribution on the quality parameter for each area, based on
		the network. The package includes MCMC algorithms to estimate
		the quality parameters. The methodology is published in Seymour
		et. al. (2020) arXiv:2010.14128.
