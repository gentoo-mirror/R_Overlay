		Mesh Topology and Visualization for Spatial Data // Gives direct
		access to generic 3D tools and provides a full suite of mesh-
		creation and 3D plotting functions. By extending the 'rgl'
		package conversion and visualization functions for the 'mesh3d'
		class a wide variety of complex spatial data can be brought
		into 3D scenes. These tools allow for spatial raster, polygons,
		and lines that are common in 'GIS' contexts to be converted
		into mesh forms with high flexibility and the ability to
		integrate disparate data types. Vector and raster data can be
		seamlessly combined as meshes, and surfaces can be set to have
		material properties based on data values or with image
		textures. Textures and other data combinations use projection
		transformations to map between coordinate systems, and objects
		can be easily visualized in an interactive scene at any stage.
		This package relies on the 'RTriangle' package for high-quality
		triangular meshing which is licensed restrictively under 'CC
		BY-NC-SA 4.0'.
