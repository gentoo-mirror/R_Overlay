		Visualize Simple 2-D Decision Tree Partitions // Visualize the
		partitions of simple decision trees, involving one or two
		predictors, on the scale of the original data. Provides an
		intuitive alternative to traditional tree diagrams, by
		visualizing how a decision tree divides the predictor space in
		a simple 2D plot alongside the original data. The 'parttree'
		package supports both classification and regression trees from
		'rpart' and 'partykit', as well as trees produced by popular
		frontend systems like 'tidymodels' and 'mlr3'. Visualization
		methods are provided for both base R graphics and 'ggplot2'.
