		Agnostic, Idiomatic Data Filter Module for Shiny // When added to
		an existing shiny app, users may subset any developer-chosen R
		data.frame on the fly. That is, users are empowered to slice
		dice data by applying multiple (order specific) filters using
		the AND () operator between each, and getting real-time updates
		on the number of rows effected/available along the way. Thus,
		any downstream processes that leverage this data source (like
		tables, plots, or statistical procedures) will re-render after
		new filters are applied. The shiny modules user interface has a
		'minimalist' aesthetic so that the focus can be on the data
		other visuals. In addition to returning a reactive (filtered)
		data.frame, 'IDEAFilter' as also returns 'dplyr' filter
		statements used to actually slice the data.
