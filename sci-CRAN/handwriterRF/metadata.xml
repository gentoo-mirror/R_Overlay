		Handwriting Analysis with Random Forests // Perform forensic
		handwriting analysis of two scanned handwritten documents. This
		package implements the statistical method described by Madeline
		Johnson and Danica Ommen (2021) doi:10.1002/sam.11566.
		Similarity measures and a random forest produce a score-based
		likelihood ratio that quantifies the strength of the evidence
		in favor of the documents being written by the same writer or
		different writers.
