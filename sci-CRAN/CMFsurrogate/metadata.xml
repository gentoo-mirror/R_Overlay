		Calibrated Model Fusion Approach to Combine Surrogate Markers //
		Uses a calibrated model fusion approach to optimally combine
		multiple surrogate markers. Specifically, two initial estimates
		of optimal composite scores of the markers are obtained; the
		optimal calibrated combination of the two estimated scores is
		then constructed which ensures both validity of the final
		combined score and optimality with respect to the proportion of
		treatment effect explained (PTE) by the final combined score.
		The primary function, pte.estimate.multiple(), estimates the
		PTE of the identified combination of multiple surrogate
		markers. Details are described in Wang et al (2022)
