		Constrained Estimation of Linear Probability Model // Estimation
		of linear model with predictions inside the (0,1) interval.
		Standard least squares criterion is minimized subjected to a
		penalty term that enforces the constraints. The estimator is
		suitable for binary responses, or any response between 0 and 1.
