		Just Another Latent Space Network Clustering Algorithm // Fit and
		simulate latent space network cluster models using an
		expectation-maximization algorithm. Enables flexible modeling
		of unweighted network data, supporting both directed and
		undirected networks, with or without degree heterogeneity.
		Designed to handle large networks efficiently, it allows users
		to explore network structure through latent space
		representations, identify clusters within network data, and
		simulate models with varying clustering and connectivity
		patterns.
