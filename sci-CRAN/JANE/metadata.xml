		Just Another Latent Space Network Clustering Algorithm // Fit
		latent space network cluster models using an expectation-
		maximization algorithm. Enables flexible modeling of unweighted
		or weighted network data (with or without noise edges),
		supporting both directed and undirected networks (with or
		without degree and strength heterogeneity). Designed to handle
		large networks efficiently, it allows users to explore network
		structure through latent space representations, identify
		clusters (i.e., community detection) within network data, and
		simulate networks with varying clustering, connectivity
		patterns, and noise edges. Methodology for the implementation
		is described in Arakkal and Sewell (2025)
