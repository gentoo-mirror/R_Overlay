		Sparse Wrapper Algorithm // An algorithm that trains a meta-
		learning procedure that combines screening and wrapper methods
		to find a set of extremely low-dimensional attribute
		combinations. This package works on top of the 'caret' package
		and proceeds in a forward-step manner. More specifically, it
		builds and tests learners starting from very few attributes
		until it includes a maximal number of attributes by increasing
		the number of attributes at each step. Hence, for each fixed
		number of attributes, the algorithm tests various (randomly
		selected) learners and picks those with the best performance in
		terms of training error. Throughout, the algorithm uses the
		information coming from the best learners at the previous step
		to build and test learners in the following step. In the end,
		it outputs a set of strong low-dimensional learners.
