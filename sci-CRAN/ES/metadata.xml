		Edge Selection // Implementation of the Edge Selection Algorithm
		for undirected graph selection.  The least angle regression-
		based algorithm selects edges of an undirected graph based on
		the projection of the current residuals on the two dimensional
		edge-planes.  The algorithm selects symmetric adjacency matrix,
		which many other regression-based undirected graph selection
		procedures cannot do.
