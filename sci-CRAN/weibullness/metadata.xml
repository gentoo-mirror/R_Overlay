		Goodness-of-Fit Test for Weibull Distribution (Weibullness) //
		Performs a goodness-of-fit test of Weibull distribution
		(weibullness test) and provides the maximum likelihood
		estimates of the three-parameter Weibull distribution. Note
		that the threshold parameter is estimated based on the
		correlation from the Weibull plot. For more details, see Park
		(2018) doi:10.1155/2018/6056975. This work was supported by the
		National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the
		Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2022R1A2C1091319).
