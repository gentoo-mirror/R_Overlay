		Goodness-of-Fit Test for Weibull Distribution (Weibullness) //
		Conducts a goodness-of-fit test for the Weibull distribution
		(referred to as the weibullness test) and furnishes parameter
		estimations for both the two-parameter and three-parameter
		Weibull distributions. Notably, the threshold parameter is
		derived through correlation from the Weibull plot.
		Additionally, this package conducts goodness-of-fit assessments
		for the exponential, Gumbel, and inverse Weibull distributions,
		accompanied by parameter estimations. For more details, see
