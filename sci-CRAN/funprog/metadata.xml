		Functional Programming // High-order functions for data
		manipulation : sort or group data, given one or more auxiliary
		functions. Functions are inspired by other pure functional
		programming languages ('Haskell' mainly). The package also
		provides built-in function operators for creating compact
		anonymous functions, as well as the possibility to use the
		'purrr' package syntax.
