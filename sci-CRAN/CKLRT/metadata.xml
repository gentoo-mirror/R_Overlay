		Composite Kernel Machine Regression Based on Likelihood Ratio
		Test // Composite Kernel Machine Regression based on Likelihood
		Ratio Test (CKLRT): in this package, we develop a kernel
		machine regression framework to model the overall genetic
		effect of a SNP-set, considering the possible GE interaction.
		Specifically, we use a composite kernel to specify the overall
		genetic effect via a nonparametric function and we model
		additional covariates parametrically within the regression
		framework. The composite kernel is constructed as a weighted
		average of two kernels, one corresponding to the genetic main
		effect and one corresponding to the GE interaction effect. We
		propose a likelihood ratio test (LRT) and a restricted
		likelihood ratio test (RLRT) for statistical significance. We
		derive a Monte Carlo approach for the finite sample
		distributions of LRT and RLRT statistics. (N. Zhao, H. Zhang,
