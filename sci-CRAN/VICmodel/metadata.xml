		The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) Model // The Variable
		Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a macroscale hydrologic
		model that solves full water and energy balances, originally
		developed by Xu Liang at the University of Washington (UW). The
		version of VIC source code used is of 5.0.1 on
		https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC/, see Hamman et al. (2018).
		Development and maintenance of the current official version of
		the VIC model at present is led by the UW Hydro (Computational
		Hydrology group) in the Department of Civil and Environmental
		Engineering at UW. VIC is a research model and in its various
		forms it has been applied to most of the major river basins
		around the world, as well as globally. If you make use of this
		model, please acknowledge the appropriate references listed in
		the help page of this package or on the references page
		http://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/Documentation/References/
		of the VIC official documentation website. These should include

		features you are using Reference: Liang, X., D. P. Lettenmaier,
