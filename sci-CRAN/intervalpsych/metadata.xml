		Analyzing Interval Data in Psychometrics // Implements the
		Interval Consensus Model (ICM) for analyzing continuous bounded
		interval-valued responses in psychometrics using 'Stan' for
		'Bayesian' estimation. Provides functions for transforming
		interval data to simplex representations, fitting item response
		theory (IRT) models with isometric log-ratio (ILR) and sum log-
		ratio (SLR) link functions, and visualizing results. The
		package enables aggregation and analysis of interval-valued
		response data commonly found in psychological measurement and
		related disciplines. Based on Kloft et al. (2024)
