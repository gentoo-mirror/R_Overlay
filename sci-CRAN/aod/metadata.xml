		Analysis of Overdispersed Data // Provides a set of functions to
		analyse overdispersed counts or proportions. Most of the
		methods are already available elsewhere but are scattered in
		different packages. The proposed functions should be considered
		as complements to more sophisticated methods such as
		generalized estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear
		mixed effect models (GLMM).
