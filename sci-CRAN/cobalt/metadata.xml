		Covariate Balance Tables and Plots // Generate balance tables and
		plots for covariates of groups preprocessed through matching,
		weighting or subclassification, for example, using propensity
		scores. Includes integration with 'MatchIt', 'twang',
		'Matching', 'optmatch', 'CBPS', 'ebal', 'WeightIt', 'cem',
		'sbw', and 'designmatch' for assessing balance on the output of
		their preprocessing functions. Users can also specify data for
		balance assessment not generated through the above packages.
		Also included are methods for assessing balance in clustered or
		multiply imputed data sets or data sets with multi-category,
		continuous, or longitudinal treatments.
