		Generates Aoristic Probability Distributions // It can sometimes
		be difficult to ascertain when some events (such as property
		crime) occur because the victim is not present when the crime
		happens. As a result, police databases often record a 'start'
		(or 'from') date and time, and an 'end' (or 'to') date and
		time. The time span between these date/times can be minutes,
		hours, or sometimes days, hence the term 'Aoristic'. Aoristic
		is one of the past tenses in Greek and represents an uncertain
		occurrence in time. For events with a location describes with
		either a latitude/longitude, or X,Y coordinate pair, and a
		start and end date/time, this package generates an aoristic
		data frame with aoristic weighted probability values for each
		hour of the week, for each observation. Outputs include an
		aoristic data frame, as well as summary graphs and displays.
		For more information see: Ratcliffe, JH (2002) Aoristic
		signatures and the temporal analysis of high volume crime
		patterns, Journal of Quantitative Criminology. 18 (1): 23-43.
		Note: This package replaces an original 'aoristic' package
		(version 0.6) by George Kikuchi that has been discontinued with
		his permission.
