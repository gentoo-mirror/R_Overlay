		aoristic analysis with spatial output (kml) // 'Aoristic' is one
		of the past tenses in Greek and represents an uncertain
		occurrence time.  Aoristic analysis suggested by Ratcliffe
		(2002) is a method to analyze events that do not have exact
		times of occurrence but have starting times and ending times.
		For example, a property crime database (e.g., burglary)
		typically has a starting time and ending time of the crime that
		could have occurred.  Aoristic analysis allocates the
		probability of a crime incident occurring at every hour over a
		24-hour period. The probability is aggregated over a study area
		to create an aoristic graph. Using crime incident data with
		lat/lon, DateTimeFrom, and DateTimeTo, functions in this
		package creates a total of three (3) kml files and
		corresponding aoristic graphs: 1) density and contour; 2) grid
		count; and 3) shapefile boundary. (see also:
