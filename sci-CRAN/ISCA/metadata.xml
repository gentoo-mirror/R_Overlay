		Compare Heterogeneous Social Groups // The Inductive Subgroup
		Comparison Approach ('ISCA') offers a way to compare groups
		that are internally differentiated and heterogeneous. It starts
		by identifying the social structure of a reference group
		against which a minority or another group is to be compared,
		yielding empirical subgroups to which minority members are then
		matched based on how similar they are. The modelling of
		specific outcomes then occurs within specific subgroups in
		which majority and minority members are matched. 'ISCA' is
		characterized by its data-driven, probabilistic, and iterative
		approach and combines fuzzy clustering, Monte Carlo simulation,
		and regression analysis. ISCA_random_assignments() assigns
		subjects probabilistically to subgroups. ISCA_clustertable()
		provides summary statistics of each cluster across iterations.
		ISCA_modeling() provides Ordinary Least Squares regression
		results for each cluster across iterations. For further details
		please see Drouhot (2021) doi:10.1086/712804.
