		Bayesian Modeling and Analysis of Spatially Correlated Survival
		Data // Provides several Bayesian survival models for spatial
		/non-spatial survival data: proportional hazards (PH),
		accelerated failure time (AFT), proportional odds (PO), and
		accelerated hazards (AH), a super model that includes PH, AFT,
		PO and AH as special cases, Bayesian nonparametric
		nonproportional hazards (LDDPM), generalized accelerated
		failure time (GAFT), and spatially smoothed Polya tree density
		estimation. The spatial dependence is modeled via frailties
		under PH, AFT, PO, AH and GAFT, and via copulas under LDDPM and
		PH. Model choice is carried out via the logarithm of the pseudo
		marginal likelihood (LPML), the deviance information criterion
		(DIC), and the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC).
