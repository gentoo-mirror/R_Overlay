		Superpixels of Spatial Data // Creates superpixels based on input
		spatial data. This package works on spatial data with one
		variable (e.g., continuous raster), many variables (e.g., RGB
		rasters), and spatial patterns (e.g., areas in categorical
		rasters). It is based on the SLIC algorithm (Achanta et al.
		(2012) doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2012.120), and readapts it to work
		with arbitrary dissimilarity measures.
