		Wavelet Based Error Trend Seasonality Model // ETS stands for
		Error, Trend, and Seasonality, and it is a popular time series
		forecasting method. Wavelet decomposition can be used for
		denoising, compression, and feature extraction of signals. By
		removing the high-frequency components, wavelet decomposition
		can remove noise from the data while preserving important
		features. A hybrid Wavelet ETS  (Error Trend-Seasonality) model
		has been developed for time series forecasting using algorithm
		of Anjoy and Paul (2017) DOI:10.1007/s00521-017-3289-9.
