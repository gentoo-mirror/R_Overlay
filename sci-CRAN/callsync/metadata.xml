		Recording Synchronisation, Call Detection and Assignment, Audio
		Analysis // Intended to analyse recordings from multiple
		microphones (e.g., backpack microphones in captive setting). It
		allows users to align recordings even if there is non-linear
		drift of several minutes between them. A call detection and
		assignment pipeline can be used to find vocalisations and
		assign them to the vocalising individuals (even if the
		vocalisation is picked up on multiple microphones). The tracing
		and measurement functions allow for detailed analysis of the
		vocalisations and filtering of noise. Finally, the package
		includes a function to run spectrographic cross correlation,
		which can be used to compare vocalisations. It also includes
		multiple other functions related to analysis of vocal
		behaviour.
