		Supervised NMF // Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF) is a
		powerful tool for identifying the key features of microbial
		communities and a dimension-reduction method. When we are
		interested in the differences between the structures of two
		groups of communities, supervised NMF(Yun Cai, Hong Gu and
		Tobby Kenney (2017),doi:10.1186/s40168-017-0323-1) provides a
		better way to do this, while retaining all the advantages of
		NMF -- such as interpretability, and being based on a simple
		biological intuition.
