		Permutation Randomization // Provides randomization using
		permutation for applications.  To provide a Quality Control
		(QC) check, QC samples can be randomized within strata.  A
		second function allows for the ability to switch samples to
		meet set requirements and perform a certain amount of
		minimization on these switches.  The functions are flexible for
		users by specifying strata size and number of QC samples per
		strata.  The randomization meets the following requirements  QC
		sample requirements: QC samples not adjacent, QC samples from
		same mother must follow certain patterns.  Matched sample sets
		must be within a single strata, and next to each other.
