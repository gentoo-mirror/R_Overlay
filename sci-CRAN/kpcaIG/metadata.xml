		Variables Interpretability with Kernel PCA // The kernelized
		version of principal component analysis (KPCA) has proven to be
		a valid nonlinear alternative for tackling the nonlinearity of
		biological sample spaces. However, it poses new challenges in
		terms of the interpretability of the original variables.
		'kpcaIG' aims to provide a tool to select the most relevant
		variables based on the kernel PCA representation of the data as
		in Briscik et al. (2023) doi:10.1186/s12859-023-05404-y. It
		also includes functions for 2D and 3D visualization of the
		original variables (as arrows) into the kernel principal
		components axes, highlighting the contribution of the most
		important ones.
