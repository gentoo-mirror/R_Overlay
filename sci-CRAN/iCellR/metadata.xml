		Analyzing High-Throughput Single Cell Sequencing Data // A
		toolkit that allows scientists to work with data from single
		cell sequencing technologies such as scRNA-seq, scVDJ-seq and
		CITE-Seq. Single (i) Cell R package ('iCellR') provides
		unprecedented flexibility at every step of the analysis
		pipeline, including normalization, clustering, dimensionality
		reduction, imputation, visualization, and so on. Users can
		design both unsupervised and supervised models to best suit
		their research. In addition, the toolkit provides 2D and 3D
		interactive visualizations, differential expression analysis,
		filters based on cells, genes and clusters, data merging,
		normalizing for dropouts, data imputation methods, correcting
		for batch differences, pathway analysis, tools to find marker
		genes for clusters and conditions, predict cell types and
		pseudotime analysis. See Khodadadi-Jamayran, et al (2020)
		doi:10.1101/2020.05.05.078550  and Khodadadi-Jamayran, et al
		(2020) doi:10.1101/2020.03.31.019109 for more details.
