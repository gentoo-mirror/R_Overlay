		Pricing of Variable Annuities // Pricing of variable annuity life
		insurance contracts by means of Monte Carlo methods. Monte
		Carlo is used to price the contract in case the policyholder
		cannot surrender while Least Squares Monte Carlo is used if the
		insured can surrender. This package implements the pricing
		framework and algorithm described in Bacinello et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2011.05.003. It also implements the
		state-dependent fee structure discussed in Bernard et al.
		(2014) doi:10.1017/asb.2014.13 as well as a function which
		prices the contract by resolving the partial differential
		equation described in MacKay et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1111/jori.12094.
