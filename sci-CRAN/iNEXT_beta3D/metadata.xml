		Interpolation and Extrapolation with Beta Diversity for Three
		Dimensions of Biodiversity // As a sequel to 'iNEXT', the
		'iNEXT.beta3D' package provides functions to compute
		standardized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity
		(3D) estimates with a common sample size (for alpha and gamma
		diversity) or sample coverage (for alpha, beta, gamma diversity
		as well as dissimilarity or turnover indices). Hill numbers and
		their generalizations are used to quantify 3D and to make
		multiplicative decomposition (gamma = alpha x beta). The
		package also features size- and coverage-based rarefaction and
		extrapolation sampling curves to facilitate rigorous comparison
		of beta diversity across datasets. See Chao et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1002/ecm.1588 for more details.
