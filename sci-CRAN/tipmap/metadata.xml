		Tipping Point Analysis for Bayesian Dynamic Borrowing // Tipping
		point analysis for clinical trials that employ Bayesian dynamic
		borrowing via robust meta-analytic predictive (MAP) priors.
		Mainly an implementation of an approach proposed by Best and
		colleagues (2021) is provided doi:10.1002/pst.2093. Further
		functions facilitate the specification of the robust MAP prior
		via expert elicitation (using the roulette method). Intended
		use is the planning, analysis and interpretation of
		extrapolation studies in pediatric drug development, but
		applicability is generally wider.
