		Tipping Point Analysis for Bayesian Dynamic Borrowing // Tipping
		point analysis for clinical trials that employ Bayesian dynamic
		borrowing via robust meta-analytic predictive (MAP) priors.
		Further functions facilitate expert elicitation of a primary
		weight of the informative component of the robust MAP prior and
		computation of operating characteristics. Intended use is the
		planning, analysis and interpretation of extrapolation studies
		in pediatric drug development, but applicability is generally
		wider.
