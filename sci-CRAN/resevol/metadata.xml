		Simulate Agricultural Production and Evolution of Pesticide
		Resistance // Simulates individual-based models of agricultural
		pest management and the evolution of pesticide resistance.
		Management occurs on a spatially explicit landscape that is
		divided into an arbitrary number of farms that can grow one of
		up to 10 crops and apply one of up to 10 pesticides. Pest
		genomes are modelled in a way that allows for any number of
		pest traits with an arbitrary covariance structure that is
		constructed using an evolutionary algorithm in the
		mine_gmatrix() function. Simulations are then run using the
		run_farm_sim() function. This package thereby allows for highly
		mechanistic social-ecological models of the evolution of
		pesticide resistance under different types of crop rotation and
		pesticide application regimes.
