		Implementation of Augmented Network Log Anomaly Detection
		Procedures // Implements procedures developed by Gutierrez et
		al. (2017, https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-0
		39/index.html) to aid in detecting network log anomalies. By
		combining various multivariate analytic approaches relevant to
		network anomaly detection, it provides cyber analysts efficient
		means to detect suspected anomalies requiring further
		evaluation.
