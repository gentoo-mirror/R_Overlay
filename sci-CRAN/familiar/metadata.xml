		End-to-End Automated Machine Learning and Model Evaluation //
		Single unified interface for end-to-end modelling of
		regression, categorical and time-to-event (survival) outcomes.
		Models created using familiar are self-containing, and their
		use does not require additional information such as baseline
		survival, feature clustering, or feature transformation and
		normalisation parameters. Model performance, calibration, risk
		group stratification, (permutation) variable importance,
		individual conditional expectation, partial dependence, and
		more, are assessed automatically as part of the evaluation
		process and exported in tabular format and plotted, and may
		also be computed manually using export and plot functions.
		Where possible, metrics and values obtained during the
		evaluation process come with confidence intervals.
