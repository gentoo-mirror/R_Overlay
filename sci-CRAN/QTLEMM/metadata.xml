		QTL Mapping and Hotspots Detection // For QTL mapping, it
		consists of several functions to perform various tasks,
		including simulating or analyzing data, computing the
		significance thresholds and visualizing the QTL mapping
		results. The single-QTL or multiple-QTL method that allows a
		host of statistical models to be fitted and compared is applied
		to analyze the data for the estimation of QTL parameters. The
		models include the linear regression, permutation test, normal
		mixture model and truncated normal mixture model. The Gaussian
		stochastic process is implemented to compute the significance
		thresholds for QTL detection onto a genetic linkage map in the
		experimental populations. Two types of data, the complete
		genotyping or selective genotyping data, from various
		experimental populations, including backcross, F2, recombinant
		inbred (RI) populations, advanced intercrossed (AI)
		populations, are considered in the QTL mapping analysis. For
		QTL hotpot detection, the statistical methods can be developed
		based on either using the individual-level data or using the
		summarized data. We have proposed a statistical framework that
		can handle both the individual-level data and summarized QTL
		data for QTL hotspots detection. Our statistical framework can
		overcome the underestimation of threshold arising from ignoring
		the correlation structure among traits, and also identify the
		different types of hotspots with very low computational cost
		during the detection process. Here, we attempt to provide the R
		code for our statistical framework. The QTL mapping program is
		carried out by EM process, which can be seen in Kao, C.-H.

		genotyping can be seen in H.-I LEE, H.-A. HO  and C.-H. Kao
		(2014) doi:10.1534/genetics.114.168385. The analyze of QTL
		hotspot detection can be seen in Wu, P.-Y., M.-.H. Yang, and
		C.-H. Kao (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.08.13.249342.
