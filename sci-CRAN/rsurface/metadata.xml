		Design of Rotatable Central Composite Experiments and Response
		Surface Analysis // Produces tables with the level of
		replication (number of replicates) and the experimental uncoded
		values of the quantitative factors to be used for rotatable
		Central Composite Design (CCD) experimentation and a 2-D
		contour plot of the corresponding variance of the predicted
		response according to Mead et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1017/CBO9781139020879 design_ccd(), and analyzes CCD
		data with response surface methodology ccd_analysis(). A
		rotatable CCD provides values of the variance of the predicted
		response that are concentrically distributed around the average
		treatment combination used in the experimentation, which with
		uniform precision (implied by the use of several replicates at
		the average treatment combination) improves greatly the search
		and finding of an optimum response. These properties of a
		rotatable CCD represent undeniable advantages over the
		classical factorial design, as discussed by Panneton et al.
