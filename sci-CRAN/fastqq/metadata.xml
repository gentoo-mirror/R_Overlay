		Faster Generation of Quantile Quantile Plots with Large Samples
		// New and faster implementations for quantile quantile plots.
		The package also includes a function to prune data for quantile
		quantile plots. This can drastically reduce the running time
		for large samples, for 100 million samples, you can expect a
		factor 80X speedup.
