		Computing Lower Bound of Ljung-Box Test // The Ljung-Box test is
		one of the most important tests for time series diagnostics and
		model selection. The  Hassani SACF (Sum of the Sample
		Autocorrelation Function) Theorem , however, indicates that the
		sum of sample autocorrelation function is always fix for any
		stationary time series with arbitrary length. This package
		confirms for sensitivity of the Ljung-Box test to the number of
		lags involved in the test and therefore it should be used with
		extra caution. The Hassani SACF Theorem has been described in :
		Hassani, Yeganegi and M. R. (2019)
