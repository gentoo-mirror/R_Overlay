		High Performance Remote File System, Database and 'Geospatial'
		Access Using 'duckdb' // Provides friendly wrappers for
		creating 'duckdb'-backed connections to tabular datasets
		('csv', parquet, etc) on local or remote file systems. This
		mimics the behaviour of "open_dataset" in the 'arrow' package,
		but in addition to 'S3' file system also generalizes to any
		list of 'http' URLs.
