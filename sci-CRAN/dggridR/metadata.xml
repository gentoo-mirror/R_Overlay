		Discrete Global Grids // Spatial analyses involving binning
		require that every bin have the same area, but this is
		impossible using a rectangular grid laid over the Earth or over
		any projection of the Earth. Discrete global grids use
		hexagons, triangles, and diamonds to overcome this issue,
		overlaying the Earth with equally-sized bins. This package
		provides utilities for working with discrete global grids,
		along with utilities to aid in plotting such data.
