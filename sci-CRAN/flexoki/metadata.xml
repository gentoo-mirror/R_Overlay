		Inky Color Schemes // Provides color palettes designed to be
		reminiscent of text on paper. The color schemes were taken from
		https://stephango.com/flexoki. Includes discrete, continuous,
		and binned scales that are not necessarily color-blind
		friendly. Simple scale and theme functions are available for
		use with 'ggplot2'.
