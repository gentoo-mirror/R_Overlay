		A Super K-Nearest Neighbor (SKNN) Classification Algorithm //
		It's a Super K-Nearest Neighbor(SKNN) classification method
		with using kernel density to describe weight of the distance
		between a training observation and the testing sample.
		Comparison of performance between SKNN and KNN shows that SKNN
		is significantly superior to KNN.
