		Algorithms for Matching Bullet Lands // Analyze bullet lands
		using nonparametric methods. We provide a reading routine for
		x3p files (see http://www.openfmc.org for more information) and
		a host of analysis functions designed to assess the probability
		that two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel.
