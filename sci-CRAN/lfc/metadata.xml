		Log Fold Change Distribution Tools for Working with Ratios of
		Counts // Ratios of count data such as obtained from RNA-seq
		are modelled using Bayesian statistics to derive posteriors for
		effects sizes. This approach is described in Erhard  Zimmer
		(2015) doi:10.1093/nar/gkv696 and Erhard (2018)
