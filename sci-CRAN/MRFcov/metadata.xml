		Markov Random Fields with Additional Covariates // Approximate
		node interaction parameters of Markov Random Fields graphical
		networks. Models can incorporate additional covariates,
		allowing users to estimate how interactions between nodes in
		the graph are predicted to change across covariate gradients.
		The general methods implemented in this package are described
		in Clark et al. (2018) doi:10.1002/ecy.2221.
