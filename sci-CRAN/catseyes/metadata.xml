		Create Catseye Plots Illustrating the Normal Distribution of the
		Means // Provides the tools to produce catseye plots,
		principally by catseyesplot() function which calls R's standard
		plot() function internally, or alternatively by the catseyes()
		function to overlay the catseye plot onto an existing R plot
		window. Catseye plots illustrate the normal distribution of the
		mean (picture a normal bell curve reflected over its base and
		rotated 90 degrees), with a shaded confidence interval; they
		are an intuitive way of illustrating and comparing normally
		distributed estimates, and are arguably a superior alternative
		to standard confidence intervals, since they show the full
		distribution rather than fixed quantile bounds. The
		catseyesplot and catseyes functions require pre-calculated
		means and standard errors (or standard deviations), provided as
		numeric vectors; this allows the flexibility of obtaining this
		information from a variety of sources, such as direct
		calculation or prediction from a model.  Catseye plots, as
		illustrations of the normal distribution of the means, are
		described in Cumming (2013  2014). Cumming, G. (2013). The new
		statistics: Why and how. Psychological Science, 27, 7-29.
