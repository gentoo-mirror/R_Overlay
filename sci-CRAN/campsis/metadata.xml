		Generic PK/PD Simulation Platform CAMPSIS // A generic, easy-to-
		use and intuitive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)
		simulation platform based on R packages 'rxode2' and
		'mrgsolve'. CAMPSIS provides an abstraction layer over the
		underlying processes of writing a PK/PD model, assembling a
		custom dataset and running a simulation. CAMPSIS has a strong
		dependency to the R package 'campsismod', which allows to
		read/write a model from/to files and adapt it further on the
		fly in the R environment. Package 'campsis' allows the user to
		assemble a dataset in an intuitive manner. Once the users
		dataset is ready, the package is in charge of preparing the
		simulation, calling 'rxode2' or 'mrgsolve' (at the user's
		choice) and returning the results, for the given model, dataset
		and desired simulation settings.
