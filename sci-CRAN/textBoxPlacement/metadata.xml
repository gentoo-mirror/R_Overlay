		Compute a Non-Overlapping Layout of Text Boxes to Label Multiple
		Overlain Plots // Compute a non-overlapping layout of text
		boxes to label multiple overlain curves. For each curve,
		iteratively search for an adjacent x,y position for the text
		box that does not overlap with the other curves. If this
		process fails, then offsets are computed to add to the y values
		for each curve, that results in sufficient space to add all of
		the text labels.
