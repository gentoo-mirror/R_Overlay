		Quadratic Inference Function // Developed to perform the
		estimation and inference for regression coefficient parameters
		in longitudinal marginal models using the method of quadratic
		inference functions. Like generalized estimating equations,
		this method is also a quasi-likelihood inference method. It has
		been showed that the method gives consistent estimators of the
		regression coefficients even if the correlation structure is
		misspecified, and it is more efficient than GEE when the
		correlation structure is misspecified. Based on Qu, A.,
		Lindsay, B.G. and Li, B. (2000) doi:10.1093/biomet/87.4.823.
