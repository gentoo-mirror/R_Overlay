		Market Area Models for Retail and Service Locations // Market
		area models are used to analyze and predict store choices and
		market areas concerning retail and service locations. This
		package is a more user-friendly wrapper of the functions in the
		package 'MCI' (Wieland 2017) providing market area analysis
		using the Huff Model or the Multiplicative Competitive
		Interaction (MCI) Model. In 'MCI2', also a function for
		creating transport costs matrices is provided.
