		An approach to the visualization, analysis, and interpretation
		of (microbial) community composition data, especially those
		originating from amplicon sequencing. Analysis techniques
		include constrained and unconstrained ordination and
		visualizing taxonomic abundances and spatial patterns, among
		others. Methods intended to assist bioinformaticians and
		ecologists in selecting read trimming by quality scores and
		preprocessing/denoising of datasets are also provided.
