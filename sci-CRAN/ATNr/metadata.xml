		Run Allometric Trophic Networks Models // Implements the
		differential equations associated to different versions of
		Allometric Trophic Models (ATN) to estimate the temporal
		dynamics of species biomasses in food webs. It offers several
		features to generate synthetic food webs and to parametrise
		models as well as a wrapper to the ODE solver deSolve.
