		Risk Model Decision Analysis // Provides tools to evaluate the
		value of using a risk prediction instrument to decide treatment
		or intervention (versus no treatment or intervention).  Given
		one or more risk prediction instruments (risk models) that
		estimate the probability of a binary outcome, rmda provides
		functions to estimate and display decision curves and other
		figures that help assess the population impact of using a risk
		model for clinical decision making.   Here, "population" refers
		to the relevant patient population. Decision curves display
		estimates of the (standardized) net benefit over a range of
		probability thresholds used to categorize observations as 'high
		risk'. The curves help evaluate a treatment policy that
		recommends treatment for patients who are estimated to be 'high
		risk' by comparing the population impact of a risk-based policy
		to "treat all" and "treat none" intervention policies.  Curves
		can be estimated using data from a prospective cohort.  In
		addition, rmda can estimate decision curves using data from a
		case-control study if an estimate of the population outcome
		prevalence is available.  Version 1.4 of the package provides
		an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations
		where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might
		be used to recommend that low-risk patients (i.e., patients
		below some risk threshold) opt out of treatment. Confidence
		intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be computed and
		displayed. A wrapper function to calculate cross-validated
		curves using k-fold cross-validation is also provided.
