		Tidy Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects // Estimates
		heterogeneous treatment effects using tidy semantics on
		experimental or observational data.  Methods are based on the
		doubly-robust learner of Kennedy (2023) doi:10.1214/23-EJS2157.
		You provide a simple recipe for what machine learning
		algorithms to use in estimating the nuisance functions and
		'tidyhte' will take care of cross-validation, estimation, model
		selection, diagnostics and construction of relevant quantities
		of interest about the variability of treatment effects.
