		Propensity Clustering and Decomposition // This package
		implements propensity clustering and decomposition. Propensity
		decomposition can be viewed on the one hand as a generalization
		of the eigenvector-based approximation of correlation networks,
		and on the other hand as a generalization of random multigraph
		models and conformity-based decompositions.
