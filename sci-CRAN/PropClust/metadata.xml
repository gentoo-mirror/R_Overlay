		Propensity Clustering and Decomposition // Implementation of
		propensity clustering and decomposition as described in Ranola
		et al. (2013) doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-21. Propensity
		decomposition can be viewed on the one hand as a generalization
		of the eigenvector-based approximation of correlation networks,
		and on the other hand as a generalization of random multigraph
		models and conformity-based decompositions.
