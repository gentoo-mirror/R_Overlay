		Aggregate Numeric, Date and Categorical Variables // Convenience
		functions for aggregating a data frame or data table. Currently
		mean, sum and variance are supported. For Date variables, the
		recency and duration are supported. There is also support for
		dummy variables in predictive contexts. Code has been
		completely re-written in data.table for computational speed.
