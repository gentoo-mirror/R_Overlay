		Single Cell Genomics for Enhancing Cell Composition Inference
		from Bulk Genomics Data // Cellular population mapping (CPM) a
		deconvolution algorithm in which single-cell genomics is
		required in only one or a few samples, where in other samples
		of the same tissue, only bulk genomics is measured and the
		underlying fine resolution cellular heterogeneity is inferred.
