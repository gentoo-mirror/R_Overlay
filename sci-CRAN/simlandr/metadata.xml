		Simulation-Based Landscape Construction for Dynamical Systems //
		A toolbox for constructing potential landscapes for dynamical
		systems using Monte Carlo simulation.  The method is based on
		the potential landscape definition by Wang et al. (2008)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.0800579105 (also see Zhou  Li, 2016
		doi:10.1063/1.4943096 for further mathematical discussions) and
		can be used for a large variety of models.
