		Locally Induced Gaussian Process Regression // Performs locally
		induced approximate GP regression for large computer
		experiments and spatial datasets following Cole D.A.,
		Christianson, R., Gramacy, R.B. (2021) Statistics and
		Computing, 31(3), 1-21, arXiv:2008.12857. The approximation is
		based on small local designs combined with a set of inducing
		points (latent design points) for predictions at particular
		inputs. Parallelization is supported for generating predictions
		over an immense out-of-sample testing set. Local optimization
		of the inducing points design is provided based on variance-
		based criteria. Inducing point template schemes, including
		scaling of space-filling designs, are also provided.
