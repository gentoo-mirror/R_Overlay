		Measuring Agreement Using Sklar's Omega Coefficient // Provides
		tools for applying Sklar's Omega (Hughes, 2018)
		arXiv:1803.02734 methodology to nominal, ordinal, interval, or
		ratio scores. The framework can accommodate any number of
		units, any number of coders, and missingness; and can be used
		to measure agreement with a gold standard, intra-coder
		agreement, and/or inter-coder agreement. Frequentist inference
		is supported for all levels of measurement. Bayesian inference
		is supported for interval and ratio scores.
