		Measuring Agreement Using Sklar's Omega Coefficient // Provides
		tools for applying Sklar's Omega (Hughes, 2018)
		arXiv:1803.02734 methodology to nominal scores, ordinal scores,
		percentages, counts, amounts (i.e., non-negative real numbers),
		and balances (i.e., any real number). The framework can
		accommodate any number of units, any number of coders, and
		missingness; and can be used to measure agreement with a gold
		standard, intra-coder agreement, and/or inter-coder agreement.
		Frequentist inference is supported for all levels of
		measurement. Bayesian inference is supported for continuous
		scores only.
