		Modeling Species Distributions in Three Dimensions // Facilitates
		modeling species' ecological niches and geographic
		distributions based on occurrences and environments that have a
		vertical as well as horizontal component, and projecting models
		into three-dimensional geographic space. Working in three
		dimensions is useful in an aquatic context when the organisms
		one wishes to model can be found across a wide range of depths
		in the water column. The package also contains functions to
		automatically generate marine training model training regions
		using machine learning, and interpolate and smooth patchily
		sampled environmental rasters using thin plate splines. Davis
