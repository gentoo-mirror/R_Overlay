		Stock-Flow-Consistent Model Simulator // Define, simulate, and
		validate stock-flow consistent (SFC) macroeconomic models. The
		godley R package offers tools to dynamically define model
		structures by adding variables and specifying governing systems
		of equations. With it, users can analyze how different
		macroeconomic structures affect key variables, perform
		parameter sensitivity analyses, introduce policy shocks, and
		visualize resulting economic scenarios. The accounting
		structure of SFC models follows the approach outlined in the
		seminal study by Godley and Lavoie (2007,
		ISBN:978-1-137-08599-3), ensuring a comprehensive integration
		of all economic flows and stocks. The algorithms implemented to
		solve the models are based on methodologies from Kinsella and
		O'Shea (2010) doi:10.2139/ssrn.1729205, Peressini and Sullivan
		(1988, ISBN:0-387-96614-5), and contributions by Joao Macalos.
