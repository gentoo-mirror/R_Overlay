		Automated Fitting of Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis Through
		the 'Mplus' Program // Automated generation, running, and
		interpretation of moderated nonlinear factor analysis models
		for obtaining scores from observed variables. This package
		creates 'Mplus' input files which may be run iteratively to
		test two different types of covariate effects on items: (1)
		latent variable impact (both mean and variance); and (2)
		differential item functioning. After sequentially testing for
		all effects, it also creates a final model by including all
		significant effects after adjusting for multiple comparisons.
		Finally, the package creates a scoring model which uses the
		final values of parameter estimates to generate latent variable
		scores.
