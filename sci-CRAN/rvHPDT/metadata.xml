		Calling Haplotype-Based and Variant-Based Pedigree Disequilibrium
		Test for Rare Variants in Pedigrees // To detecting rare
		variants for binary traits using general pedigrees, the
		pedigree disequilibrium tests are proposed by collapsing rare
		haplotypes/variants with/without weights. To run the test,
		MERLIN is needed in Linux for haplotyping.
