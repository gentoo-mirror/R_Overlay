		Seamless R and C++ Integration // The 'Rcpp' package provides R
		functions as well as C++ classes which offer a seamless
		integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects can be
		mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both
		writing of new code as well as easier integration of third-
		party libraries. Documentation about 'Rcpp' is provided by
		several vignettes included in this package, via the 'Rcpp
		Gallery' site at https://gallery.rcpp.org, the paper by
		Eddelbuettel and Francois (2011, doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i08),
		the book by Eddelbuettel (2013, doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6868-4)
		and the paper by Eddelbuettel and Balamuta (2018,
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375990); see 'citation("Rcpp")' for
		details.
