		Estimation of the Generalised Beta Distribution of the Second
		Kind from Grouped Data // Estimation of the generalized beta
		distribution of the second kind (GB2) and related models using
		grouped data in form of income shares. The GB2 family is a
		general class of distributions that provides an accurate fit to
		income data. 'GB2group' includes functions to estimate the GB2,
		the Singh-Maddala, the Dagum, the Beta 2, the Lognormal and the
		Fisk distributions. 'GB2group' deploys two different
		econometric strategies to estimate these parametric
		distributions, the equally weighted minimum distance (EWMD)
		estimator and the optimally weighted minimum distance (OMD)
		estimator. Asymptotic standard errors are reported for the OMD
		estimates. Standard errors of the EWMD estimates are obtained
		by Monte Carlo simulation. See Jorda et al. (2018)
		arXiv:1808.09831 for a detailed description of the estimation
		procedure.
