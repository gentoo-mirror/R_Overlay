		Index Numbers in Social Sciences // We provide an R tool to
		determine index numbers. It is a measure of the evolution of a
		fixed magnitude for only a product of for several products. It
		is very useful in Social Sciences. Among others, we obtain
		simple index numbers (in chain or in serie), index numbers for
		not only a product or weighted index numbers as the Laspeyres
		index (Laspeyres, 1864), the Paasche index (Paasche, 1874) or
		the Fisher index (Lapedes, 1978).
