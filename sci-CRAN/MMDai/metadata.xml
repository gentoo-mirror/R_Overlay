		Multivariate Multinomial Distribution Approximation and
		Imputation for Incomplete Data // Missingness in categorical
		data is a common problem in various real applications.
		Traditional approaches either utilize only the complete
		observations or impute the missing data by some ad hoc methods
		rather than the true conditional distribution of the missing
		data, thus losing or distorting the rich information in the
		partial observations. This package develops a Bayesian
		nonparametric approach, the Dirichlet Process Mixture of
		Collapsed Product-Multinomials (DPMCPM, Wang et al. (2017)
		arXiv:1712.02214v1), to model the full data jointly and compute
		the model efficiently. By fitting an infinite mixture of
		product-multinomial distributions, DPMCPM is applicable for any
		categorical data regardless of the true distribution, which may
		contain complex association among variables. Under the
		framework of latent class analysis, we show that DPMCPM can
		model general missing mechanisms by creating an extra category
		to denote missingness, which implicitly integrates out the
		missing part with regard to their true conditional
		distribution.
