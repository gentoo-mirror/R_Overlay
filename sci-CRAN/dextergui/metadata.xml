		A Graphic User Interface to Dexter // Shiny Dexter provides a
		graphic user interface to most of the main functionality in
		dexter. Its main purpose is to make the first steps in R for
		the practising psychometrician much easier but it can be used
		as a standalone tool for the main psychometric tasks of a
		typical educational testing institute such as Data management,
		Classical test analysis and IRT.
