		Reference Interval Estimation using Real-World Data // Indirect
		method for the estimation of reference intervals using Real-
		World Data ('RWD'). It takes routine measurements of diagnostic
		tests, containing pathological and non-pathological samples as
		input and uses sophisticated statistical methods to derive a
		model describing the distribution of the non-pathological
		samples. This distribution can then be used to derive reference
		intervals. Furthermore, the package offers functions for
		printing and plotting the results of the algorithm. The method
		is described in detail in Ammer T., Schuetzenmeister A.,
		Prokosch H.-U., Rauh M., Rank C.M., Zierk J. "refineR: A Novel
		Algorithm for Reference Interval Estimation from Real-World
		Data". Scientific Reports (2021) [accepted July 21, 2021].
