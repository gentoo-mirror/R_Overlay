		The Merging Path Plot // The Merging Path Plot is a methodology
		for adaptive fusing of k-groups with likelihood-based model
		selection. This package contains tools for exploration and
		visualization of k-group dissimilarities. Comparison of
		k-groups is one of the most important issues in exploratory
		analyses and it has zillions of applications. The traditional
		approach is to use pairwise post hoc tests in order to verify
		which groups differ significantly. However, this approach fails
		with a large number of groups in both interpretation and
		visualization layer. The Merging Path Plot solves this problem
		by using an easy-to-understand description of dissimilarity
		among groups based on Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) statistic.
		Work on this package was financially supported by the 'NCN Opus
		grant 2016/21/B/ST6/02176'.
