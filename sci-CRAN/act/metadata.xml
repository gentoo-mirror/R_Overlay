		Aligned Corpus Toolkit // The Aligned Corpus Toolkit (act) is
		designed for linguists that work with time aligned
		transcription data. It offers advanced search possibilities in
		transcriptions (full text search, normalized search,
		concordance etc.), functions to modify the data, import-export
		functionality for 'Praat' '*.TextGrid' files, export for 'ELAN'
		'*.eaf' files, the creation of batch lists for cutting audio
		and video files with 'FFmpeg', the creation of printable
		transcripts in the style of conversation analysis, and
		interaction with 'Praat' using 'Praat'-scripts. The package is
		itself written in R and may be expanded by other users.
