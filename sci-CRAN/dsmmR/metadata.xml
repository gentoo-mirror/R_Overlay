		Estimation and Simulation of Drifting Semi-Markov Models //
		Performs parametric and non-parametric estimation and
		simulation of drifting semi-Markov processes. The definition of
		parametric and non-parametric model specifications is also
		possible. Furthermore, three different types of drifting semi-
		Markov models are considered. These models differ in the number
		of transition matrices and sojourn time distributions used for
		the computation of a number of semi-Markov kernels, which in
		turn characterize the drifting semi-Markov kernel. For the
		parametric model estimation and specification, several discrete
		distributions are considered for the sojourn times: Uniform,
		Poisson, Geometric, Discrete Weibull and Negative Binomial. The
		non-parametric model specification makes no assumptions about
		the shape of the sojourn time distributions. Semi-Markov models
		are described in: Barbu, V.S., Limnios, N. (2008)
		doi:10.1007/978-0-387-73173-5. Drifting Markov models are
		described in: Vergne, N. (2008) doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1326.
		Reliability indicators of Drifting Markov models are described
		in: Barbu, V. S., Vergne, N. (2019)
		doi:10.1007/s11009-018-9682-8.
