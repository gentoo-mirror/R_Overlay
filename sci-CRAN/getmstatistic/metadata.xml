		Quantifying Systematic Heterogeneity in Meta-Analysis //
		Quantifying systematic heterogeneity in meta-analysis using R.
		The \code{M} statistic aggregates heterogeneity information
		across multiple variants to, identify systematic heterogeneity
		patterns and their direction of effect in meta-analysis. It's
		primary use is to identify outlier studies, which either show
		"null" effects or consistently show stronger or weaker genetic
		effects than average across, the panel of variants examined in
		a GWAS meta-analysis. In contrast to conventional heterogeneity
		metrics (Q-statistic, I-squared and tau-squared) which measure
		random heterogeneity at individual variants, \code{M} measures
		systematic (non-random) heterogeneity across multiple
		independently associated variants. Systematic heterogeneity can
		arise in a meta-analysis due to differences in the study
		characteristics of participating studies. Some of the
		differences may include: ancestry, allele frequencies,
		phenotype definition, age-of-disease onset, family-history,
		gender, linkage disequilibrium and quality control thresholds.
		See https://magosil86.github.io/getmstatistic/ for statistical
		statistical theory, documentation and examples.
