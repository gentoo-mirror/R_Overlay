		Utilities for Parsing and Plotting Activities // This contains
		helpful functions for parsing, managing, plotting, and
		visualizing activities, most often from GPX (GPS Exchange
		Format) files recorded by GPS devices. It allows easy parsing
		of the source files into standard R data formats, along with
		functions to compute derived data for the activity, and to plot
		the activity in a variety of ways.
