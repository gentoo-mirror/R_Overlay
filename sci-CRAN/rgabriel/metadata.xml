		Gabriel Multiple Comparison Test and Plot the Confidence Interval
		on Barplot // Analyze multi-level one-way experimental designs
		where there are unequal sample sizes and population variance
		homogeneity can not be assumed. To conduct the Gabriel test
		doi:10.2307/2286265, create two vectors: one for your
		observations and one for the factor level of each observation.
		The function, rgabriel, conduct the test and save the output as
