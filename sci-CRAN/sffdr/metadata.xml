		Surrogate Functional False Discovery Rates for Genome-Wide
		Association Studies // Pleiotropy-informed significance
		analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with
		surrogate functional false discovery rates (sfFDR). The sfFDR
		framework adapts the fFDR to leverage informative data from
		multiple sets of GWAS summary statistics to increase power in
		study while accommodating for linkage disequilibrium. sfFDR
		provides estimates of key FDR quantities in a significance
		analysis such as the functional local FDR and q-value, and uses
		these estimates to derive a functional p-value for type I error
		rate control and a functional local Bayes' factor for post-GWAS
		analyses (e.g., fine mapping and colocalization). The sfFDR
		framework is described in Bass and Wallace (2024)
