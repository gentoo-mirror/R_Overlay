		Generalized Correlations and Initial Causal Path // Since causal
		paths from data are important for all sciences, the package
		provides sophisticated functions. The idea is simply that if X
		causes Y (path: X to Y) then non-deterministic variation in X
		is more "original or independent" than similar variation in Y.
		We compare two flipped kernel regressions: X=f(Y, Z) and
		Y=g(X,Z), where Z are control variables. Our first two criteria
		compare absolute cross products of regressor values and
		residuals (Cr1) and absolute residuals (Cr2), are both
		quantified by stochastic dominance of four orders (SD1 to SD4).
		Our third criterion (Cr3) expects X to be better able to
		predict Y than the other way around using generalized partial
		correlation If |r*(x|y)| |r*(y|x)| it suggests that y is more
		likely the "kernel cause" of x. The usual partial correlations
		are generalized with a new non-symmetric matrix developed here.
		Partial correlations help asses effect of x on y after removing
		the effect of a set of variables. The package provides
		additional tools for causal assessment, for printing the causal
		directions in a clear, comprehensive compact summary form, for
		matrix algebra, for "outlier detection", and for numerical
		integration by the trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance, etc.
		The package has functions for bootstrap-based statistical
		inference and one for a heuristic t-test.
