		Generalized Correlations, Causal Paths and Portfolio Selection //
		Since causal paths from data are important for all sciences,
		the package provides many sophisticated functions.
		causeSummBlk() and causeSum2Blk() give easy-to-interpret causal
		paths.  Let Z denote control variables and compare two flipped
		kernel regressions: X=f(Y, Z)+e1 and Y=g(X,Z)+e2. Our criterion
		Cr1 says that if |e1*Y||e2*X| then variation in X is more
		"exogenous or independent" than in Y and causal path is X to Y.
		Criterion Cr2 requires |e2||e1|. These inequalities between
		many absolute values are quantified by four orders of
		stochastic dominance. Our third criterion Cr3 for the causal
		path X to Y requires new generalized partial correlations to
		satisfy |r*(x|y,z)| |r*(y|x,z)|. The function parcorVec()
		reports generalized partials between the first variable and all
		others.  The package provides several R functions including
		get0outliers() for outlier detection, bigfp() for numerical
		integration by the trapezoidal rule, stochdom2() for stochastic
		dominance, pillar3D() for 3D charts, canonRho() for generalized
		canonical correlations, depMeas() measures nonlinear
		dependence, and causeSummary(mtx) reports summary of causal
		paths among matrix columns is easiest to use. Portfolio
		selection: decileVote(), momentVote(), dif4mtx(), exactSdMtx()
		can rank several stocks.  Several functions whose names begin
		with 'boot' provide bootstrap statistical inference including a
		new bootGcRsq() test for "Granger-causality" allowing nonlinear
		relations. A new tool for evaluation of out-of-sample portfolio
		performance is outOFsamp(). Panel data implementation is now
		included. See six vignettes of the package for theory and usage
		tips. See Vinod (2019) \doi{10.1080/03610918.2015.1122048}.
