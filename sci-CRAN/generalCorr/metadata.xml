		Generalized Correlations and Plausible Causal Paths // Since
		causal paths from data are important for all sciences, the
		package provides many sophisticated functions. causeSummary()
		gives easy-to-interpret causal paths.  Let Z denote control
		variables and compare two flipped kernel regressions: X=f(Y,
		Z)+e1 and Y=g(X,Z)+e2. Our criterion Cr1 says that if
		|e1*Y||e2*X| then variation in X is more "exogenous or
		independent" than in Y and causal path is X to Y. Criterion Cr2
		requires |e2||e1|. These inequalities between many absolute
		value are quantified by four orders of stochastic dominance.
		Our third criterion Cr3 for the causal path X to Y requires new
		generalized partial correlations to satisfy |r*(x|y,z)|
		|r*(y|x,z)|. The function parcorMany() reports generalized
		partials between the first variable and all others.  The
		package provides additional R tools for causal assessment,
		"outlier detection," and for numerical integration by the
		trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance, pillar 3D charts, etc.
		We also provide functions for bootstrap-based statistical
		inference for causal paths.
