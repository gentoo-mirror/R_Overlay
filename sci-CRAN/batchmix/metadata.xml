		Semi-Supervised Bayesian Mixture Models Incorporating Batch
		Correction // Semi-supervised and unsupervised Bayesian mixture
		models that simultaneously infer the cluster/class structure
		and a batch correction. Densities available are the
		multivariate normal and the multivariate t. The model sampler
		is implemented in C++. This package is aimed at analysis of
		low-dimensional data generated across several batches. See
		Coleman et al. (2022) doi:10.1101/2022.01.14.476352 for details
		of the model.
