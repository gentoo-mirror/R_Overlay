		Comprehensive Tools for Panel Data Analysis - 'tvtools' //
		Longitudinal data offers insights into population changes over
		time but often requires a flexible structure, especially with
		varying follow-up intervals. Panel data is one way to store
		such records, though it adds complexity to analysis. The
		'tvtools' package for R simplifies exploring and analyzing
		panel data.
