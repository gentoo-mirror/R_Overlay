		Helper Functions for Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression //
		Provides a suite of helper functions to support Bayesian Kernel
		Machine Regression (BKMR) analyses in environmental health
		research. It enables the simulation of realistic multivariate
		exposure data using Multivariate Skewed Gamma distributions,
		estimation of distributional parameters by subgroup, and
		application of adaptive, data-driven thresholds for feature
		selection via Posterior Inclusion Probabilities (PIPs). It is
		especially suited for handling skewed exposure data and
		enhancing the interpretability of BKMR results through
		principled variable selection. The methodology is shown in
		Hasan et. al. (2025) doi:10.1101/2025.04.14.25325822.
