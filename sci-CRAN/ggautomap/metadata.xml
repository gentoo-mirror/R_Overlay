		Create Maps from a Column of Place Names // Mapping tools that
		convert place names to coordinates on the fly. These 'ggplot2'
		extensions make maps from a data frame where one of the columns
		contains place names, without having to directly work with the
		underlying geospatial data and tools. The corresponding map
		data must be registered with 'cartographer' either by the user
		or by another package.
