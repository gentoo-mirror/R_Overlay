		Calibrated Ratio Estimator under Double Sampling Design //
		Population ratio estimator (calibrated) under two-phase random
		sampling design has gained enormous popularity in the recent
		time. This package provides functions for estimation population
		ratio (calibrated) under two phase sampling design, including
		the approximate variance of the ratio estimator. The improved
		ratio estimator can be applicable for both the case, when
		auxiliary data is available at unit level or aggregate level
		(eg., mean or total) for first phase sampled. Calibration
		weight of each unit of the second phase sample was calculated.
		Single and combined inclusion probabilities were also estimated
		for both phases under two phase random [simple random sampling
		without replacement (SRSWOR)] sampling. The improved ratio
		estimator's percentage coefficient of variation was also
		determined as a measure of accuracy. This package has been
		developed based on the theoretical development of Islam et al.
