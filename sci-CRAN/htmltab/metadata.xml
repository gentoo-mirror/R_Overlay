		Assemble Data Frames from HTML Tables // HTML tables are a
		valuable data source but extracting and recasting these data
		into a useful format can be tedious. This package allows to
		collect structured information from HTML tables. It is similar
		to `readHTMLTable()` of the XML package but provides three
		major advantages. First, the function automatically expands row
		and column spans in the header and body cells. Second, users
		are given more control over the identification of header and
		body rows which will end up in the R table, including semantic
		header information that appear throughout the body. Third, the
		function preprocesses table code, corrects common types of
		malformations, removes unneeded parts and so helps to alleviate
		the need for tedious post-processing.
