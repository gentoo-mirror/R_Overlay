		Applying Partitioning Around Medoids to Single Cell Data with
		High Number of Cells // PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids)
		algorithm application to samples of single cell sequencing
		techniques with a high number of cells (as many as the computer
		memory allows). The package uses a binary format to store
		matrices (either full, sparse or symmetric) in files written in
		the disk that can contain any data type (not just double) which
		allows its manipulation when memory is sufficient to load them
		as int or float, but not as double. The PAM implementation is
		done in parallel, using several/all the cores of the machine,
		if it has them. This package shares a great part of its code
		with packages 'jmatrix' and 'parallelpam' but their
		functionality is included here so there is no need to install
		them.
