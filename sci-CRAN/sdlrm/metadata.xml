		Modified Skew Discrete Laplace Regression for Integer-Valued and
		Paired Discrete Data // Implementation of the modified skew
		discrete Laplace (SDL) regression model. The package provides a
		set of functions for a complete analysis of integer-valued
		data, where the dependent variable is assumed to follow a
		modified SDL distribution. This regression model is useful for
		the analysis of integer-valued data and experimental studies in
		which paired discrete observations are collected.
