		Calculate Alkire-Foster Multidimensional Poverty Measures //
		Estimate Multidimensional Poverty Indices disaggregated by
		population subgroups based on the Alkire and Foster method
		(2011) doi:10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.11.006. This includes the
		calculation of standard errors and confidence intervals. Other
		partial indices such as incidence, intensity and indicator-
		specific measures as well as intertemporal changes analysis can
		also be estimated. The standard errors and confidence intervals
		are calculated considering the complex survey design.
