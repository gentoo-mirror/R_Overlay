		Informative Nonparametric Bootstrap Test with Pooled Resampling
		// Sample sizes are often small due to hard to reach target
		populations, rare target events, time constraints, limited
		budgets, or ethical considerations. Two statistical methods
		with promising performance in small samples are the
		nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling method,
		which is the focus of Dwivedi, Mallawaarachchi, and Alvarado
		(2017) doi:10.1002/sim.7263, and informative hypothesis
		testing, which is implemented in the 'restriktor' package. The
		'npboottprmFBar' package uses the nonparametric bootstrap test
		with pooled resampling method to implement informative
		hypothesis testing. The bootFbar() function can be used to
		analyze data with this method and the persimon() function can
		be used to conduct performance simulations on type-one error
		and statistical power.
