		Improves the Interpretation of the Standardized Precipitation
		Index Under Changing Climate Conditions // Improves the
		interpretation of the Standardized Precipitation Index under
		changing climate conditions. The package uses the nonstationary
		approach proposed in Blain et al. (2022) doi:10.1002/joc.7550
		to detect trends in rainfall quantities and to quantify the
		effect of such trends on the probability of a drought event
		occurring.
