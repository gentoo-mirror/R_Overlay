		Convert ICD-10 Codes to CCSR Codes // Provides a tool for
		matching ICD-10 codes to corresponding Clinical Classification
		Software Refined (CCSR) codes. The main function, CCSRfind(),
		identifies each CCSR code that applies to an individual given
		their diagnosis codes. It also provides a summary of CCSR codes
		that are matched to a dataset. The package contains 3 datasets:
		'DXCCSR' (mapping of ICD-10 codes to CCSR codes), 'Legend'
		(conversion of DXCCSR to CCSRfind-usable format for CCSR codes
		with less than or equal to 1000 ICD-10 diagnosis codes), and
		'LegendExtend' (conversion of DXCCSR to CCSRfind-usable format
		for CCSR codes with more than 1000 ICD-10 dx codes). The disc()
		function applies grepl() ('base') to multiple columns and is
		used in CCSRfind().
