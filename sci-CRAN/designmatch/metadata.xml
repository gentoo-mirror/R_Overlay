		Matched Samples that are Balanced and Representative by Design //
		Includes functions for the construction of matched samples that
		are balanced and representative by design.  Among others, these
		functions can be used for matching in observational studies
		with treated and control units, with cases and controls, in
		related settings with instrumental variables, and in
		discontinuity designs.  Also, they can be used for the design
		of randomized experiments, for example, for matching before
		randomization.  By default, 'designmatch' uses the 'GLPK'
		optimization solver, but its performance is greatly enhanced by
		the 'Gurobi' optimization solver and its associated R
		interface.  For their installation, please follow the
		instructions at
		https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html and https:
		//www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.0/refman/r_api_overview.html.
		We have also included directions in the gurobi_installation
		file in the inst folder.
