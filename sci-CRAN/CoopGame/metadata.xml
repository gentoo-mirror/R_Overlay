		Important Concepts of Cooperative Game Theory // The theory of
		cooperative games with transferable utility offers useful
		insights into the way parties can share gains from cooperation
		and secure sustainable agreements, see e.g. one of the books by
		Chakravarty, Mitra and Sarkar (2015, ISBN:978-1107058798) or by
		Driessen (1988, ISBN:978-9027727299) for more details. A
		comprehensive set of tools for cooperative game theory with
		transferable utility is provided. Users can create special
		families of cooperative games, like e.g. bankruptcy games, cost
		sharing games and weighted voting games. There are functions to
		check various game properties and to compute five different
		set-valued solution concepts for cooperative games. A large
		number of point-valued solution concepts is available
		reflecting the diverse application areas of cooperative game
		theory. Some of these point-valued solution concepts can be
		used to analyze weighted voting games and measure the influence
		of individual voters within a voting body. There are routines
		for visualizing both set-valued and point-valued solutions in
		the case of three or four players.
