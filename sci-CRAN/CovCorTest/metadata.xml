		Statistical Tests for Covariance and Correlation Matrices and
		their Structures // A compilation of tests for hypotheses
		regarding covariance and correlation matrices for one or more
		groups. The hypothesis can be specified through a corresponding
		hypothesis matrix and a vector or by choosing one of the basic
		hypotheses, while for the structure test, only the latter
		works. Thereby Monte-Carlo and Bootstrap-techniques are used,
		and the respective method must be chosen, and the functions
		provide p-values and mostly also estimators of calculated
		covariance matrices of test statistics. For more details on the
		methodology, see Sattler et al. (2022)
