		Random Fields on Metric Graphs // Facilitates creation and
		manipulation of metric graphs, such as street or river
		networks. Further facilitates operations and visualizations of
		data on metric graphs, and the creation of a large class of
		random fields and stochastic partial differential equations on
		such spaces. These random fields can be used for simulation,
		prediction and inference. In particular, linear mixed effects
		models including random field components can be fitted to data
		based on computationally efficient sparse matrix
		representations. Interfaces to the R packages 'INLA' and
		'inlabru' are also provided, which facilitate working with
		Bayesian statistical models on metric graphs. The main
		references for the methods are Bolin, Simas and Wallin (2024)
