		Geographical Detectors for Assessing Spatial Factors //
		Geographical detectors for measuring spatial stratified
		heterogeneity, as described in Jinfeng Wang (2010)
		doi:10.1080/13658810802443457 and Jinfeng Wang (2016)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052. Includes the optimal
		discretization of continuous data, four primary functions of
		geographical detectors, comparison of size effects of spatial
		unit and the visualizations of results. To use the package and
		to refer the descriptions of the package, methods and case
		datasets, please cite Yongze Song (2020)
		doi:10.1080/15481603.2020.1760434. The model has been applied
		in factor exploration of road performance and multi-scale
		spatial segmentation for network data, as described in Yongze
		Song (2018) doi:10.3390/rs10111696 and Yongze Song (2020)
		doi:10.1109/TITS.2020.3001193, respectively.
