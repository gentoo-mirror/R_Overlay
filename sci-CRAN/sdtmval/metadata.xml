		Validate SDTM Domains // Provides a set of tools to assist
		statistical programmers in validating Study Data Tabulation
		Model (SDTM) domain data sets. Statistical programmers are
		required to validate that a SDTM data set domain has been
		programmed correctly, per the SDTM Implementation Guide
		(SDTMIG) by 'CDISC'
		(https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig), study
		specification, and study protocol using a process called double
		programming. Double programming involves two different
		programmers independently converting the raw electronic data
		cut (EDC) data into a SDTM domain data table and comparing
		their results to ensure accurate standardization of the data.
		One of these attempts is termed 'production' and the other
		'validation'. Generally, production runs are the official
		programs for submittals and these are written in 'SAS'.
		Validation runs can be programmed in another language, in this
		case 'R'.
