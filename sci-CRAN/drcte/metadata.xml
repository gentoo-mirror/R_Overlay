		Statistical Approaches for Time-to-Event Data in Agriculture // A
		specific and comprehensive framework for the analyses of time-
		to-event data in agriculture. Fit non-parametric and parametric
		time-to-event models. Compare time-to-event curves for
		different experimental groups. Plots and other displays. It is
		particularly tailored to the analyses of data from germination
		and emergence assays. The methods are described in Onofri et
		al. (2022) "A unified framework for the analysis of
		germination, emergence, and other time-to-event data in weed
		science", Weed Science, 70, 259-271 doi:10.1017/wsc.2022.8.
