		Planing, Monitoring and Evaluating Oncological Phase 2 Studies //
		Purpose of this package is it to plan, monitor and evaluate
		oncological phase II studies. In general this kind of studies
		are single-arm trials with planned interim analysis and binary
		endpoint. To meet the resulting requirements, the package
		provides functions to calculate and evaluate 'Simon's two-stage
		designs' and 'so-called' 'subset designs'. If you are
		unfamiliar with this package a good starting point is to take a
		closer look at the functions getSolutions() and
		getSolutionsSub1().The web-based tool
		(https://imbi.shinyapps.io/phaseII-app/) extends the
		functionality of our R package by means of a proper dealing
		with over- and underrunning. The R function binom.test of the
		'stats' R package and the package 'binom' might be helpful to
		assess the performance of the corresponding one-stage design as
		a reference.
