		Discrimination Mitigation for Machine Learning Models // Based on
		different statistical definitions of discrimination, several
		methods have been proposed to detect and mitigate social
		inequality in machine learning models. This package aims to
		provide an alternative to fairness treatment in predictive
		models. The ROC method implemented in this package is described
		by Kamiran, Karim and Zhang (2012)
