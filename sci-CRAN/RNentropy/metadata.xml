		Entropy Based Method for the Detection of Significant Variation
		in Gene Expression Data // An implementation of a method based
		on information theory devised for the identification of genes
		showing a significant variation of expression across multiple
		conditions. Given expression estimates from any number of RNA-
		Seq samples and conditions it identifies genes or transcripts
		with a significant variation of expression across all the
		conditions studied, together with the samples in which they are
		over- or under-expressed. Zambelli et al. (2018)
