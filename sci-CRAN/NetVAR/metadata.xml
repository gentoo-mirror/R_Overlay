		Network Structures in VAR Models // Vector AutoRegressive (VAR)
		type models with tailored regularisation structures are
		provided to uncover network type structures in the data, such
		as influential time series (influencers). Currently the package
		implements the LISAR model from Zhang and Trimborn (2023)
		doi:10.2139/ssrn.4619531. The package automatically derives the
		required regularisation sequences and refines it during the
		estimation to provide the optimal model. The package allows for
		model optimisation under various loss functions such as Mean
		Squared Forecasting Error (MSFE), Akaike Information Criterion
		(AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). It provides a
		dedicated class, allowing for summary prints of the optimal
		model and a plotting function to conveniently analyse the
		optimal model via heatmaps.
