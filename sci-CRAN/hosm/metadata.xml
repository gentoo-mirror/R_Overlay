		High Order Spatial Matrix // Automatically displays the order and
		spatial weighting matrix of the distance between locations.
		This concept was derived from the research of Mubarak,
		Aslanargun, and Siklar (2021) doi:10.52403/ijrr.20211150 and
		Mubarak, Aslanargun, and Siklar (2022)
		doi:10.17654/0972361722052. Distance data between locations can
		be imported from 'Ms. Excel', 'maps' package or created in 'R'
		programming directly. This package also provides 5 simulations
		of distances between locations derived from fictitious data,
		the 'maps' package, and from research by Mubarak, Aslanargun,
		and Siklar (2022) doi:10.29244/ijsa.v6i1p90-100.
