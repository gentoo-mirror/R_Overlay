		Efficient Computations of Standard Clustering Comparison Measures
		// Implements an efficient O(n) algorithm based on bucket-
		sorting for fast computation of standard clustering comparison
		measures. Available measures include adjusted Rand index (ARI),
		normalized information distance (NID), normalized mutual
		information (NMI), adjusted mutual information (AMI),
		normalized variation information (NVI) and entropy, as
		described in Vinh et al (2009) doi:10.1145/1553374.1553511.
		Include AMI (Adjusted Mutual Information) since version 0.1.2,
		a modified version of ARI (MARI) and simple Chi-square distance
		since version 1.0.0.
