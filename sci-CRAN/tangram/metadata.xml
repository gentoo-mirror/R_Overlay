		The Grammar of Tables // Provides an extensible formula system to
		quickly and easily create production quality tables. The steps
		of the process are formula parser, statistical content
		generation from data, to rendering. Each step of the process is
		separate and user definable thus creating a set of building
		blocks for highly extensible table generation. A user is not
		limited by any of the choices of the package creator other than
		the formula grammar. For example, one could chose to add a
		different S3 rendering function and output a format not
		provided in the default package. Or possibly one would rather
		have Gini coefficients for their statistical content. Routines
		to achieve New England Journal of Medicine style, Lancet style
		and Hmisc::summaryM() statistics are provided. The package
		contains rendering for HTML5, Rmarkdown and an indexing format
		for use in tracing and tracking are provided.
