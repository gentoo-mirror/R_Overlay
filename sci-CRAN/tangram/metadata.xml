		The Grammar of Tables // Provides an extensible formula system to
		quickly and easily create production quality tables. The
		processing steps are a formula parser, statistical content
		generation from data as defined by formula, followed by
		rendering into a table. Each step of the processing is separate
		and user definable thus creating a set of composable building
		blocks for highly customizable table generation. A user is not
		limited by any of the choices of the package creator other than
		the formula grammar. For example, one could chose to add a
		different S3 rendering function and output a format not
		provided in the default package, or possibly one would rather
		have Gini coefficients for their statistical content in a
		resulting table. Routines to achieve New England Journal of
		Medicine style, Lancet style and Hmisc::summaryM() statistics
		are provided. The package contains rendering for HTML5,
		Rmarkdown and an indexing format for use in tracing and
		tracking are provided.
