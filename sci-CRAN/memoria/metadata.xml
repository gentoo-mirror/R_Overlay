		Quantifying Ecological Memory in Palaeoecological Datasets and
		Other Long Time-Series // Tools to quantify ecological memory
		in long time-series with Random Forest models (Breiman 2001
		doi:10.1023/A:1010933404324) fitted with the 'ranger' library
		(Wright and Ziegler 2017 doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01).
		Particularly oriented to palaeoecological datasets and
		simulated pollen curves produced by the 'virtualPollen'
		package, but also applicable to other long time-series
		involving a set of environmental drivers and a biotic response.
