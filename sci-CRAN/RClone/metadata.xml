		Partially Clonal Populations Analysis // R version of 'GenClone'
		(a computer program to analyse genotypic data, test for
		clonality and describe spatial clonal organization, Arnaud-
		Haond  Belkhir 2007, https://wwz.ifremer.fr/clonix/content/down
		load/68205/903914/file/GenClone2.0.setup.zip), this package
		allows clone handling as 'GenClone' does, plus the possibility
		to work with several populations, MultiLocus Lineages (MLL)
		custom definition and use, and p-value calculation for psex
		statistic (probability of originating from distinct sexual
		events) and psex_Fis statistic (taking account of Hardy-
		Weinberg equilibrium departure) as 'MLGsim'/'MLGsim2' (a
		program for detecting clones using a simulation approach,
		Stenberg et al. 2003).
