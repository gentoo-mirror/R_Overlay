		Finding the Number of Significant Principal Components //
		Implements methods to automate the Auer-Gervini graphical
		Bayesian approach for determining the number of significant
		principal components. Automation uses clustering, change
		points, or simple statistical models to distinguish "long" from
		"short" steps in a graph showing the posterior number of
		components as a function of a prior parameter.
