		Simulation of Various Risk Processes // A (not yet exhaustive)
		collection of common models of risk processes in actuarial
		science, represented as formal S4 classes. Each class (risk
		model) has a simulator of its path, and a plotting function.
		Further, a Monte-Carlo estimator of a ruin probability for a
		finite time is implemented, using a parallel computation.
		Currently, the package extends two classical risk models
		Cramer-Lundberg and Sparre Andersen models by including capital
		injections, that are positive jumps (see Breuer L. and Badescu
		A.L. (2014) doi:10.1080/03461238.2011.636969). The intent of
		the package is to provide a user-friendly interface for ruin
		processes' simulators, as well as a solid and extensible
		structure for future extensions.
