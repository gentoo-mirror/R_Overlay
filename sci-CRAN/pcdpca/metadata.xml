		Dynamic Principal Components for Periodically Correlated
		Functional Time Series // Method extends multivariate and
		functional dynamic principal components to periodically
		correlated multivariate time series. This package allows you to
		compute true dynamic principal components in the presence of
		periodicity. We follow implementation guidelines as described
		in Kidzinski, Kokoszka and Jouzdani (2017), in Principal
		component analysis of periodically correlated functional time
		series arXiv:1612.00040.
