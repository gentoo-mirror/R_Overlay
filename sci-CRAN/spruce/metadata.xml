		Spatial Random Effects Clustering of Single Cell Data // Allows
		for identification of cell sub-populations within tissue
		samples using Bayesian multivariate mixture models with spatial
		random effects to account for a wide range of spatial gene
		expression patterns, as described in Allen et. al, 2021
		doi:10.1101/2021.06.23.449615. Bayesian inference is conducted
		using efficient Gibbs sampling implemented using 'Rcpp'.
