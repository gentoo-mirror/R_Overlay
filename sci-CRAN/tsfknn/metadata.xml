		Time Series Forecasting Using Nearest Neighbors // Allows to
		forecast time series using nearest neighbors regression
		Francisco Martinez, Maria P. Frias, Maria D. Perez-Godoy and
		Antonio J. Rivera (2019) doi:10.1007/s10462-017-9593-z. When
		the forecasting horizon is higher than 1, two multi-step ahead
		forecasting strategies can be used. The model built is
		autoregressive, that is, it is only based on the observations
		of the time series. The nearest neighbors used in a prediction
		can be consulted and plotted.
