		Cryptographic Hash, Extendable-Output and Base64 Functions //
		Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64
		encoding and decoding. Performs direct hashing of strings and
		raw vectors. Stream hashes files potentially larger than
		memory, as well as in-memory objects through R's serialization
		mechanism. Implementations include the SHA-256, SHA-3 and
		'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-
		output function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function.
