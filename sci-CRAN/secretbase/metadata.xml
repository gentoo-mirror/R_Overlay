		Cryptographic Hash and Extendable-Output Functions // Fast and
		memory-efficient streaming hash functions. Performs direct
		hashing of strings, raw bytes, and files potentially larger
		than memory, as well as hashing in-memory objects through R's
		serialization mechanism, without requiring allocation of the
		serialized object. Implementations include the SHA-256 and
		SHA-3 cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output
		function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function. The SHA-3
		Secure Hash Standard was published by the National Institute of
		Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015 at
		doi:10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202. The SHA-256 Secure Hash Standard was
		published by NIST in 2002 at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications
		/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf.
