		Cryptographic Hash, Extendable-Output and Base64 Functions //
		Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64
		encoding / decoding. Hashes strings and raw vectors directly.
		Stream hashes files which can be larger than memory, as well as
		in-memory objects through R's serialization mechanism.
		Implementations include the SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak'
		cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output
		function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function.
