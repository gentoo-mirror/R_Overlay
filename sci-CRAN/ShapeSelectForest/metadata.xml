		Shape Selection for Landsat Time Series of Forest Dynamics //
		Landsat satellites collect important data about global forest
		conditions. Documentation about Landsat's role in forest
		disturbance estimation is available at the site
		https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/. By constrained quadratic
		B-splines, this package delivers an optimal shape-restricted
		trajectory to a time series of Landsat imagery for the purpose
		of modeling annual forest disturbance dynamics to behave in an
		ecologically sensible manner assuming one of seven possible
		"shapes", namely, flat, decreasing, one-jump (decreasing, jump
		up, decreasing), inverted vee (increasing then decreasing), vee
		(decreasing then increasing), linear increasing, and double-
		jump (decreasing, jump up, decreasing, jump up, decreasing).
		The main routine selects the best shape according to the
		minimum Bayes information criterion (BIC) or the cone
		information criterion (CIC), which is defined as the log of the
		estimated predictive squared error. The package also provides
		parameters summarizing the temporal pattern including year(s)
		of inflection, magnitude of change, pre- and post-inflection
		rates of growth or recovery. In addition, it contains routines
		for converting a flat map of disturbance agents to time-series
		disturbance maps and a graphical routine displaying the fitted
		trajectory of Landsat imagery.
