		Intensive Care Unit Data with R // Focused on (but not exclusive
		to) data sets hosted on PhysioNet (https://physionet.org),
		'ricu' provides utilities for download, setup and access of
		intensive care unit (ICU) data sets. In addition to functions
		for running arbitrary queries against available data sets, a
		system for defining clinical concepts and encoding their
		representations in tabular ICU data is presented.
