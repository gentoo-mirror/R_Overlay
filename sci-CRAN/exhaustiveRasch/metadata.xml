		Item Selection and Exhaustive Search for Rasch Models //
		Automation of the item selection processes for Rasch scales by
		means of exhaustive search for suitable Rasch models
		(dichotomous, partial credit, rating-scale) in a list of item-
		combinations. The item-combinations to test can be either all
		possible combinations or item-combinations can be defined by
		several rules (forced inclusion of specific items, exclusion of
		combinations, minimum/maximum items of a subset of items).
		Tests for model fit and item fit include ordering of the
		thresholds, item fit-indices, likelihood ratio test, Martin-Lf
		test, Wald-like test, person-item distribution, person
		separation index, principal components of Rasch residuals,
		empirical representation of all raw scores or Rasch trees for
		detecting differential item functioning. The tests, their
		ordering and their parameters can be defined by the user. For
		parameter estimation and model tests, functions of the packages
		'eRm', 'psychotools' or 'pairwise' can be used.
