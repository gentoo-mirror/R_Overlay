		Estimates Reliability of Individual Supervised Learning
		Predictions // An implementation of reliability estimation
		methods described in the paper (Bosnic, Z.,  Kononenko, I.
		(2008) doi:10.1007/s10489-007-0084-9), which allows you to test
		the reliability of a single predicted instance made by your
		model and prediction function. It also allows you to make a
		correlation test to estimate which reliability estimate is the
		most accurate for your model.
