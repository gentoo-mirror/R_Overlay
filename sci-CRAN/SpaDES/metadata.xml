		Develop and Run Spatially Explicit Discrete Event Simulation
		Models // Metapackage for implementing a variety of event-based
		models, with a focus on spatially explicit models. These
		include raster-based, event-based, and agent-based models. The
		core simulation components (provided by 'SpaDES.core') are
		built upon a discrete event simulation (DES; see Matloff (2011)
		ch 7.8.3 https://nostarch.com/artofr.htm) framework that
		facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to include
		additional functionality by running user-built simulation
		modules (see also 'SpaDES.tools'). Included are numerous tools
		to visualize rasters and other maps (via 'quickPlot'), and
		caching methods for reproducible simulations (via
		'reproducible'). Tools for running simulation experiments are
		provided by 'SpaDES.experiment'. Additional functionality is
		provided by the 'SpaDES.addins' and 'SpaDES.shiny' packages.
