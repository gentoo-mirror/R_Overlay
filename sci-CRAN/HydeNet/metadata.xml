		Hybrid Bayesian Networks Using R and JAGS // Facilities for easy
		implementation of hybrid Bayesian networks using R. Bayesian
		networks are directed acyclic graphs representing joint
		probability distributions, where each node represents a random
		variable and each edge represents conditionality. The full
		joint distribution is therefore factorized as a product of
		conditional densities, where each node is assumed to be
		independent of its non-descendents given information on its
		parent nodes. Since exact, closed-form algorithms are
		computationally burdensome for inference within hybrid networks
		that contain a combination of continuous and discrete nodes,
		particle-based approximation techniques like Markov Chain Monte
		Carlo are popular. We provide a user-friendly interface to
		constructing these networks and running inference using the
		'rjags' package. Econometric analyses (maximum expected utility
		under competing policies, value of information) involving
		decision and utility nodes are also supported.
