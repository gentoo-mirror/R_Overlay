		Ordination Methods for the Analysis of Beta-Diversity Indices //
		The analysis of different aspects of biodiversity requires
		specific algorithms. For example, in regionalisation analyses,
		the high frequency of ties and zero values in dissimilarity
		matrices produced by Beta-diversity turnover produces
		hierarchical cluster dendrograms whose topology and bootstrap
		supports are affected by the order of rows in the original
		matrix. Moreover, visualisation of biogeographical
		regionalisation can be facilitated by a combination of
		hierarchical clustering and multi-dimensional scaling. The
		recluster package provides robust techniques to visualise and
		analyse pattern of biodiversity and to improve occurrence data
		for cryptic taxa. Other functions       related to recluster
		(e.g. the biodecrypt family) are currently available in GitHub
		at https://github.com/leondap/recluster.
