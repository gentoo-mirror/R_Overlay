		Moment Condition Based Estimation of Linear Dynamic Panel Data
		Models // Linear dynamic panel data modeling based on linear
		and nonlinear moment conditions as proposed by Holtz-Eakin,
		Newey, and Rosen (1988) doi:10.2307/1913103, Ahn and Schmidt
		(1995) doi:10.1016/0304-4076(94)01641-C, and Arellano and Bover
		(1995) doi:10.1016/0304-4076(94)01642-D. Estimation of the
		model parameters relies on the Generalized Method of Moments
		(GMM), numerical optimization (when nonlinear moment conditions
		are employed) and the computation of closed form solutions
		(when estimation is based on linear moment conditions). One-
		step, two-step and iterated estimation is available. of closed
		form solutions. For inference and specification testing,
		Windmeijer (2005) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.005 and doubly
		corrected standard errors (Hwang, Kang, Lee, 2021
		doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.010) are available. Additionally,
		serial correlation tests, tests for overidentification, and
		Wald tests are provided. Functions for visualizing panel data
		structures and modeling results obtained from GMM estimation
		are also available. The plot methods include functions to plot
		unbalanced panel structure, coefficient ranges and coefficient
		paths across GMM iterations (the latter is implemented
		according to the plot shown in Hansen and Lee, 2021
		doi:10.3982/ECTA16274).
