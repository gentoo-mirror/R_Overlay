		AI Powered Neural Network Solutions for Regression Tasks // It
		offers a sophisticated and versatile tool for creating and
		evaluating artificial intelligence based neural network models
		tailored for regression analysis on datasets with continuous
		target variables. Leveraging the power of neural networks, it
		allows users to experiment with various hidden neuron
		configurations across two layers, optimizing model performance
		through "5 fold"" or "10 fold"" cross validation. The package
		normalizes input data to ensure efficient training and assesses
		model accuracy using key metrics such as R squared (R2), Root
		Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and
		Percentage Error (PER). By storing and visualizing the best
		performing models, it provides a comprehensive solution for
		precise and efficient regression modeling making it an
		invaluable tool for data scientists and researchers aiming to
		harness AI for predictive analytics.
