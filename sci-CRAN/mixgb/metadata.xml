		Multiple Imputation Through 'XGBoost' // Multiple imputation
		using 'XGBoost', subsampling, and predictive mean matching as
		described in Deng and Lumley (2023) arXiv:2106.01574. Our
		method utilizes the capabilities of XGBoost, a highly efficient
		implementation of gradient boosted trees, to capture
		interactions and non-linear relations automatically. Moreover,
		we have integrated subsampling and predictive mean matching to
		minimize bias and reflect appropriate imputation variability.
		This package supports various types of variables and offers
		flexible settings for subsampling and predictive mean matching.
		Additionally, it includes diagnostic tools for evaluating the
		quality of the imputed values.
