		Compare Real Valued Random Variables // A framework with tools to
		compare two random variables, and determine which of takes
		produces lower values. See the README.md at
		https://github.com/EtorArza/RVCompare for a quick start guide.
		It can compute the Cp and Cd of two probability distributions,
		as explained in E. Arza (2021)
		https://github.com/EtorArza/RVCompare-paper/releases. Given the
		observed samples of two random variables X_A and X_B, it can
		compute the cumulative difference-plot (see E. Arza (2021)
		https://github.com/EtorArza/RVCompare-paper/releases for
		details). Uses bootstrap and DKW-bounds to compute the
		confidence bands of the cumulative distributions. These two
		methods are described in B. Efron. (1979)
		doi:10.1214/aos/1176344552 and P. Massart (1990)
		doi:10.1214/aop/1176990746.
