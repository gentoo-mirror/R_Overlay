		Compare Real Valued Random Variables // A framework with tools to
		compare two random variables, and determine which of them
		produces lower values. It can compute the Cp and Cd of
		theoretical of probability distributions, as explained in E.
		Arza (2021) https://github.com/EtorArza/RVCompare-
		paper/releases. Given the observed samples of two random
		variables X_A and X_B, it can compute the confidence bands of
		the cumulative distributions of X'_A and X'_B (see E. Arza
		(2021) https://github.com/EtorArza/RVCompare-paper for details)
		based on the observed samples of X_A and X_B. Uses bootstrap
		and DKW-bounds to compute the confidence bands of the
		cumulative distributions. These two methods are described in B.
