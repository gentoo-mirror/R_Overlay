		Construct Flexible Urban Delineations // Enables the construction
		of flexible urban delineations that can be tailored to specific
		applications or research questions, see Van Migerode et al.
		(2024) DOI:10.1177/23998083241262545 and Van Migerode et al.
		(2025) DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15173220. Originally developed to
		flexibly reconstruct the Degree of Urbanisation classification
		of cities, towns and rural areas developed by Dijkstra et al.
		(2021) DOI:10.1016/j.jue.2020.103312. Now it also support a
		broader range of delineation approaches, using multiple
		datasets  including population, built-up area, and night-time
		light grids  and different thresholding methods.
