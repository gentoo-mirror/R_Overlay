		Nonlinear Time Series Analysis // Simulation, estimation,
		prediction procedure, and model identification methods for
		nonlinear time series analysis, including threshold
		autoregressive models, Markov-switching models, convolutional
		functional autoregressive models, nonlinearity tests, Kalman
		filters and various sequential Monte Carlo methods. More
		examples and details about this package can be found in the
		book "Nonlinear Time Series Analysis" by Ruey S. Tsay and Rong
		Chen, John Wiley  Sons, 2018 (ISBN: 978-1-119-26407-1).
