		Pandemic Prediction Model in an SIRS Framework // A suite of
		methods to fit and predict case count data using a
		compartmental SIRS (Susceptible  Infectious  Recovered
		Susceptible) model, based on an assumed specification of the
		effective reproduction number. The significance of this
		approach is that it relates epidemic progression to the average
		number of contacts of infected individuals, which decays as a
		function of the total susceptible fraction remaining in the
		population. The main functions are pred.curve(), which computes
		the epidemic curve for a set of parameters, and estimate.mle(),
		which finds the best fitting curve to observed data. The
		easiest way to pass arguments to the functions is via a config
		file, which contains input settings required for prediction,
		and the package offers two methods, navigate_to_config()  which
		points the user to the configuration file, and re_predict() for
		starting the fit-predict process. Razvan G. Romanescu et al.
