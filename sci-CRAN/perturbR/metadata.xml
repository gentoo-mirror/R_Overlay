		Random Perturbation of Count Matrices // The perturbR() function
		incrementally perturbs network edges and compares the resulting
		community detection solutions from the rewired networks with
		the solution found for the original network. These comparisons
		aid in understanding the stability of the original solution.
		The package requires symmetric, weighted (specifically, count)
		matrices/networks.
