		Entropy Based Analysis and Tests for Time Series // Implements an
		Entropy measure of dependence based on the Bhattacharya-
		Hellinger-Matusita distance. Can be used as a (nonlinear)
		autocorrelation/crosscorrelation function for continuous and
		categorical time series. The package includes tests for serial
		and cross dependence and nonlinearity based on it. Some
		routines have a parallel version that can be used in a
		multicore/cluster environment. The package makes use of S4
		classes.
