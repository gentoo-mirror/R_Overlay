		Test for Finiteness of Moments in a Distribution // The purpose
		of this package is to tests whether a given moment of the
		distribution of a given sample is finite or not. For heavy-
		tailed distributions with tail exponent b, only moments of
		order smaller than b are finite. Tail exponent and heavy-
		tailedness are notoriously difficult to ascertain. But the
		finiteness of moments (including fractional moments) can be
		tested directly. This package does that following the test
		suggested by Trapani (2016) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.08.006.
