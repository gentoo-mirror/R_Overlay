		Weighted Estimation in Cox Regression // Implements weighted
		estimation in Cox regression as proposed by Schemper, Wakounig
		and Heinze (Statistics in Medicine, 2009, doi:10.1002/sim.3623)
		and as described in Dunkler, Ploner, Schemper and Heinze
		(Journal of Statistical Software, 2018,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v084.i02). Weighted Cox regression provides
		unbiased average hazard ratio estimates also in case of non-
		proportional hazards. Approximated generalized concordance
		probability an effect size measure for clear-cut decisions can
		be obtained. The package provides options to estimate time-
		dependent effects conveniently by including interactions of
		covariates with arbitrary functions of time, with or without
		making use of the weighting option.
