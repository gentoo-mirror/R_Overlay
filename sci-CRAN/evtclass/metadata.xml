		Extreme Value Theory for Open Set Classification - GPD and GEV
		Classifiers // Two classifiers for open set recognition and
		novelty detection based on extreme value theory. The first
		classifier is based on the generalized Pareto distribution
		(GPD) and the second classifier is based on the generalized
		extreme value (GEV) distribution. For details, see Vignotto,
		E.,  Engelke, S. (2018) arXiv:1808.09902.
