		Sensitivity Analysis of Neural Networks // Analysis functions to
		quantify inputs importance in neural network models. Functions
		are available for calculating and plotting the inputs
		importance and obtaining the activation function of each neuron
		layer and its derivatives. The importance of a given input is
		defined as the distribution of the derivatives of the output
		with respect to that input in each training data point
