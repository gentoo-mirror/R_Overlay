		Structural Equation Multidimensional Scaling // Fits a structural
		equation multidimensional scaling (SEMDS) model for asymmetric
		and three-way input dissimilarities. It assumes that the
		dissimilarities are measured with errors. The latent
		dissimilarities are estimated as factor scores within an SEM
		framework while the objects are represented in a low-
		dimensional space as in MDS.
