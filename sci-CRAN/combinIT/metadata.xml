		A Combined Intercation Test for Unreplicated Two-Way Tables //
		There are several non-functional-form-based interaction tests
		for testing interaction in unreplicated two-way layouts.
		However, no single test can detect all patterns of possible
		interaction and the tests are sensitive to a particular pattern
		of interaction. This package combines six non-functional-form-
		based interaction tests for testing additivity. These six tests
		were proposed by Boik (1993) doi:10.1080/02664769300000004,
		Piepho (1994) doi:10.1111/j.1467-842X.1994.tb00889.x, Kharrati-
		Kopaei and Sadooghi-Alvandi (2007)
		doi:10.1080/03610920701386851, Franck et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.05.002, Malik et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1080/03610918.2013.870196 and Kharrati-Kopaei and Miller
		(2016) doi:10.1080/00949655.2015.1057821. The p-values of these
		six tests are combined by Bonferroni, Sidak, Jacobi polynomial
		expansion, and the Gaussian copula methods to provide
		researchers with a testing approach which leverages many
		existing methods to detect disparate forms of non-additivity.
		This package is based on the following published paper:
		Shenavari and Kharrati-Kopaei (2018) doi:10.1111/insr.12262 "A
		Method for Testing Additivity in Unreplicated Two-Way Layouts
		Based on Combining Multiple Interaction Tests". In addition,
		several sentences in help files or descriptions were copied
		from that paper.
