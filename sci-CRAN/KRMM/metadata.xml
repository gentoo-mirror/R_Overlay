		Kernel Ridge Mixed Model // Solves kernel ridge regression,
		within the the mixed model framework, for the linear,
		polynomial, Gaussian, Laplacian and ANOVA kernels. The model
		components (i.e. fixed and random effects) and variance
		parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization
		(EM) algorithm. All the estimated components and parameters,
		e.g. BLUP of dual variables and BLUP of random predictor
		effects for the linear kernel (also known as RR-BLUP), are
		available. The kernel ridge mixed model (KRMM) is described in
		Jacquin L, Cao T-V and Ahmadi N (2016) A Unified and
		Comprehensible View of Parametric and Kernel Methods for
		Genomic Prediction with Application to Rice. Front. Genet.
