		Average Positive Predictive Values (AP) for Binary Outcomes and
		Censored Event Times // We provide tools to estimate two
		prediction accuracy metrics, the average positive predictive
		values (AP) as well as the well-known AUC (the area under the
		receiver operator characteristic curve) for risk scores. The
		outcome of interest is either binary or censored event time.
		Note that for censored event time, our functions' estimates,
		the AP and the AUC, are time-dependent for pre-specified time
		interval(s). A function that compares the APs of two risk
		scores/markers is also included. Optional outputs include
		positive predictive values and true positive fractions at the
		specified marker cut-off values, and a plot of the time-
		dependent AP versus time (available for event time data).
