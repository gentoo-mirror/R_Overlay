		Average Positive Predictive Values (AP) for Binary Outcomes and
		Censored Event Times // We provide tools to estimate two
		prediction performance metrics, the average positive predictive
		values (AP) as well as the well-known AUC (the area under the
		receiver operator characteristic curve) for risk scores or
		marker. The outcome of interest is either binary or censored
		event time. Note that for censored event time, our functions
		estimate the AP and the AUC are time-dependent for pre-
		specified time interval(s). A function that compares the APs of
		two risk scores/markers is also included. Optional outputs
		include positive predictive values and true positive fractions
		at the specified marker cut-off values, and a plot of the time-
		dependent AP versus time (available for event time data).
