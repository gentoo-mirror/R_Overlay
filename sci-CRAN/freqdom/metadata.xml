		Frequency Domain Based Analysis: Dynamic PCA // Implementation of
		dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA), simulation of VAR
		and VMA processes and frequency domain tools. These frequency
		domain methods for dimensionality reduction of multivariate
		time series were introduced by David Brillinger in his book
		Time Series (1974). We follow implementation guidelines as
		described in Hormann, Kidzinski and Hallin (2016), Dynamic
		Functional Principal Component doi:10.1111/rssb.12076.
