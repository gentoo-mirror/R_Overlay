		Stochastic Precipitation Downscaling with the RainFARM Method //
		An implementation of the RainFARM (Rainfall Filtered
		Autoregressive Model) stochastic precipitation downscaling
		method (Rebora et al. (2006) doi:10.1175/JHM517.1). Adapted for
		climate downscaling according to D'Onofrio et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1175/JHM-D-13-096.1 and for complex topography as in
		Terzago et al. (2018) doi:10.5194/nhess-18-2825-2018. The
		RainFARM method is based on the extrapolation to small scales
		of the Fourier spectrum of a large-scale precipitation field,
		using a fixed logarithmic slope and random phases at small
		scales, followed by a nonlinear transformation of the resulting
		linearly correlated stochastic field. RainFARM allows to
		generate ensembles of spatially downscaled precipitation fields
		which conserve precipitation at large scales and whose
		statistical properties are consistent with the small-scale
		statistics of observed precipitation, based only on knowledge
		of the large-scale precipitation field.
