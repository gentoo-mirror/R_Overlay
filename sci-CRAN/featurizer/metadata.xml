		Some Helper Functions that Help Create Features from Data // A
		collection of functions that would help one to build features
		based on external data. Very useful for Data Scientists in data
		to day work. Many functions create features using parallel
		computation. Since the nitty gritty of parallel computation is
		hidden under the hood, the user need not worry about creating
		clusters and shutting them down.
