		An Extension of the Taylor Diagram to Two-Dimensional Vector Data
		// A new diagram for the verification of vector variables
		(wind, current, etc) generated by multiple models against a set
		of observations is presented in this package. It has been
		designed as a generalization of the Taylor diagram to two
		dimensional quantities. It is based on the analysis of the two-
		dimensional structure of the mean squared error matrix between
		model and observations. The matrix is divided into the part
		corresponding to the relative rotation and the bias of the
		empirical orthogonal functions of the data. The full set of
		diagnostics produced by the analysis of the errors between
		model and observational vector datasets comprises the errors in
		the means, the analysis of the total variance of both datasets,
		the rotation matrix corresponding to the principal components
		in observation and model, the angle of rotation of model-
		derived empirical orthogonal functions respect to the ones from
		observations, the standard deviation of model and observations,
		the root mean squared error between both datasets and the
		squared two-dimensional correlation coefficient. See the output
		of function UVError() in this package.
