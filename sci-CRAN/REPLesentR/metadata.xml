		Presentations in the REPL // Create presentations and display
		them inside the R 'REPL' (Read-Eval-Print loop), aka the R
		console. Presentations can be written in 'RMarkdown' or any
		other text format. A set of convenient navigation options as
		well as code evaluation during a presentation is provided. It
		is great for tech talks with live coding examples and
		tutorials. While this is not a replacement for standard
		presentation formats, it's old-school looks might just be what
		sets it apart. This project has been inspired by the
		'REPLesent' project for presentations in the 'Scala' 'REPL'.
