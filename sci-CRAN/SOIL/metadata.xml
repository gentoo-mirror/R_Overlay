		Sparsity Oriented Importance Learning // Sparsity Oriented
		Importance Learning (SOIL) provides a new variable importance
		measure for high dimensional linear regression and logistic
		regression from a sparse penalization perspective, by taking
		into account the variable selection uncertainty via the use of
		a sensible model weighting. The package is an implementation of
		Ye, C., Yang, Y., and Yang, Y. (2017+).
