		Generalized Polynomial Modelling // Platform dedicated to the
		Global Modelling technique. Its aim is to obtain ordinary
		differential equations of polynomial form directly from time
		series. It can be applied to single or multiple time series
		under various conditions of noise, time series lengths,
		sampling, etc. This platform is developped at the Centre
		d'Etudes Spatiales de la Biosphere (CESBIO), UMR 5126
		UPS/CNRS/CNES/IRD, 18 av. Edouard Belin, 31401 TOULOUSE,
		FRANCE. The developments were funded by the French program Les
		Enveloppes Fluides et l'Environnement (LEFE, MANU, projets
		GloMo, SpatioGloMo and MoMu). The French program Defi InFiNiTi
		(CNRS) and PNTS are also acknowledged (projects Crops'IChaos
		and Musc  SlowFast).
