		Bayesian Distributed Lag Model Fitting for Binary and Count
		Response Data // Tools for fitting Bayesian Distributed Lag
		Models (DLMs) to longitudinal response data that is a count or
		binary. Count data is fit using negative binomial regression
		and binary is fit using quantile regression. The contribution
		of the lags are fit via b-splines. In addition, infers the
		predictor inclusion uncertainty. Multimomial models are not
		supported. Based on Dempsey and Wyse (2025)
