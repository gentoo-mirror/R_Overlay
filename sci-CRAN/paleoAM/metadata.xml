		Simulating Assemblage Models of Abundance for the Fossil Record
		// Provides functions for fitting abundance distributions over
		environmental gradients to the species in ecological
		communities, and tools for simulating the fossil assemblages
		from those abundance models for such communities, as well as
		simulating assemblages across various patterns of sedimentary
		history and sampling. These tools are for particular use with
		fossil records with detailed age models and abundance
		distributions used for calculating environmental gradients from
		ordinations or other indices based on fossil assemblages.
