		Fast Adaptive Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm // A collection of
		acceleration schemes for proximal gradient methods for
		estimating penalized regression parameters described in
		Goldstein, Studer, and Baraniuk (2016) arXiv:1411.3406. Schemes
		such as Fast Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding Algorithm
		(FISTA) by Beck and Teboulle (2009) doi:10.1137/080716542 and
		the adaptive stepsize rule introduced in Wright, Nowak, and
		Figueiredo (2009) doi:10.1109/TSP.2009.2016892 are included.
		You provide the objective function and proximal mappings, and
		it takes care of the issues like stepsize selection,
		acceleration, and stopping conditions for you.
