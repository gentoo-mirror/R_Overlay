		Calculation of Delta R Values // Computes the regional correction
		factor of 14C age offset in marine-derived samples (Delta R).
		This is possible with the recently established "marine13"
		calibration curve and the 'BchronCalibrate' function from the
		'Bchron' package. The algorithm of Delta R computation includes
		four steps: measure radiocarbon age of a marine sample;
		identify its true age; compute its modeled radiocarbon age
		corresponding to the true age; and finally calculate the
		difference between its measured and modeled radiocarbon ages.
		This package has functions that compute Delta R with three
		methods: by using marine samples with known collection dates
		(before 1950s), usually molluscan shells from museum
		collections, (function dr_shell()); by measuring other
		radioactive isotopes, mainly uranium-thorium (230Th/234U),
		ratio (dr_pair() function and the "pair" method in the dr_df()
		function); and finally by using a pair of coeval samples, one
		being marine and the other terrestrial (dr_pair() function and
		the "pair" method for the dr_df() function as well). Usually
		such samples originate from archaeological sites where the
		context, in which paired samples were found, is taken as a
		guarantee of their synchronicity. References: Oeschger H,
