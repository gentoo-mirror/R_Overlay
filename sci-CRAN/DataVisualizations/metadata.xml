		Visualizations of High-Dimensional Data // A collection of
		various visualizations methods is provided. With regards to
		high-dimensional data the heat map and silhouette plot for
		grouped data,visualizations of the distribution of distances,
		the scatter-density plot for two variables,the Shepard density
		plot as well as the Bland-Altman plot are presented here. For a
		classification of countries, a map of the world or Germany can
		be visualized. 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to
		inspect the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually
		through the combination of four methods.More detailed
		explanations can be found in the book of Thrun, M.C
		.:"Projection-Based Clustering through Self-Organization and
		Swarm Intelligence" (2018) DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9.
		Furthermore, for categorical features the ABC analysis improved
		Pie charts, slope charts and fan plots are usable.
		Additionally, for measurements across a geographic area an easy
		to use function for a Choropleth map is presented here.
