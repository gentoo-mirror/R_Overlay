		Visualizations of High-Dimensional Data // Various visualizations
		of high-dimensional data such as heat map and silhouette plot
		for grouped data, visualizations of the distribution of
		distances, the scatter-density plot for two variables, the
		Shepard density plot and many more are presented here.
		Additionally, 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to inspect
		the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through
		the combination of four methods. More detailed explanations can
		be found in the book of Thrun, M.C.:"Projection-Based
		Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence"
