		Visualizations of High-Dimensional Data // The flagship idea of
		'DataVisualizations' is the mirrored density plot (MD-plot)
		which is a PDE-optimized violin plot for either classified or
		non-classified multivariate data. The MD-plot is an alternative
		to the box-and-whisker diagram (box plot) and bean plot.
		Furthermore, a collection of various visualization methods for
		univariate data is provided. In the case of exploratory data
		analysis, 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to inspect the
		distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through a
		combination of four methods. One of these methods is the Pareto
		density estimation (PDE) of the probability density function
		(pdf). Additionally, visualizations of the distribution of
		distances using PDE, the scatter-density plot using PDE for two
		variables as well as the Shepard density plot and the Bland-
		Altman plot are presented here. Pertaining to classified high-
		dimensional data, a number of visualizations are described,
		such as f.ex. the heat map and silhouette plot. A political map
		of the world or Germany can be visualized with the additional
		information defined by a classification of countries or
		regions. By extending the political map further, an
		uncomplicated function for a Choropleth map can be used which
		is useful for measurements across a geographic area. For
		categorical features, the Pie charts, slope charts and fan
		plots, improved by the ABC analysis, become usable. More
		detailed explanations are found in the book by Thrun, M.C.:
		"Projection-Based Clustering through Self-Organization and
		Swarm Intelligence" (2018) doi:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9.
