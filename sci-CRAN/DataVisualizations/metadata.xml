		Visualizations of High-Dimensional Data // Gives access to data
		visualisation methods that are relevant from the data
		scientist's point of view. The flagship idea of
		'DataVisualizations' is the mirrored density plot (MD-plot) for
		either classified or non-classified multivariate data published
		in Thrun, M.C. et al.: "Analyzing the Fine Structure of
		Distributions" (2020), PLoS ONE,
		DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0238835. The MD-plot outperforms the
		box-and-whisker diagram (box plot), violin plot and bean plot
		and geom_violin plot of ggplot2. Furthermore, a collection of
		various visualization methods for univariate data is provided.
		In the case of exploratory data analysis, 'DataVisualizations'
		makes it possible to inspect the distribution of each feature
		of a dataset visually through a combination of four methods.
		One of these methods is the Pareto density estimation (PDE) of
		the probability density function (pdf). Additionally,
		visualizations of the distribution of distances using PDE, the
		scatter-density plot using PDE for two variables as well as the
		Shepard density plot and the Bland-Altman plot are presented
		here. Pertaining to classified high-dimensional data, a number
		of visualizations are described, such as f.ex. the heat map and
		silhouette plot. A political map of the world or Germany can be
		visualized with the additional information defined by a
		classification of countries or regions. By extending the
		political map further, an uncomplicated function for a
		Choropleth map can be used which is useful for measurements
		across a geographic area. For categorical features, the Pie
		charts, slope charts and fan plots, improved by the ABC
		analysis, become usable. More detailed explanations are found
		in the book by Thrun, M.C.: "Projection-Based Clustering
		through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018)
		DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9.
