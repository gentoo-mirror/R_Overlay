		Visualizations of High-Dimensional Data // A collection of
		various visualizations methods is provided. In the case of
		exploratory data analysis, 'DataVisualizations' makes it
		possible to inspect the distribution of each feature of a
		dataset visually through the combination of four methods. One
		of these methods is the Pareto density estimation (PDE) of the
		probability density function (pdf). The visualizations of the
		distribution of distances using PDE, the scatter-density plot
		using PDE for two variables, the Shepard density plot as well
		as the Bland-Altman plot are presented here. With regards to
		classified high-dimensional data several visualizations are
		presented, e.g. the heat map and silhouette plot. For a
		classification of countries, a map of the world or Germany can
		be visualized.  More detailed explanations can be found in the
		book of Thrun, M.C.:"Projection-Based Clustering through Self-
		Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018)
		DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9. Furthermore, for categorical
		features the ABC analysis improved Pie charts, slope charts and
		fan plots are usable. Additionally, for measurements across a
		geographic area an easy to use function for a Choropleth map is
		presented here. The flagship of this package is the mirrored
		density plot (MD-plot) which is a PDE-optimized violin plot for
		either classified or non-classified, univariate or multivariate
		data. The MD-plot is an alternative for the box-and-whisker
		diagram (box plot) and bean plot.
