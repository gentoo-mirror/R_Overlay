		R-Enzymology // Contains utilities for the analysis of Michaelian
		kinetic data. Beside the classical linearization methods
		(Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, Hanes-Woolf and Eisenthal-
		Cornish-Bowden), features include the ability to carry out
		weighted regression analysis that, in most cases, substantially
		improves the estimation of kinetic parameters (Aledo (2021)
		doi:10.1002/bmb.21522). To avoid data transformation and the
		potential biases introduced by them, the package also offers
		functions to directly fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten
		equation, either using ([S], v) or (time, [S]) data. Utilities
		to simulate substrate progress-curves (making use of the
		Lambert W function) are also provided. The package is
		accompanied of vignettes that aim to orientate the user in the
		choice of the most suitable method to estimate the kinetic
		parameter of an Michaelian enzyme.
