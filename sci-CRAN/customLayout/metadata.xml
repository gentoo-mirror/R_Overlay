		Arrange Elements on the R's Drawing Area or Inside the
		PowerPoint's Slide // Create complicated drawing areas for
		multiple elements by combining much simpler layouts. It is an
		extended version of layout function from the 'graphics'
		package, but it also works with 'grid' graphics. It also
		supports arranging elements inside 'PowerPoint' slides created
		using the 'officer' package.
