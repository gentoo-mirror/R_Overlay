		A GTK GUI for Fitting and Comparing GLM and GLMM // A
		'gWidgetsRGtk2' GUI for fitting and comparing GLM or GLMM
		(based on Douglas Bates' 'lme4' package). It is designed to
		make comparisons between numerous models easy, both numerically
		and graphically, which may be useful for teaching. Relevant
		plots are automatically produced for each model family.
		'R2STATS' is *not* a generic graphical interface for R, but a
		GUI for statistical modelling in a model comparison approach.
