		Implement Fleming-Viot-Dependent Dirichlet Processes // A
		Bayesian Nonparametric model for the study of time-evolving
		frequencies, which has become renowned in the study of
		population genetics. The model consists of a Hidden Markov
		Model (HMM) in which the latent signal is a distribution-valued
		stochastic process that takes the form of a finite mixture of
		Dirichlet Processes, indexed by vectors that count how many
		times each value is observed in the population. The package
		implements methodologies presented in Ascolani, Lijoi and
		Ruggiero (2021) doi:10.1214/20-BA1206 and Ascolani, Lijoi and
		Ruggiero (2023) doi:10.3150/22-BEJ1504 that make it possible to
		study the process at the time of data collection or to predict
		its evolution in future or in the past.
