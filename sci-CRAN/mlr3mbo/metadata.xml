		Flexible Bayesian Optimization // A modern and flexible approach
		to Bayesian Optimization / Model Based Optimization building on
		the 'bbotk' package. 'mlr3mbo' is a toolbox providing both
		ready-to-use optimization algorithms as well as their
		fundamental building blocks allowing for straightforward
		implementation of custom algorithms. Single- and multi-
		objective optimization is supported as well as mixed
		continuous, categorical and conditional search spaces.
		Moreover, using 'mlr3mbo' for hyperparameter optimization of
		machine learning models within the 'mlr3' ecosystem is
		straightforward via 'mlr3tuning'. Examples of ready-to-use
		optimization algorithms include Efficient Global Optimization
