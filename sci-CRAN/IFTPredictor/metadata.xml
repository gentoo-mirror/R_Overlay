		Predictions Using Item-Focused Tree Models // This function
		predicts item response probabilities and item responses using
		the item-focused tree model. The item-focused tree model
		combines logistic regression with recursive partitioning to
		detect Differential Item Functioning in dichotomous items. The
		model applies partitioning rules to the data, splitting it into
		homogeneous subgroups, and uses logistic regression within each
		subgroup to explain the data. Differential Item Functioning
		detection is achieved by examining potential group differences
		in item response patterns. This method is useful for
		understanding how different predictors, such as demographic or
		psychological factors, influence item responses across
		subgroups.
