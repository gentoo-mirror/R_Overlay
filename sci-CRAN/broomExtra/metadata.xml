		Enhancements for 'broom' and 'easystats' Package Families //
		Provides helper functions that assist in data analysis
		workflows involving regression analyses. The goal is to combine
		the functionality offered by different set of packages
		('broom', 'broom.mixed', 'parameters', and 'performance')
		through a common syntax to return tidy dataframes containing
		model parameters and performance measure summaries. The
		'grouped_' variants of the generics provides a convenient way
		to execute functions across a combination of grouping
		variable(s) in a dataframe.
