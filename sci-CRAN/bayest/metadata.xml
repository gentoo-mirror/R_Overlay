		Bayesian t-Test // Provides an Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo algorithm
		for Bayesian t-tests on the effect size. The underlying Gibbs
		sampler is based on a two-component Gaussian mixture and
		approximates the posterior distributions of the effect size,
		the difference of means and difference of standard deviations.
		A posterior analysis of the effect size via the region of
		practical equivalence is provided, too. For more details about
		the Gibbs sampler see Kelter (2019) arXiv:1906.07524.
