		Nonparametric Bootstrap Test with Pooled Resampling // Addressing
		crucial research questions often necessitates a small sample
		size due to factors such as distinctive target populations,
		rarity of the event under study, time and cost constraints,
		ethical concerns, or group-level unit of analysis. Many readily
		available analytic methods, however, do not accommodate small
		sample sizes, and the choice of the best method can be unclear.
		The 'npboottprm' package enables the execution of nonparametric
		bootstrap tests with pooled resampling to help fill this gap.
		Grounded in the statistical methods for small sample size
		studies detailed in Dwivedi, Mallawaarachchi, and Alvarado
		(2017) doi:10.1002/sim.7263, the package facilitates a range of
		statistical tests, encompassing independent t-tests, paired
		t-tests, and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) F-tests. The
		nonparboot() function undertakes essential computations,
		yielding detailed outputs which include test statistics, effect
		sizes, confidence intervals, and bootstrap distributions.
		Further, 'npboottprm' incorporates an interactive 'shiny' web
		application, nonparboot_app(), offering intuitive, user-
		friendly data exploration.
