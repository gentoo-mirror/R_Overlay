		Suite of Functions to Help Get Plot Elements Exactly Where You
		Want Them // Provides a selection of tools that make it easier
		to place elements onto a (base R) plot exactly where you want
		them. It allows users to identify points and distances on a
		plot in terms of inches, pixels, margin lines, data units, and
		proportions of the plotting space, all in a manner more simple
		than manipulating par().
