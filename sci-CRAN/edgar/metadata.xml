		Platform for EDGAR Filing Management and Textual Analysis // In
		the USA, companies file different forms with the U.S.
		Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through EDGAR
		(Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system).
		The EDGAR database automated system collects all the different
		necessary filings and makes it publicly available. Investors,
		regulators, and researchers often require these forms for
		various purposes. This package helps in bulk data gathering and
		textual analysis of EDGAR filings. It downloads filings from
		SEC server in bulk with a single query. Additionally, it
		provides various useful functions: extracts 8-K triggering
		events, extract "Business (Item 1)" and "Management's
		Discussion and Analysis(Item 7)" sections of annual statements,
		search filings for desired words, provides sentiment measures,
		parse filing header information, and provides HTML view of SEC
		filings.
