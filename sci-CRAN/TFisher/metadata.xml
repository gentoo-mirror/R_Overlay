		Optimal Thresholding Fisher's P-Value Combination Method // We
		provide the cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile,
		and statistical power calculator for a collection of
		thresholding Fisher's p-value combination methods, including
		Fisher's p-value combination method, truncated product method
		and, in particular, soft-thresholding Fisher's p-value
		combination method which is proven to be optimal in some
		context of signal detection. The p-value calculator for the
		omnibus version of these tests are also included. For
		reference, please see Hong Zhang and Zheyang Wu. "Optimal
		Thresholding of Fisher's P-value Combination Tests for Signal
		Detection", submitted.
