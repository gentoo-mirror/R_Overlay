		A General Framework for Flexible Multi-State Survival Modelling
		// A general estimation framework for multi-state Markov
		processes with flexible specification of the transition
		intensities. The log-transition intensities can be specified
		through Generalised Additive Models which allow for virtually
		any type of covariate effect. Elementary specifications such as
		time-homogeneous processes and simple parametric forms are also
		supported. There are no limitations on the type of process one
		can assume, with both forward and backward transitions allowed
		and virtually any number of states.
