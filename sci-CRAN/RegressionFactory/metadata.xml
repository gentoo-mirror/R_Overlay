		Expander Functions for Generating Full Gradient and Hessian from
		Single-Slot and Multi-Slot Base Distributions // The expander
		functions rely on the mathematics developed for the Hessian-
		definiteness invariance theorem for linear projection
		transformations of variables, described in authors' paper, to
		generate the full, high-dimensional gradient and Hessian from
		the lower-dimensional derivative objects. This greatly relieves
		the computational burden of generating the regression-function
		derivatives, which in turn can be fed into any optimization
		routine that utilizes such derivatives. The theorem guarantees
		that Hessian definiteness is preserved, meaning that reasoning
		about this property can be performed in the low-dimensional
		space of the base distribution. This is often a much easier
		task than its equivalent in the full, high-dimensional space.
		Definiteness of Hessian can be useful in selecting
		optimization/sampling algorithms such as Newton-Raphson
		optimization or its sampling equivalent, the Stochastic Newton
		Sampler. Finally, in addition to being a computational tool,
		the regression expansion framework is of conceptual value by
		offering new opportunities to generate novel regression
		problems.
