		Implementation of the Vegetation Model ModVege // Run grass
		growth simulations using a grass growth model based on ModVege
		(Jouven, M., P. Carrre, and R. Baumont "Model Predicting
		Dynamics of Biomass, Structure and Digestibility of Herbage in
		Managed Permanent Pastures. 1. Model Description." (2006)
		doi:10.1111/j.1365-2494.2006.00515.x). The implementation in
		this package contains a few additions to the above cited
		version of ModVege, such as simulations of management
		decisions, and influences of snow cover. As such, the model is
		fit to simulate grass growth in mountainous regions, such as
		the Swiss Alps. The package also contains routines for
		calibrating the model and helpful tools for analysing model
		outputs and performance.
