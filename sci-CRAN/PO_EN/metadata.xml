		An Elastic-Net Regularized Presence-Only Model // Presence-only
		model with Elastic Net penalty is a regularized generalized
		linear model training on the presence-absence response. This
		package provides functions for tuning and fitting the presence-
		only model. The presence-only model can be used to predict
		regulatory effects of genetic variants at sequence-level
		resolution by integrating a large number of epigenetic features
		and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs).
