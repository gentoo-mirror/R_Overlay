		Estimation of Ploidy and Detection of Aneuploidy Using Genotyping
		Data // Provides functions for estimating ploidy levels and
		detecting aneuploidy in individuals using allele intensities or
		allele count data from high-throughput genotyping platforms,
		including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and
		sequencing-based technologies. Implements an extended version
		of the 'PennCNV' signal standardization method by Wang et al.
		(2007) doi:10.1101/gr.6861907 for higher ploidy levels.
		Computes B-allele frequencies (BAF), z-scores, and identifies
		copy number variation patterns.
