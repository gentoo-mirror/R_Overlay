		Continuous-Time Multivariate Analysis // Implements a basis
		function or functional data analysis framework for several
		techniques of multivariate analysis in continuous-time setting.
		Specifically, we introduced continuous-time analogues of
		several classical techniques of multivariate analysis, such as
		principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis,
		Fisher linear discriminant analysis, K-means clustering, and so
		on. Details are in Philip T Reiss and Biplab Paul (2022)
		"Continuous-time multivariate analysis"; James O Ramsay,
		Bernard W Silverman (2005) ISBN:978-0-387-22751-1 "Functional
		Data Analysis"; James O Ramsay, Giles Hooker and Spencer Graves
		(2009) ISBN:978-0-387-98185-7 "Functional Data Analysis with R
		and MATLAB".
