		Continuous-Time Multivariate Analysis // Implements a basis
		function or functional data analysis framework for several
		techniques of multivariate analysis in continuous-time setting.
		Specifically, we introduced continuous-time analogues of
		several classical techniques of multivariate analysis, such as
		principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis,
		Fisher linear discriminant analysis, K-means clustering, and so
		on. Details are in Biplab Paul, Philip T. Reiss and Erjia Cui
		(2023) "Continuous-time multivariate analysis"
