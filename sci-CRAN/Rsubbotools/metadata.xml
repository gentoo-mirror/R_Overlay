		Fast Estimation of Subbottin and AEP Distributions (Generalized
		Error Distribution) // Create densities, probabilities, random
		numbers, quantiles, and maximum likelihood estimation for
		several distributions, mainly the symmetric and asymmetric
		power exponential (AEP), a.k.a. the Subbottin family of
		distributions, also known as the generalized error
		distribution. Estimation is made using the design of Bottazzi
		(2004) https://ideas.repec.org/p/ssa/lemwps/2004-14.html, where
		the likelihood is maximized by several optimization procedures
		using the 'GNU Scientific Library (GSL)', translated to 'C++'
		code, which makes it both fast and accurate. The package also
		provides methods for the gamma, Laplace, and Asymmetric Laplace
		distributions.
