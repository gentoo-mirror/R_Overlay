		Wavelet Decomposition Based Hybrid Machine Learning Models //
		Wavelet decomposes a series into multiple sub series called
		detailed and smooth components which helps to capture
		volatility at multi resolution level by various models. Two
		hybrid Machine Learning (ML) models (Artificial Neural Network
		and Support Vector Regression have been used) have been
		developed in combination with stochastic models, feature
		selection, and optimization algorithms for prediction of the
		data. The algorithms have been developed following Paul and
		Garai (2021)  doi:10.1007/s00500-021-06087-4.
