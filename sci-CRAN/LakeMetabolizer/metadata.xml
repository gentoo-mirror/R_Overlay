		Tools for the Analysis of Ecosystem Metabolism // A collection of
		tools for the calculation of freewater metabolism from in situ
		time series of dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and,
		optionally, additional environmental variables. LakeMetabolizer
		implements 5 different metabolism models with diverse
		statistical underpinnings: bookkeeping, ordinary least squares,
		maximum likelihood, Kalman filter, and Bayesian. Each of these
		5 metabolism models can be combined with 1 of 7 models for
		computing the coefficient of gas exchange across the airwater
		interface (k). LakeMetabolizer also features a variety of
		supporting functions that compute conversions and implement
		calculations commonly applied to raw data prior to estimating
		metabolism (e.g., oxygen saturation and optical conversion
		models).
