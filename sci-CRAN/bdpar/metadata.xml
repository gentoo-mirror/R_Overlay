		Big Data Preprocessing Architecture // Provide a tool to easily
		build customized data flows to pre-process large volumes of
		information from different sources. To this end, 'bdpar' allows
		to (i) easily use and create new functionalities and (ii)
		develop new data source extractors according to the user needs.
		Additionally, the package provides by default a predefined data
		flow to extract and pre-process the most relevant information
		(tokens, dates, ... ) from some textual sources (SMS, Email,
		YouTube comments).
