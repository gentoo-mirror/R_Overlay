		Main Effects and Interactions in Mixed and Incomplete Data //
		Estimation of main effects and interactions in mixed data sets
		with missing values. Numeric, binary and count variables are
		supported. Main effects and interactions are modelled using an
		exponential family parametric model. Particular examples
		include the log-linear model for count data and the linear
		model for numeric data. Estimation is done through a convex
		program where main effects are assumed sparse and the
		interactions low-rank. Genevive Robin, Olga Klopp, Julie Josse,
