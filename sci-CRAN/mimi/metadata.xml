		Main Effects and Interactions in Mixed and Incomplete Data //
		Generalized low-rank models for mixed and incomplete data
		frames. The main function may be used for dimensionality
		reduction of imputation of numeric, binary and count data
		(simultaneously). Main effects such as column means, group
		effects, or effects of row-column side information (e.g.
		user/item attributes in recommendation system) may also be
		modelled in addition to the low-rank model. Genevive Robin,
