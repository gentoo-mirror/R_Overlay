		Child Development Data // Measuring child development starts by
		collecting responses to developmental milestones, such as "able
		to sit" or "says two words". There are many ways to combine
		such responses into summaries. The package bundles publicly
		available datasets with individual milestone data for children
		aged 0-5 years, with the aim of supporting the construction,
		evaluation, validation and interpretation of methodologies that
		aggregate milestone data into informative measures of child
		development.
