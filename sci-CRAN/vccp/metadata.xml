		Vine Copula Change Point Detection in Multivariate Time Series //
		Implements the Vine Copula Change Point (VCCP) methodology for
		the estimation of the number and location of multiple change
		points in the vine copula structure of multivariate time
		series. The method uses vine copulas, an adapted binary
		segmentation algorithm to identify multiple change points, and
		a likelihood ratio test for inference. The vine copulas allow
		for various forms of dependence between time series including
		tail, symmetric and asymmetric dependence. The functions have
		been extensively tested on simulated multivariate time series
		data and fMRI data. For details on the VCCP methodology, please
		see Xiong  Cribben (2021).
