		Simulation of Sediment Archived Climate Proxy Records // Proxy
		forward modelling for sediment archived climate proxies such as
		Mg/Ca, d18O or Alkenones. The user provides a hypothesised
		"true" past climate, such as output from a climate model, and
		details of the sedimentation rate and sampling scheme of a
		sediment core. Sedproxy returns simulated proxy records.
		Implements the methods described in Dolman and Laepple (2018)
