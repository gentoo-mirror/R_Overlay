		Simulate Complex Traits from Genotypes // Simulate complex traits
		given a SNP genotype matrix and model parameters (the desired
		heritability, number of causal loci, and either the true
		ancestral allele frequencies used to generate the genotypes or
		the mean kinship for a real dataset).  Emphasis on avoiding
		common biases due to the use of estimated allele frequencies.
		The code selects random loci to be causal, constructs
		coefficients for these loci and random independent non-genetic
		effects.  Traits can follow three models: random coefficients,
		fixed effect sizes, and infinitesimal (multivariate normal).
		GWAS method benchmarking functions are also provided.
		Partially described in Yao and Ochoa (2019) doi:10.1101/858399.
