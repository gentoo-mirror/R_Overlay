		Safe Semi-Supervised Learning Tools // Implements several safe
		graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms. The first
		algorithm is the Semi-Supervised Semi-Parametric Model (S4PM)
		and the fast Anchor Graph version of this approach.  For
		additional technical details, refer to Culp and Ryan (2013)
		http://jmlr.org/papers/v14/culp13a.html, Ryan and Culp (2015)
		http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/ryan15a.html and the package
		vignette. The underlying fitting routines are executed in C++.
		All tuning parameter estimation is optimized using K-fold
		Cross-Validation.
