		Elicitation of Independent Conditional Means Priors for
		Generalised Linear Models // Functions are provided to
		facilitate prior elicitation for Bayesian generalised linear
		models using independent conditional means priors. The package
		supports the elicitation of multivariate normal priors for
		generalised linear models. The approach can be applied to
		indirect elicitation for a generalised linear model that is
		linear in the parameters. The package is designed such that the
		facilitator executes functions within the R console during the
		elicitation session to provide graphical and numerical feedback
		at each design point. Various methodologies for eliciting
		fractiles (equivalently, percentiles or quantiles) are
		supported, including versions of the approach of Hosack et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1016/j.ress.2017.06.011. For example, experts may
		be asked to provide central credible intervals that correspond
		to a certain probability. Or experts may be allowed to vary the
		probability allocated to the central credible interval for each
		design point. Additionally, a median may or may not be
		elicited.
