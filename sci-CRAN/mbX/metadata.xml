		A Comprehensive Microbiome Data Processing Pipeline // Provides
		tools for cleaning, processing, and preparing microbiome
		sequencing data (e.g., 16S rRNA) for downstream analysis.
		Supports CSV, TXT, and 'Excel' file formats. The main function,
		ezclean(), automates microbiome data transformation, including
		format validation, transposition, numeric conversion, and
		metadata integration. Also ensures efficient handling of
		taxonomic levels, resolves duplicated taxa entries, and outputs
		a well-structured, analysis-ready dataset.
