		Examples using 'RcppClassic' to Interface R and C++ // The 'Rcpp'
		package contains a C++ library that facilitates the integration
		of R and C++ in various ways via a rich API. This API was
		preceded by an earlier version which has been deprecated since
		2010 (but is still supported to provide backwards compatibility
		in the package 'RcppClassic').  This package
		'RcppClassicExamples' provides usage examples for the older,
		deprecated API. There is also a corresponding package
		'RcppExamples' with examples for the newer, current API which
		we strongly recommend as the basis for all new development.
