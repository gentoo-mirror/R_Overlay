		Yang and Prentice Model with Piecewise Exponential Baseline
		Distribution // Semiparametric modeling of lifetime data with
		crossing survival curves via Yang and Prentice model with
		piecewise exponential baseline distribution. Details about the
		model can be found in Demarqui and Mayrink (2019)
		arXiv:1910.02406. Model fitting carried out via likelihood-
		based and Bayesian approaches. The package also provides point
		and interval estimation for the crossing survival times.
