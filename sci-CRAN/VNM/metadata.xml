		Finding Multiple-Objective Optimal Designs for the 4-Parameter
		Logistic Model // Provide tools for finding multiple-objective
		optimal designs for estimating the shape of dose-response, the
		ED50 (the dose producing an effect midway between the expected
		responses at the extreme doses) and the MED (the minimum
		effective dose level) for the 2,3,4-parameter logistic models
		and for evaluating its efficiencies for the three objectives.
		The acronym VNM stands for V-algorithm using Newton Raphson
		method to search multiple-objective optimal design.
