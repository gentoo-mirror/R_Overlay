		Multivariate Covariance Generalized Linear Models // Fitting
		multivariate covariance generalized linear models (McGLMs) to
		data.  McGLM is a general framework for non-normal multivariate
		data analysis, designed to handle multivariate response
		variables, along with a wide range of temporal and spatial
		correlation structures defined in terms of a covariance link
		function combined with a matrix linear predictor involving
		known matrices. The models take non-normality into account in
		the conventional way by means of a variance function, and the
		mean structure is modelled by means of a link function and a
		linear predictor. The models are fitted using an efficient
		Newton scoring algorithm based on quasi-likelihood and Pearson
		estimating functions, using only second-moment assumptions.
		This provides a unified approach to a wide variety of different
		types of response variables and covariance structures,
		including multivariate extensions of repeated measures, time
		series, longitudinal, spatial and spatio-temporal structures.
		The package offers a user-friendly interface for fitting McGLMs
		similar to the glm() R function. See Bonat (2018)
