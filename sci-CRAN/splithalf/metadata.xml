		Calculate Task Split Half Reliability Estimates // A series of
		functions to calculate the split half reliability of RT based
		tasks. The core function performs a Monte Carlo procedure to
		process a user defined number of random splits in order to
		provide a better reliability estimate. The current functions
		target the dot- probe task, however, can be modified for other
		tasks.
