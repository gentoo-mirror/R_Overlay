		C++ Classes to Embed R in C++ Applications // C++ classes to
		embed R in C++ applications A C++ class providing the R
		interpreter is offered by this package making it easier to have
		"R inside" your C++ application. As R itself is embedded into
		your application, a shared library build of R is required. This
		works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows provided you use the
		same tools used to build R itself. d Numerous examples are
		provided in the eight subdirectories of the examples/ directory
		of the installed package: standard, 'mpi' (for parallel
		computing), 'qt' (showing how to embed 'RInside' inside a Qt
		GUI application), 'wt' (showing how to build a "web-
		application" using the Wt toolkit), 'armadillo' (for 'RInside'
		use with 'RcppArmadillo') and 'eigen' (for 'RInside' use with
		'RcppEigen').  The examples use 'GNUmakefile(s)' with GNU
		extensions, so a GNU make is required (and will use the
		'GNUmakefile' automatically). 'Doxygen'-generated documentation
		of the C++ classes is available at the 'RInside' website as
		well.
