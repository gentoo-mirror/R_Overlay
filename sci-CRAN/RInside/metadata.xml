		C++ Classes to Embed R in C++ Applications // C++ classes to
		embed R in C++ applications The 'RInside' packages makes it
		easier to have "R inside" your C++ application by providing a
		C++ wrapper class providing the R interpreter. . As R itself is
		embedded into your application, a shared library build of R is
		required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows
		provided you use the same tools used to build R itself. .
		Numerous examples are provided in the eight subdirectories of
		the examples/ directory of the installed package: standard, mpi
		(for parallel computing) qt (showing how to embed 'RInside'
		inside a Qt GUI application), wt (showing how to build a "web-
		application" using the Wt toolkit), armadillo (for 'RInside'
		use with 'RcppArmadillo') and eigen (for 'RInside' use with
		'RcppEigen'). The example use GNUmakefile(s) with GNU
		extensions, so a GNU make is required (and will use the
		GNUmakefile automatically). . Doxygen-generated documentation
		of the C++ classes is available at the 'RInside' website as
		well.
