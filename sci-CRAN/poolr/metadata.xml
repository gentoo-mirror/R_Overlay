		Methods for Pooling P-Values from (Dependent) Tests // Functions
		for pooling/combining the results (i.e., p-values) from
		(dependent) hypothesis tests. Included are Fisher's method,
		Stouffer's method, the inverse chi-square method, the
		Bonferroni method, Tippett's method, and the binomial test.
		Each method can be adjusted based on an estimate of the
		effective number of tests or using empirically derived null
		distribution using pseudo replicates. For Fisher's, Stouffer's,
		and the inverse chi-square method, direct generalizations based
		on multivariate theory are also available (leading to Brown's
		method, Strube's method, and the generalized inverse chi-square
		method). An introduction can be found in Cinar and Viechtbauer
