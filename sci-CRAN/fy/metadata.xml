		Utilities for Financial Years // In Australia, a financial year
		(or fiscal year) is the period from 1 July to 30 June of the
		following calendar year. As such, many databases need to
		represent and validate financial years efficiently. While the
		use of integer years with a convention that they represent the
		year ending is common, it may lead to ambiguity with calendar
		years. On the other hand, string representations may be too
		inefficient and do not easily admit arithmetic operations. This
		package tries to make validation of financial years quicker
		while retaining clarity.
