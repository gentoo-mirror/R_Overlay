		Implementation of SparseMDC Algorithm // Implements the algorithm
		described in Barron, M., and Li, J. (Not yet published). This
		algorithm clusters samples from multiple ordered populations,
		links the clusters across the conditions and identifies marker
		genes for these changes. The package was designed for scRNA-Seq
		data but is also applicable to many other data types, just
		replace cells with samples and genes with variables. The
		package also contains functions for estimating the parameters
		for SparseMDC as outlined in the paper. We recommend that users
		further select their marker genes using the magnitude of the
		cluster centers.
