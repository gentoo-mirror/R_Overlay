		Advanced Policing Techniques for the Board Game "Letters from
		Whitechapel" // Provides a set of functions to make tracking
		the hidden movements of the 'Jack' player easier. By tracking
		every possible path Jack might have traveled from the point of
		the initial murder including special movement such as through
		alleyways and via carriages, the police can more accurately
		narrow the field of their search. Additionally, by tracking all
		possible hideouts from round to round, rounds 3 and 4 should
		have a vastly reduced field of search.
