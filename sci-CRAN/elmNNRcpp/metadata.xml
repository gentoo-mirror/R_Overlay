		The Extreme Learning Machine Algorithm // Training and predict
		functions for Single Hidden-layer Feedforward Neural Networks
		(SLFN) using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. The
		ELM algorithm differs from the traditional gradient-based
		algorithms for very short training times (it doesn't need any
		iterative tuning, this makes learning time very fast) and there
		is no need to set any other parameters like learning rate,
		momentum, epochs, etc. This is a reimplementation of the
		'elmNN' package using 'RcppArmadillo' after the 'elmNN' package
		was archived. For more information, see "Extreme learning
		machine: Theory and applications" by Guang-Bin Huang, Qin-Yu
		Zhu, Chee-Kheong Siew (2006), Elsevier B.V,
		doi:10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.126.
