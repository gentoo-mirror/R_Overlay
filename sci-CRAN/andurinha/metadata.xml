		Make Spectroscopic Data Processing Easier // The goal of
		'andurinha' is provide a fast and friendly way to process
		spectroscopic data. It is intended for processing several
		spectra of samples with similar composition (tens to hundreds
		of spectra). It compiles spectroscopy data files, produces
		standardized and second derivative spectra, finds peaks and
		allows to select the most significant ones based on the second
		derivative/absorbance sum spectrum. It also provides functions
		for graphic evaluation of the outputs.
