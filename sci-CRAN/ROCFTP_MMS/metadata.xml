		Perfect Sampling // The algorithm provided in this package
		generates perfect sample for unimodal or multimodal posteriors.
		Read Once Coupling From The Past, with Metropolis-Multishift is
		used to generate a perfect sample for a given posterior density
		based on the two extreme starting paths, minimum and maximum of
		the most interest range of the posterior. It uses the monotone
		random operation of multishift coupler which allows to sandwich
		all of the state space in one point. It means both Markov
		Chains starting from the maximum and minimum will be coalesced.
		The generated sample is independent from the starting points.
		It is useful for mixture distributions too. The output of this
		function is a real value as an exact draw from the posterior
		distribution.
