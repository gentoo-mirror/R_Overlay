		Correcting Misclassified Binary Outcomes in Association Studies
		// Use frequentist and Bayesian methods to estimate parameters
		from a binary outcome misclassification model. These methods
		correct for the problem of "label switching" by assuming that
		correct outcome classification occurs in at least 50% of
		observations. A description of the analysis methods is
		available in Hochstedler and Wells (2023) arXiv:2303.10215.
