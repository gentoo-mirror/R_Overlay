		Model Averaging Prediction of Personalized Survival Probabilities
		// Provide model averaging-based approaches that can be used to
		predict personalized survival probabilities. The key underlying
		idea is to approximate the conditional survival function using
		a weighted average of multiple candidate models. Two scenarios
		of candidate models are allowed: (Scenario 1) partial linear
		Cox model and (Scenario 2) time-varying coefficient Cox model.
		A reference of the underlying methods is Li and Wang (2023)
