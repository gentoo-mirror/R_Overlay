		Discriminative Parameter Learning of Bayesian Networks by
		Differential Evolution // Implements Differential Evolution
		(DE) to train parameters of Bayesian Networks for optimizing
		the Conditional Log-Likelihood (Discriminative Learning)
		instead of the log-likelihood (Generative Learning). Any given
		Bayesian Network structure encodes assumptions about
		conditional independencies among the attributes and will result
		in an error if they do not hold in the data. Such an error
		includes the classification dimension. The main goal of
		Discriminative learning is to minimize this type of error. This
		package provides main variants of differential evolution
		described in Price  Storn (1996) doi:10.1109/ICEC.1996.542711
		and recent ones, described in Tanabe  Fukunaga (2014)
		doi:10.1109/CEC.2014.6900380 and Zhang  Sanderson (2009)
		doi:10.1109/TEVC.2009.2014613 with adaptation mechanism for
		factor mutarion and crossover rate.
