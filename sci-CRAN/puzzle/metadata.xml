		Assembling Data Sets for Non-Linear Mixed Effects Modeling // To
		Simplify the time consuming and error prone task of assembling
		complex data sets for non-linear mixed effects modeling. Users
		are able to select from different absorption processes such as
		zero and first order, or a combination of both. Furthermore,
		data sets containing data from several entities, responses, and
		covariates can be simultaneously assembled.
