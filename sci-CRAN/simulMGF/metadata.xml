		Simulate SNP Matrix, Phenotype and Genotypic Effects // Simulate
		genotypes in SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) Matrix as
		random numbers from an uniform distribution, for diploid
		organisms (coded by 0, 1, 2), Sikorska et al., (2013)
		doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-166, or half-sib/full-sib SNP matrix
		from real or simulated parents SNP data, assuming mendelian
		segregation. Simulate phenotypic traits for real or simulated
		SNP data, controlled by a specific number of quantitative trait
		loci  and their effects, sampled from a Normal or an Uniform
		distributions, assuming a pure additive model. This is useful
		for testing association and genomic prediction models or for
		educational purposes.
