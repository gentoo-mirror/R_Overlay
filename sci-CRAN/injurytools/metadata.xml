		analysis aims to identify and describe the magnitude of the
		injury problem, and to gain more insights (e.g. determine
		potential risk factors) by statistical modelling approaches.

		utilities that simplify such analyses. It offers functions for
		data preparation, informative visualizations and descriptive
		and model-based analyses.
