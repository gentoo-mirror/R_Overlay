		INGARCH and GLARMA Models for Count Time Series in Fable
		Framework // Provides a tidy R interface for count time series
		analysis. It includes implementation of the INGARCH (Integer
		Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
		model from the 'tscount' package and the GLARMA (Generalized
		Linear Autoregressive Moving Averages) model from the 'glarma'
		package. Additionally, it offers automated parameter selection
		algorithms based on the minimization of a penalized likelihood.
