		Cone Constrained Convex Problems // Routines for solving convex
		optimization problems with cone constraints by means of
		interior-point methods. The implemented algorithms are
		partially ported from CVXOPT, a Python module for convex
		optimization (see https://cvxopt.org for more information).
