		Tools for Applying Distribution Mapping Based Transfer Learning
		// Implementation of a transfer learning framework employing
		distribution mapping based domain transfer. Uses the renowned
		concept of histogram matching (see Gonzalez and Fittes (1977)
		doi:10.1016/0094-114X(77)90062-3, Gonzalez and Woods (2008)
		isbn:9780131687288) and extends it to include distribution
		measures like kernel density estimates (KDE; see Wand and Jones
		(1995) isbn:978-0-412-55270-0, Jones et al. (1996)
		doi:10.2307/2291420). In the typical application scenario, one
		can use the underlying sample distributions (histogram or KDE)
		to generate a map between two distinct but related domains to
		transfer the target data to the source domain and utilize the
		available source data for better predictive modeling design.
		Suitable for the case where a one-to-one sample matching is not
		possible, thus one needs to transform the underlying data
		distribution to utilize the more available data for modeling.
