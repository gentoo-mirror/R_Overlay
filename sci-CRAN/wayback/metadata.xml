		Rock Solid Package Installation for Legacy R Versions // Make
		sure packages are available at runtime without any setup.
		Package installation, reproducibility and exchanging code can
		be frustrating especially if code is used on older R versions.
		Often it is hard to puzzle out which package versions are able
		to work together after some years have passed and packages
		evolved further and further. The 'wayback' package aims to make
		this process as painless and robust as possible by using
		'MRAN's 'CRAN' snapshots to build local package libraries from
		way back.
