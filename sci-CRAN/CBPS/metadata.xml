		Covariate Balancing Propensity Score // Implements the covariate
		balancing propensity score (CBPS) proposed by Imai and Ratkovic
		(2014) DOI:10.1111/rssb.12027. The propensity score is
		estimated such that it maximizes the resulting covariate
		balance as well as the prediction of treatment assignment. The
		method, therefore, avoids an iteration between model fitting
		and balance checking.  The package also implements optimal CBPS
		from Fan et al. (in-press) DOI:10.1080/07350015.2021.2002159,
		several extensions of the CBPS beyond the cross-sectional,
		binary treatment setting. They include the CBPS for
		longitudinal settings so that it can be used in conjunction
		with marginal structural models from Imai and Ratkovic (2015)
		DOI:10.1080/01621459.2014.956872, treatments with three- and
		four-valued treatment variables, continuous-valued treatments
		from Fong, Hazlett, and Imai (2018) DOI:10.1214/17-AOAS1101,
		propensity score estimation with a large number of covariates
		from Ning, Peng, and Imai (2020) DOI:10.1093/biomet/asaa020,
		and the situation with multiple distinct binary treatments
		administered simultaneously. In the future it will be extended
		to other settings including the generalization of experimental
		and instrumental variable estimates.
