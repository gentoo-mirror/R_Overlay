		Covariate Balancing Propensity Score // Implements the covariate
		balancing propensity score (CBPS) proposed by Imai and Ratkovic
		(2014) DOI:10.1111/rssb.12027. The propensity score is
		estimated such that it maximizes the resulting covariate
		balance as well as the prediction of treatment assignment. The
		method, therefore, avoids an iteration between model fitting
		and balance checking. The package also implements several
		extensions of the CBPS beyond the cross-sectional, binary
		treatment setting. The current version implements the CBPS for
		longitudinal settings so that it can be used in conjunction
		with marginal structural models from Imai and Ratkovic (2015)
		DOI:10.1080/01621459.2014.956872, treatments with three- and
		four- valued treatment variables, continuous-valued treatments
		from Fong, Hazlett, and Imai (2015)
		http://imai.princeton.edu/research/files/CBGPS.pdf, and the
		situation with multiple distinct binary treatments administered
		simultaneously. In the future it will be extended to other
		settings including the generalization of experimental and
		instrumental variable estimates. Recently we have added the
		optimal CBPS which chooses the optimal balancing function and
		results in doubly robust and efficient estimator for the
		treatment effect as well as high dimensional CBPS when a large
		number of covariates exist.
