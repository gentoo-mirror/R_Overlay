		Risk Measure Calculation in Financial TS // Enables the user to
		calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by
		means of various parametric and semiparametric GARCH-type
		models. For the latter the estimation of the nonparametric
		scale function is carried out by means of a data-driven
		smoothing approach. Model quality, in terms of forecasting VaR
		and ES, can be assessed by means of various backtesting methods
		such as the traffic light test for VaR and a newly developed
		traffic light test for ES. The approaches implemented in this
		package are described in e.g. Feng Y., Beran J., Letmathe S.
		and Ghosh S. https://ideas.repec.org/p/pdn/ciepap/137.html as
		well as Letmathe S., Feng Y. and Uhde A. (2021)
