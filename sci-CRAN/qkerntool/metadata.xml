		Q-Kernel-Based and Conditionally Negative Definite Kernel-Based
		Machine Learning Tools // Nonlinear machine learning tool for
		classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction. It
		integrates 12 q-kernel functions and 14 conditional negative
		definite kernel functions and includes the q-kernel and
		conditional negative definite kernel version of density-based
		spatial clustering of applications with noise, spectral
		clustering, generalized discriminant analysis, principal
		component analysis, multidimensional scaling, locally linear
		embedding, Sammon's mapping and t-Distributed stochastic
		neighbor embedding.
