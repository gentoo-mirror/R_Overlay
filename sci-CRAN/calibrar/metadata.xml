		Automated Parameter Estimation for Complex Models // General
		optimisation and specific tools for the parameter estimation
		(i.e. calibration) of complex models, including stochastic
		ones. It implements generic functions that can be used for
		fitting any type of models, especially those with non-
		differentiable objective functions, with the same syntax as
		base::optim. It supports multiple phases estimation (sequential
		parameter masking), constrained optimization (bounding box
		restrictions) and automatic parallel computation of numerical
		gradients. Some common maximum likelihood estimation methods
		and automated construction of the objective function from
		simulated model outputs is provided. See https://roliveros-
		ramos.github.io/calibrar/ for more details.
