		Persistence Homology Utilities // A low-level package for hosting
		persistence data. It is part of the 'TDAverse' suite of
		packages, which is designed to provide a collection of packages
		for enabling machine learning and data science tasks using
		persistent homology. Implements a class for hosting persistence
		data, a number of coercers from and to already existing and
		used data structures from other packages and functions to
		compute distances between persistence diagrams. A formal
		definition and study of bottleneck and Wasserstein distances
		can be found in Bubenik, Scott and Stanley (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s41468-022-00103-8. Their implementation in
		'phutil' relies on the 'C++' Hera library developed by Kerber,
		Morozov and Nigmetov (2017) doi:10.1145/3064175.
