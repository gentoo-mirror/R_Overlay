		Working with Files from 'LexisNexis' // My PhD supervisor once
		told me that everyone doing newspaper analysis starts by
		writing code to read in files from the 'LexisNexis' newspaper
		archive (retrieved e.g., from https://www.lexisnexis.com/ or
		any of the partner sites). However, while this is a nice
		exercise I do recommend, not everyone has the time. This
		package takes files downloaded from the newspaper archive of
		'LexisNexis', reads them into R and offers functions for
		further processing.
