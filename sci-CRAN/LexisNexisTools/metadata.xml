		Working with Files from 'LexisNexis' // My PhD supervisor once
		told me that everyone doing newspaper analysis starts by
		writing code to read in files from the 'LexisNexis' newspaper
		archive (retrieved e.g., from http://www.nexis.com/ or any of
		the partner sites). However, while this is a nice exercise I do
		recommend, not everyone has the time. This package takes TXT
		files downloaded from the newspaper archive of 'LexisNexis' in
		Since this package takes in TXT files which are unstructured in
		the sense that beginning and end of an article are not clearly
		indicated, the main function lnt_read() relies on certain
		keywords that signal to R where an article begins, ends and
		where meta-data is stored. lnt_checkFiles() thus tests if all
		keywords are in place. Every article in every TXT file should
		start with "X of X DOCUMENTS" and end with "LANGUAGE:". The end
		of the metadata is usually indicated by "LENGTH:". Some
		measures were taken to eliminate problems but where these
		keywords appear inside an article or headline, test1 or test2
		from the lnt_checkFiles() will return FALSE and lnt_read() will
		not be able to do its job. In these cases, it is recommended to
		slightly alter the TXT files, e.g. by changing a headline to
		"language: never stop learning new ones" instead of "LANGUAGE:
		never stop learning new ones"---as "language:" without capital
		letters is not picked up by the functions.
