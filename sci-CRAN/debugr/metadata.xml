		Debug Tool to Watch Objects/Expressions While Running an R Script
		// Tool to print out the value of R objects/expressions while
		running an R script. Outputs can be made dependent on user-
		defined conditions/criteria. Debug messages only appear when a
		global option for debugging is set. This way, 'debugr' code can
		even remain in the debugged code for later use without any
		negative effects during normal runtime.
