		Tools to Manipulate ISA-Tab Files // ISA-Tab
		(Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) tab-delimited (TAB) format) is
		a general purpose framework for storing complex metadata in
		omics applications. It is notoriously hard to manipulate due to
		the fact that it is a graph rather than a tab-delimited data
		frame. The 'isaeditor' package is meant to facilitate reading,
		writing, displaying, manipulating, modifying and populating
		ISA-Tab files in R.
