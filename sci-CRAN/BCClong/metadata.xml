		Bayesian Consensus Clustering for Multiple Longitudinal Features
		// It is very common nowadays for a study to collect multiple
		features and appropriately integrating multiple longitudinal
		features simultaneously for defining individual clusters
		becomes increasingly crucial to understanding population
		heterogeneity and predicting future outcomes.  'BCClong'
		implements a Bayesian consensus clustering (BCC) model for
		multiple longitudinal features via a generalized linear mixed
		model. Compared to existing packages, several key features make
		the 'BCClong' package appealing: (a) it allows simultaneous
		clustering of mixed-type (e.g., continuous, discrete and
		categorical) longitudinal features, (b) it allows each
		longitudinal feature to be collected from different sources
		with measurements taken at distinct sets of time points (known
		as irregularly sampled longitudinal data), (c) it relaxes the
		assumption that all features have the same clustering structure
		by estimating the feature-specific (local) clusterings and
		consensus (global) clustering.
