		Tools for Computation on Batch Systems // As a successor of the
		packages 'BatchJobs' and 'BatchExperiments', this package
		provides a parallel implementation of the Map function for high
		performance computing systems managed by schedulers 'IBM
		Spectrum LSF' (http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/spectrum-
		computing/products/lsf/), 'OpenLava'
		(http://www.openlava.org/), 'Univa Grid Engine'/'Oracle Grid
		Engine' (http://www.univa.com/), 'Slurm'
		(http://slurm.schedmd.com/), 'TORQUE/PBS'
		(http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-
		source/torque/), or 'Docker Swarm'
		(https://docs.docker.com/swarm/). A multicore and socket mode
		allow the parallelization on a local machines, and multiple
		machines can be hooked up via SSH to create a makeshift
		cluster. Moreover, the package provides an abstraction
		mechanism to define large-scale computer experiments in a well-
		organized and reproducible way.
