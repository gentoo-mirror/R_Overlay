		Tools for Computation on Batch Systems // As a successor of the
		packages 'BatchJobs' and 'BatchExperiments', this package
		provides a parallel implementation of the Map function for high
		performance computing systems managed by schedulers 'IBM
		Spectrum LSF' (https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-
		workload-management), 'OpenLava' (http://www.openlava.org/),
		'Univa Grid Engine'/'Oracle Grid Engine'
		(http://www.univa.com/), 'Slurm' (http://slurm.schedmd.com/),
		'TORQUE/PBS' (http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-
		source/torque/), or 'Docker Swarm'
		(https://docs.docker.com/swarm/). A multicore and socket mode
		allow the parallelization on a local machines, and multiple
		machines can be hooked up via SSH to create a makeshift
		cluster. Moreover, the package provides an abstraction
		mechanism to define large-scale computer experiments in a well-
		organized and reproducible way.
