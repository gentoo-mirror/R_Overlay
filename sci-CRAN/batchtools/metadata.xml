		Tools for Computation on Batch Systems // As a successor of the
		packages 'BatchJobs' and 'BatchExperiments', this package
		provides a parallel implementation of the Map function for high
		performance computing systems managed by schedulers 'IBM
		Spectrum LSF' (https://www.ibm.com/products/hpc-workload-
		management), 'Univa Grid Engine'/'Oracle Grid Engine'
		(https://altair.com/hpc-cloud-applications/), 'Slurm'
		(https://slurm.schedmd.com/), 'TORQUE/PBS'
		(https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-
		manager/), or 'Docker Swarm'
		(https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).  A multicore and
		socket mode allow the parallelization on a local machines, and
		multiple machines can be hooked up via SSH to create a
		makeshift cluster. Moreover, the package provides an
		abstraction mechanism to define large-scale computer
		experiments in a well-organized and reproducible way.
