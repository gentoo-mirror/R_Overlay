		Inference on Average Treatment Effects for Continuous Treatments
		// Conduct inference on the sample average treatment effect for
		a matched (observational) dataset with a continuous treatment.
		Equipped with calipered non-bipartite matching, bias-corrected
		sample average treatment effect estimation, and covariate-
		adjusted variance estimation. Matching, estimation, and
		inference methods are described in Frazier, Heng and Zhou
		(2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2409.11701.
