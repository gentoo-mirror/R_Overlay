		'Rcpp' Bindings for the 'fast_float' Header-Only Library for
		Number Parsing // Converting ascii text into (floating-point)
		numeric values is a very common problem. The 'fast_float'
		header-only C++ library by Daniel Lemire does it very well and
		very fast at up to or over to 1 gigabyte per second as
		described in more detail in doi:10.1002/spe.2984. 'fast_float'
		is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and provided here for
		use by other R packages via a simple 'LinkingTo:' statement.
