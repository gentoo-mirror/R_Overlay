		Simple Method to Detect Compositional Changes in Genomic
		Sequences // This software is useful for loading '.fasta' or
		'.gbk' files, and for retrieving sequences from 'GenBank'
		dataset https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/. This package
		allows  to detect differences or asymmetries based on
		nucleotide composition by using local linear kernel smoothers.
		Also, it is possible to draw inference about critical points
		(i. e. maximum or minimum points) related with the derivative
		curves. Additionally, bootstrap methods have been used  for
		estimating confidence intervals and speed computational
		techniques (binning techniques) have been implemented in
		'seq2R'.
