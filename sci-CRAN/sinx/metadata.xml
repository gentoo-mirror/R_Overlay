		Sino Xmen Said // Displays a pseudorandom message from a database
		of quotations. It works as an advanced version of the package
		'fortunes', while 'sinx' supports multi-byte languages such as
		Chinese. The databases of 'sinx' can be given in markdown
		format, which is easier and more friendly than spread sheets
		for users.
