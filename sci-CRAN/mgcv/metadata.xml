		Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness
		Estimation // Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of
		their extensions and other generalized ridge regression with
		multiple smoothing parameter estimation by (Restricted)
		Marginal Likelihood, Generalized Cross Validation and similar,
		or using iterated nested Laplace approximation for fully
		Bayesian inference. See Wood (2017) doi:10.1201/9781315370279
		for an overview. Includes a gam() function, a wide variety of
		smoothers, 'JAGS' support and distributions beyond the
		exponential family.
