		Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood // Bayesian synthetic likelihood
		(BSL, Price et al. (2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882) is
		an alternative to standard, non-parametric approximate Bayesian
		computation (ABC). BSL assumes a multivariate normal
		distribution for the summary statistic likelihood and it is
		suitable when the distribution of the model summary statistics
		is sufficiently regular. This package provides a Metropolis
		Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of BSL,
		BSLasso and semiBSL. BSL with graphical lasso (BSLasso, An et
		al. (2018) https://eprints.qut.edu.au/102263/) is
		computationally more efficient when the dimension of the
		summary statistic is high. A semi-parametric version of BSL
		(semiBSL, An et al. (2018) arXiv:1809.05800) is more robust to
		non-normal summary statistics. Extensions to this package are
		planned.
