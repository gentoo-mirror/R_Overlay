		Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood // Bayesian synthetic likelihood
		(BSL, Price et al. (2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882) is
		an alternative to standard, non-parametric approximate Bayesian
		computation (ABC). BSL assumes a multivariate normal
		distribution for the summary statistic likelihood and it is
		suitable when the distribution of the model summary statistics
		is sufficiently regular. This package provides a Metropolis
		Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of four
		methods (BSL, uBSL, semiBSL and BSLmisspec) and two shrinkage
		estimators (graphical lasso and Warton's estimator). uBSL
		(Price et al. (2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882) uses an
		unbiased estimator to the normal density. A semi-parametric
		version of BSL (semiBSL, An et al. (2018) arXiv:1809.05800) is
		more robust to non-normal summary statistics. BSLmisspec
		(Frazier et al. 2019 arXiv:1904.04551) estimates the Gaussian
		synthetic likelihood whilst acknowledging that there may be
		incompatibility between the model and the observed summary
		statistic. Shrinkage estimation can help to decrease the number
		of model simulations when the dimension of the summary
		statistic is high (e.g., BSLasso, An et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1537928). Extensions to this package
		are planned.
