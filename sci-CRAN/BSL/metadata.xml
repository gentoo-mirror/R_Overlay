		Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood with Graphical Lasso // Bayesian
		synthetic likelihood (BSL, Price et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882) is an alternative to
		standard, non-parametric approximate Bayesian computation
		(ABC). BSL assumes a multivariate normal distribution for the
		summary statistic likelihood and it is suitable when the
		distribution of the model summary statistics is sufficiently
		regular. This package provides a Metropolis Hastings Markov
		chain Monte Carlo implementation of BSL and BSL with graphical
		lasso (BSLasso, An et al. (2018)
		https://eprints.qut.edu.au/102263/), which is computationally
		more efficient when the dimension of the summary statistic is
		high. Extensions to this package are planned.
