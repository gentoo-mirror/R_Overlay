		Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood // Bayesian synthetic likelihood
		(BSL, Price et al. (2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882) is
		an alternative to standard, non-parametric approximate Bayesian
		computation (ABC). BSL assumes a multivariate normal
		distribution for the summary statistic likelihood and it is
		suitable when the distribution of the model summary statistics
		is sufficiently regular. This package provides a Metropolis
		Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of three
		methods (BSL, uBSL and semiBSL) and two shrinkage estimations
		(graphical lasso and Warton's estimation). uBSL (Price et al.
		(2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882) uses an unbiased
		estimator to the normal density. A semi-parametric version of
		BSL (semiBSL, An et al. (2018) arXiv:1809.05800) is more robust
		to non-normal summary statistics. Shrinkage estimations can
		help to bring down the number of simulations when the dimension
		of the summary statistic is high (e.g., BSLasso, An et al.
		(2019) doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1537928). Extensions to this
		package are planned.
