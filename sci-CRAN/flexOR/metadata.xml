		Flexible Odds Ratio Curves // Provides flexible odds ratio curves
		that enable modeling non-linear relationships between
		continuous predictors and binary outcomes. This package
		facilitates a deeper understanding of the impact of each
		continuous predictor on the outcome by presenting results in
		terms of odds ratio (OR) curves based on splines. These curves
		allow for comparison against a specified reference value,
		aiding in the interpretation of the predictor's effect.
