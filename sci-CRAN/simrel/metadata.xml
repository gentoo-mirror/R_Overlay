		Simulation of Multivariate Linear Model Data // Researchers have
		been using simulated data from a multivariate linear model to
		compare and evaluate different methods, ideas and models.
		Additionally, teachers and educators have been using a
		simulation tool to demonstrate and teach various statistical
		and machine learning concepts. This package helps users to
		simulate linear model data with a wide range of properties by
		tuning few parameters such as relevant latent components. In
		addition, a shiny app as an 'RStudio' gadget gives users a
		simple interface for using the simulation function. See more
