		Simulate Forest Resources with the European Forestry Dynamics
		Model // An implementation of European Forestry Dynamics Model
		(EFDM) and an estimation algorithm for the transition
		probabilities. The EFDM is a large-scale forest model that
		simulates the development of the forest and estimates volume of
		wood harvested for any given forested area. This estimate can
		be broken down by, for example, species, site quality,
		management regime and ownership category. See Packalen et al.
