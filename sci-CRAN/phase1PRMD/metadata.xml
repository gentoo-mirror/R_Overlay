		Personalized Repeated Measurement Design for Phase I Clinical
		Trials // Implements Bayesian phase I repeated measurement
		design that accounts for multidimensional toxicity endpoints
		and longitudinal efficacy measure from multiple treatment
		cycles. The package provides flags to fit a variety of model-
		based phase I design, including 1 stage models with or without
		individualized dose modification, 3-stage models with or
		without individualized dose modification, etc. Functions are
		provided to recommend dosage selection based on the data
		collected in the available patient cohorts and to simulate
		trial characteristics given design parameters. Yin, Jun, et al.
