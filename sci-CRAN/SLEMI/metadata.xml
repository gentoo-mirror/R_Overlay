		Statistical Learning Based Estimation of Mutual Information //
		The implementation of the algorithm for estimation of mutual
		information and channel capacity from experimental data by
		classification procedures (logistic regression). Technically,
		it allows to estimate information-theoretic measures between
		finite-state input and multivariate, continuous output. Method
		described in Jetka et al. (2019)
