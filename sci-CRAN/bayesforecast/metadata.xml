		Bayesian Time Series Modeling with Stan // Fit Bayesian time
		series models using 'Stan' for full Bayesian inference. A wide
		range of distributions and models are supported, allowing users
		to fit Seasonal ARIMA, ARIMAX, Dynamic Harmonic Regression,
		GARCH, t-student innovation GARCH models, asymmetric GARCH,
		Random Walks, stochastic volatility models for univariate time
		series.  Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly
		encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually
		reflect their beliefs. Model fit can easily be assessed and
		compared with typical visualization methods, information
		criteria such as loglik, AIC, BIC WAIC, Bayes factor and leave-
		one-out cross-validation methods. References: Hyndman (2017)
