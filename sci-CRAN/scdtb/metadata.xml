		Single Case Design Tools // In some situations where researchers
		would like to demonstrate causal effects, it is hard to obtain
		a sample size that would allow for a well-powered randomized
		controlled trial. Single case designs are experimental designs
		that can be used to demonstrate causal effects with only one
		participant or with only a few participants. The 'scdtb'
		package provides a suite of tools for analyzing data from
		studies that use single case designs. The nap() function can be
		used to compute the nonoverlap of all pairs as outlined by the
		What Works Clearinghouse (2022)
		https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/Handbooks. The package also offers
		the mixed_model_analysis() and cross_lagged() functions which
		implement mixed effects models and cross lagged analyses as
		described in Maric  van der Werff (2020)
		doi:10.4324/9780429273872-9. The randomization_test() function
		implements randomization tests based on methods presented in
		Onghena (2020) doi:10.4324/9780429273872-8. The scdtb() 'shiny'
		application can be used to upload single case design data and
		access various 'scdtb' tools for plotting and analysis.
