		Time-Frequency Analysis of 1-D Signals // A set of R functions
		which provide an environment for the Time-Frequency analysis of
		1-D signals (and especially for the wavelet and Gabor
		transforms of noisy signals). It was originally written for
		Splus by Rene Carmona, Bruno Torresani, and Wen L. Hwang, first
		at the University of California at Irvine and then at Princeton
		University.  Credit should also be given to Andrea Wang whose
		functions on the dyadic wavelet transform are included. Rwave
		is based on the book: "Practical Time-Frequency Analysis: Gabor
		and Wavelet Transforms with an Implementation in S", by Rene
		Carmona, Wen L. Hwang and Bruno Torresani (1998, eBook
		ISBN:978008053942), Academic Press.
