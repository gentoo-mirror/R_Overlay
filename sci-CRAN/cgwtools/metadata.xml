		observations or evaluations of data, including a variety of
		ways to list objects by size, class, etc. In addition,
		functions which mimic Unix shell commands, including 'head',
		'tail' ,'pushd' ,and 'popd'. The functions 'seqle' and
		'reverse.seqle' mimic the base 'rle' but can search for linear
		sequences. The function 'splatnd' allows the user to generate
		zero-argument commands without the need for 'makeActiveBinding'
