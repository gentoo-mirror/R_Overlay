		Continuous-Time Competing Risks Estimation using Targeted Minimum
		Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE) // One-step continuous-time
		Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE) for outcome-
		specific absolute risk estimands in right-censored survival
		settings with or without competing risks, implementing the
		methodology described in Rytgaard et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1111/biom.13856 and Rytgaard and van der Laan (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s10985-022-09576-2. Currently 'concrete' can be
		used to estimate the effects of static or dynamic interventions
		on binary treatments given at baseline, cross-validated initial
		estimation of treatment propensity is done using the
		'SuperLearner' package, and initial estimation of conditional
		hazards is done using ensembles of Cox regressions from the
		'survival' package or Coxnet from the 'glmnet' package.
