		Real-Time PCR Data Sets by Karlen et al. (2007) // Real-time
		quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data sets by
		Karlen et al. (2007) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-8-131. Provides one
		single tabular tidy data set in long format, encompassing 32
		dilution series, for seven PCR targets and four biological
		samples. The targeted amplicons are within the murine genes:
		Cav1, Ccn2, Eln, Fn1, Rpl27, Hspg2, and Serpine1, respectively.
		Dilution series: scheme 1 (Cav1, Eln, Hspg2, Serpine1): 1-fold,
		10-fold, 50-fold, and 100-fold; scheme 2 (Ccn2, Rpl27, Fn1):
		1-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold and 1000-fold. For each
		concentration there are five replicates, except for the
		1000-fold concentration, where only two replicates were
		performed. Each amplification curve is 40 cycles long. Original
		raw data file is Additional file 2 from "Statistical
		significance of quantitative PCR" by Y. Karlen, A. McNair, S.
		Perseguers, C. Mazza, and N. Mermod (2007) https://static-conte
