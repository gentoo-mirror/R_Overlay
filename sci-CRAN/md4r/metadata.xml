		Markdown Parser Implemented using the 'MD4C' Library // Provides
		an R wrapper for the 'MD4C' (Markdown for 'C') library.
		Functions exist for parsing markdown ('CommonMark' compliant)
		along with support for other common markdown extensions (e.g.
		GitHub flavored markdown, 'LaTeX' equation support, etc.). The
		package also provides a number of higher level functions for
		exploring and manipulating markdown abstract syntax trees as
		well as translating and displaying the documents.
