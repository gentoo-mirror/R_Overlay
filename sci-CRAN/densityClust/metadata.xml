		Clustering by Fast Search and Find of Density Peaks // An
		improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of the
		density peak clustering algorithm, originally described by Alex
		Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344). It can
		handle large datasets ( 100,000 samples) very efficiently. It
		was initially implemented by Thomas Lin Pedersen, with inputs
		from Sean Hughes and later improved by Xiaojie Qiu to handle
		large datasets with kNNs.
