		Builds Chronologies from Oxygen Isotope Profiles in Shells //
		Takes as input a stable oxygen isotope (d18O) profile measured
		in growth direction (D) through a shell + uncertainties in both
		variables (d18O_err  D_err). It then models the seasonality in
		the d18O record by fitting a combination of a growth and
		temperature sine wave to year-length chunks of the data (see
		Judd et al., (2018) doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.09.034). This
		modelling is carried out along a sliding window through the
		data and yields estimates of the day of the year (Julian Day)
		and local growth rate for each data point. Uncertainties in
		both modelling routine and the data itself are propagated and
		pooled to obtain a confidence envelope around the age of each
		data point in the shell. The end result is a shell chronology
		consisting of estimated ages of shell formation relative to the
		annual cycle with their uncertainties. All formulae in the
		package serve this purpose, but the user can customize the
		model (e.g. number of days in a year and the mineralogy of the
		shell carbonate) through input parameters.
