		Generate Instance Space Based on Scagnostics // Generate
		bivariate data based on scatterplot features defined through
		scagnostics. Scagnostics is an exploratory graphical tool that
		defines nine features of a scatterplot based on the
		characteristics of three geometric graphs defined on the
		scatterplot. The exact calculation of these measurements are
		based on Wilkinson, L., Anand, A.,  Grossman, R. (2005)
		doi:10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532142. Set the required values for
		the scagnostic measurement type and the number of points that
		are needed to generate a bivariate dataset that gives the
		expected scagnostic measurements.
