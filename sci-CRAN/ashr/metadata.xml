		Methods for Adaptive Shrinkage, using Empirical Bayes // The R
		package 'ashr' implements an Empirical Bayes approach for
		large-scale hypothesis testing and false discovery rate (FDR)
		estimation based on the methods proposed in M. Stephens, 2016,
		"False discovery rates: a new deal",
		DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041. These methods can be applied
		whenever two sets of summary statistics---estimated effects and
		standard errors---are available, just as 'qvalue' can be
		applied to previously computed p-values. Two main interfaces
		are provided: ash(), which is more user-friendly; and
		ash.workhorse(), which has more options and is geared toward
		advanced users. The ash() and ash.workhorse() also provides a
		flexible modeling interface that can accommodate a variety of
		likelihoods (e.g., normal, Poisson) and mixture priors (e.g.,
		uniform, normal).
