		Utilities for Handling Strings and Text // Utilities for handling
		character vectors that store human-readable text (either plain
		or with markup, such as HTML or LaTeX). The package provides,
		in particular, functions that help with the preparation of
		plain-text reports, e.g. for expanding and aligning strings
		that form the lines of such reports. The package also provides
		generic functions for transforming R objects to HTML and to
		plain text.
