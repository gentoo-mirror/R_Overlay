		Network-Based Communities and Kernel Machine Methods // Analysis
		of network community objects with applications to neuroimaging
		data. There are two main components to this package. The first
		is the hierarchical multimodal spinglass (HMS) algorithm, which
		is a novel community detection algorithm specifically tailored
		to the unique issues within brain connectivity. The other is a
		suite of semiparametric kernel machine methods that allow for
		statistical inference to be performed to test for potential
		associations between these community structures and an outcome
		of interest (binary or continuous).
