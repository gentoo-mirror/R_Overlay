		Multiverse Analysis of Multinomial Processing Tree Models //
		Statistical or cognitive modeling usually requires a number of
		more or less arbitrary choices creating one specific path
		through a 'garden of forking paths'. The multiverse approach
		(Steegen, Tuerlinckx, Gelman,  Vanpaemel, 2016,
		doi:10.1177/1745691616658637) offers a principled alternative
		in which results for all possible combinations of reasonable
		modeling choices are reported. MPTmultiverse performs a
		multiverse analysis for multinomial processing tree (MPT,
		Riefer  Batchelder, 1988, doi:10.1037/0033-295X.95.3.318)
		models combining maximum-likelihood/frequentist and Bayesian
		estimation approaches with different levels of pooling (i.e.,
		data aggregation). For the frequentist approaches, no pooling
		(with and without parametric or nonparametric bootstrap) and
		complete pooling are implemented using MPTinR
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=MPTinR. For the Bayesian
		approaches, no pooling, complete pooling, and three different
		variants of partial pooling are implemented using TreeBUGS
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=TreeBUGS. The main function
		is fit_mpt() who performs the multiverse analysis in one call.
