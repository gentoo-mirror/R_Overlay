		Ensemble Boolean Model Biomarker Analysis // Analysis and
		visualization of an ensemble of boolean models for biomarker
		discovery in cancer cell networks. The package allows to easily
		import the data results of a software pipeline that predicts
		synergistic drug combinations in cancer cell lines, developed
		by the DrugLogics research group in NTNU. It has generic
		functions that can be used to split a boolean model dataset to
		model groups with regards to the models predictive performance
		(number of true positive predictions or Matthews correlation
		coefficient score) or synergy prediction based on a given set
		of observed synergies and find the average activity difference
		per network node between all group pairs. Thus, given user-
		specific thresholds, important nodes (biomarkers) can be
		accessed in the sense that they make the models predict
		specific synergies (synergy biomarkers) or have better
		performance in general (performance biomarkers). Lastly, if the
		boolean models have a specific equation form and differ only in
		their link operator, link operator biomarkers can also be
		assessed.
