		Automatic Phenotyping of Electronic Health Record at Visit
		Resolution // Using Electronic Health Record (EHR) is difficult
		because most of the time the true characteristic of the patient
		is not available. Instead we can retrieve the International
		Classification of Disease code related to the disease of
		interest or we can count the occurrence of the Unified Medical
		Language System. None of them is the true phenotype which needs
		chart review to identify. However chart review is time
		consuming and costly. 'PheVis' is an algorithm which is
		phenotyping (i.e identify a characteristic) at the visit level
		in an unsupervised fashion. It can be used for chronic or acute
		diseases. An example of how to use 'PheVis' is available in the
		vignette. Basically there are two functions that are to be
		used: `train_phevis()` which trains the algorithm and
		`test_phevis()` which get the predicted probabilities. The
		detailed method is described in preprint by Fert et al. (2020)
