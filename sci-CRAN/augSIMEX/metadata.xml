		Analysis of Data with Mixed Measurement Error and
		Misclassification in Covariates // Implementation of the
		augmented Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) algorithm proposed
		by Yi et al. (2015) doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.922777 for
		analyzing the data with mixed measurement error and
		misclassification. The main function provides a similar summary
		output as that of glm() function. Both parametric and empirical
		SIMEX are considered in the package.
