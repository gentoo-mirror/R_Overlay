		A Generalized Multiclass Support Vector Machine // The GenSVM
		classifier is a generalized multiclass support vector machine
		(SVM). This classifier aims to find decision boundaries that
		separate the classes with as wide a margin as possible. In
		GenSVM, the loss function is very flexible in the way that
		misclassifications are penalized.  This allows the user to tune
		the classifier to the dataset at hand and potentially obtain
		higher classification accuracy than alternative multiclass
		SVMs.  Moreover, this flexibility means that GenSVM has a
		number of other multiclass SVMs as special cases. One of the
		other advantages of GenSVM is that it is trained in the primal
		space, allowing the use of warm starts during optimization.
		This means that for common tasks such as cross validation or
		repeated model fitting, GenSVM can be trained very quickly.
