		Approximate Bayesian Computations for Phylogenetic Comparative
		Methods // Fits by ABC, the parameters of a stochastic process
		modelling the phylogeny and evolution of a suite of traits
		following the tree. The user may define an arbitrary Markov
		process for the trait and phylogeny. Importantly, trait-
		dependent speciation models are handled and fitted to data. See
		K. Bartoszek, P. Lio' (2019) 10.5506/APhysPolBSupp.12.25. The
		suggested geiger package can be obtained from CRAN's archive
		https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/geiger/,
		suggested to take latest version. Otherwise its required code
		is present in the pcmabc package. The suggested distory package
		can be obtained from CRAN's archive
		https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/distory/,
		suggested to take latest version. Both distory and geiger are
		orphaned at the moment.
