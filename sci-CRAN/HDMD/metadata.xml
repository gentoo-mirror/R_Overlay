		Statistical Analysis Tools for High Dimension Molecular Data
		(HDMD) // High Dimensional Molecular Data (HDMD) typically have
		many more variables or dimensions than observations or
		replicates (DN).  This can cause many statistical procedures to
		fail, become intractable, or produce misleading results.  This
		package provides several tools to reduce dimensionality and
		analyze biological data for meaningful interpretation of
		results. Factor Analysis (FA), Principal Components Analysis
		(PCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) are frequently used
		multivariate techniques.  However, PCA methods prcomp and
		princomp do not reflect the proportion of total variation of
		each principal component.  Loadings.variation displays the
		relative and cumulative contribution of variation for each
		component by accounting for all variability in data. When DN,
		the maximum likelihood method cannot be applied in FA and the
		the principal axes method must be used instead, as in factor.pa
		of the psych package. The factor.pa.ginv function in this
		package further allows for a singular covariance matrix by
		applying a general inverse method to estimate factor scores.
		Moreover, factor.pa.ginv removes and warns of any variables
		that are constant, which would otherwise create an invalid
		covariance matrix. Promax.only further allows users to define
		rotation parameters during factor estimation.  Similar to the
		Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance estimates the
		relationship among groups.  pairwise.mahalanobis computes all
		such pairwise Mahalanobis distances among groups and is useful
		for quantifying the separation of groups in DA. Genetic
		sequences are composed of discrete alphabetic characters, which
		makes estimates of variability difficult.  MolecularEntropy and
		MolecularMI calculate the entropy and mutual information to
		estimate variability and covariability, respectively, of DNA or
		Amino Acid sequences.  Functional grouping of amino acids
		(Atchley et al 1999) is also available for entropy and mutual
		information estimation.  Mutual information values can be
		normalized by NMI to account for the background distribution
		arising from the stochastic pairing of independent, random
		sites. Alternatively, discrete alphabetic sequences can be
		transformed into biologically informative metrics to be used in
		various multivariate procedures.  FactorTransform converts
		amino acid sequences using the amino acid indices determined by
		Atchley et al 2005.
