		A Hybrid Spatial Model for Capturing Spatially Varying
		Relationships Between Variables in the Data // It is a hybrid
		spatial model that combines the strength of two widely used
		regression models, MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression
		Splines) and GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) to
		provide an effective approach for predicting a response
		variable at unknown locations. The MARS model is used in the
		first step of the development of a hybrid model to identify the
		most important predictor variables that assist in predicting
		the response variable. For method details see, Friedman, J.H.
		(1991). DOI:10.1214/aos/1176347963.The GWR model is then used
		to predict the response variable at testing locations based on
		these selected variables that account for spatial variations in
		the relationships between the variables. This hybrid model can
		improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to using an
		individual model alone.This developed hybrid spatial model can
		be useful particularly in cases where the relationship between
		the response variable and predictor variables is complex and
		non-linear, and varies across locations.
