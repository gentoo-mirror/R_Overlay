		Statistical Inference for Mixed Traces of DNA (Lite-Version) //
		Statistical methods for DNA mixture analysis. This package is a
		lite-version of the 'DNAmixtures' package to allow users
		without a 'HUGIN' software license to experiment with the
		statistical methodology. While the lite-version aims to provide
		the full functionality it is noticeably less efficient than the
		original 'DNAmixtures' package. For details on implementation
		and methodology see https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/.
