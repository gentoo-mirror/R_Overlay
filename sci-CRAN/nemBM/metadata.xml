		Using Network Evolution Models to Generate Networks with Selected
		Blockmodel Type // To study network evolution models and
		different blockmodeling approaches. Various functions enable
		generating (temporal) networks with a selected blockmodel type,
		taking into account selected local network mechanisms. The
		development of this package is financially supported the
		Slovenian Research Agency (www.arrs.gov.si) within the research
		program P5960168 and the research project J5-2557 (Comparison
		and evaluation of different approaches to blockmodeling dynamic
		networks by simulations with application to Slovenian co-
		authorship networks).
