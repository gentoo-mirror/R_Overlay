		Using Network Evolution Models to Generate Networks with Selected
		Blockmodel Type // To study network evolution models and
		different blockmodeling approaches. Various functions enable
		generating (temporal) networks with a selected blockmodel type,
		taking into account selected local network mechanisms. The
		development of this package is financially supported by the
		Slovenian Research Agency (www.arrs.gov.si) within the research
		programs P5-0168 and the research project J7-8279
		(Blockmodeling multilevel and temporal networks).
