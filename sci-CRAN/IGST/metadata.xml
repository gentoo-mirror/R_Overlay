		Informative Gene Selection Tool // Mining informative genes with
		certain biological meanings are important for clinical
		diagnosis of disease and discovery of disease mechanisms in
		plants and animals. This process involves identification of
		relevant genes and removal of redundant genes as much as
		possible from a whole gene set. This package selects the
		informative genes related to a specific trait using gene
		expression dataset. These trait specific genes are considered
		as informative genes. This package returns the informative gene
		set from the high dimensional gene expression data using a
		combination of methods SVM and MRMR (for feature selection)
		with bootstrapping procedure.
