		Generalized Price and Quantity Indexes // A small package for
		calculating lots of different price indexes, and by extension
		quantity indexes. Provides tools to build and work with any
		type of bilateral generalized-mean index (of which most price
		indexes are), along with a few important indexes that don't
		belong to the generalized-mean family. Implements and extends
		many of the methods in Balk (2008, ISBN:978-1-107-40496-0) and
		ILO, IMF, OECD, Eurostat, UN, and World Bank (2020,
		ISBN:978-1-51354-298-0) for bilateral price indexes.
