		A Flexible Container to Transport and Manipulate Data and
		Associated Resources // Provides a flexible container to
		transport and manipulate complex sets of data. These data may
		consist of multiple data files and associated meta data and
		ancillary files. Individual data objects have associated system
		level meta data, and data files are linked together using the
		OAI-ORE standard resource map which describes the relationships
		between the files. The OAI-ORE standard is described at
		https://www.openarchives.org/ore. Data packages can be
		serialized and transported as structured files that have been
		created following the BagIt specification. The BagIt
		specification is described at https://tools.ietf.org/html
		/draft-kunze-bagit-08.
