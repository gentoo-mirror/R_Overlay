		Generate RNA-Seq Data from Gene-Gene Association Networks //
		Methods to generate random gene-gene association networks and
		simulate RNA-seq data from them. Includes functions to generate
		random networks of any size and perturb them to obtain
		differential networks. Network objects are built from
		individual, overlapping modules that represent pathways. The
		resulting network has various topological properties that are
		characteristic of gene regulatory networks. RNA-seq data can be
		generated such that the association among gene expression
		profiles reflect the underlying network. A reference RNA-seq
		dataset can be provided to model realistic marginal
		distributions. Plotting functions are available to visualize a
		network, compare two networks, and compare the expression of
		two genes across multiple networks.
