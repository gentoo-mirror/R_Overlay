		Types and Features for Object Oriented Programming // Construct
		message-passing style objects with types and features. Q7 types
		uses composition instead of inheritance in creating derived
		types, allowing defining any code segment as feature and
		associating any feature to any object. Compared to R6, Q7 is
		simpler and more flexible, and is more friendly in syntax.
