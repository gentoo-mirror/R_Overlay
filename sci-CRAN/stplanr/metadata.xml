		Sustainable Transport Planning // Tools for transport planning
		with an emphasis on spatial transport data and non-motorized
		modes. Enables common transport planning tasks including:
		downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating
		geographic "desire lines" from origin-destination (OD) data;
		route assignment, locally and via interfaces to routing
		services such as https://cyclestreets.net/ and calculation of
		route segment attributes such as bearing. The package
		implements the 'travel flow aggregration' method described in
		Morgan and Lovelace (2020) doi:10.1177/2399808320942779.
		Further information on the package's aim and scope can be found
		in the vignettes and in a paper in the R Journal (Lovelace and
		Ellison 2018) doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053.
