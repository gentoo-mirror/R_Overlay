		with an emphasis on spatial transport data and non-motorized
		modes. Enables common transport planning tasks including:
		downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating
		geographic "desire lines" from origin-destination (OD) data;
		route assignment, locally and via interfaces to routing
		services such as http://cyclestreets.net/; calculation of route
		segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate flow; and
		'travel watershed' analysis. See Lovelace and Ellison (2018)
