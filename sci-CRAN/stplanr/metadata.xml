		Sustainable Transport Planning // Tools for transport planning
		with an emphasis on spatial transport data and non-motorized
		modes. Create geographic "desire lines" from origin-destination
		(OD) data (building on the 'od' package); calculate routes on
		the transport network locally and via interfaces to routing
		services such as https://cyclestreets.net/; calculate route
		segment attributes such as bearing.  The package implements the
		'travel flow aggregration' method described in Morgan and
		Lovelace (2020) doi:10.1177/2399808320942779.  Further
		information on the package's aim and scope can be found in the
		vignettes and in a paper in the R Journal (Lovelace and Ellison
		2018) doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053.
