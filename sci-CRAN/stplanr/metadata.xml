		Sustainable Transport Planning // Tools for transport planning
		with an emphasis on spatial transport data and non-motorized
		modes. The package was originally developed to support the
		'Propensity to Cycle Tool', a publicly available strategic
		cycle network planning tool (Lovelace et al. 2017)
		doi:10.5198/jtlu.2016.862, but has since been extended to
		support public transport routing and accessibility analysis
		(Moreno-Monroy et al. 2017) doi:10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.08.012
		and routing with locally hosted routing engines such as 'OSRM'
		(Lowans et al. 2023) doi:10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117337. The
		main functions are for creating and manipulating geographic
		"desire lines" from origin-destination (OD) data (building on
		the 'od' package); calculating routes on the transport network
		locally and via interfaces to routing services such as
		https://cyclestreets.net/ (Desjardins et al. 2021)
		doi:10.1007/s11116-021-10197-1; and calculating route segment
		attributes such as bearing. The package implements the 'travel
		flow aggregration' method described in Morgan and Lovelace
		(2020) doi:10.1177/2399808320942779 and the 'OD jittering'
		method described in Lovelace et al. (2022)
		doi:10.32866/001c.33873. Further information on the package's
		aim and scope can be found in the vignettes and in a paper in
		the R Journal (Lovelace and Ellison 2018)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053, and in a paper outlining the
		landscape of open source software for geographic methods in
		transport planning (Lovelace, 2021)
		doi:10.1007/s10109-020-00342-2.
