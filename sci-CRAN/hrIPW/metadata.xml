		Hazard Ratio Estimation using Cox Model Weighted by the Estimated
		Propensity Score // Estimates the log hazard ratio associated
		with a binary exposure using a Cox PH model weighted by the
		propensity score. Propensity model is estimated using a simple
		logistic regression. Variance estimation takes into account the
		propensity score estimation step with the method proposed by
		Hajage et al. (2018) doi:10.1002/bimj.201700330. Both the
		average treatment effect on the overall (ATE) or the treated
		(ATT) population can be estimated. For the ATE estimation, both
		unstabilized and stabilized weights can be used.
