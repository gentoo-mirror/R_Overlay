		Language to Manage Many Models // A system for describing and
		manipulating the many models that are generated in causal
		inference and data analysis projects, as based on the causal
		theory and criteria of Austin Bradford Hill (1965)
		doi:10.1177/003591576505800503. This system includes the
		addition of formal attributes that modify base `R` objects,
		including terms and formulas, with a focus on variable roles in
		the "do-calculus" of modeling, as described in Pearl (2010)
		doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1203. For example, the definition of
		exposure, outcome, and interaction are  implicit in the roles
		variables take in a formula. These premises allow for a more
		fluent modeling approach focusing on variable relationships,
		and assessing effect modification, as described by VanderWeele
		and Robins (2007) doi:10.1097/EDE.0b013e318127181b. The
		essential goal is to help contextualize formulas and models in
		causality-oriented workflows.
