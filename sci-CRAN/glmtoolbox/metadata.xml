		Set of Tools to Data Analysis using Generalized Linear Models //
		Set of tools to the statistical analysis of data using: (1)
		normal linear models; (2) generalized linear models; (3)
		negative binomial regression models as alternative to the
		Poisson regression models under the presence of overdispersion;
		(4) beta-binomial and random-clumped binomial regression models
		as alternative to the binomial regression models under the
		presence of overdispersion; (5) Zero-inflated and zero-altered
		regression models to deal with zero-excess in count data; (6)
		generalized estimating equations for cluster correlated data.
