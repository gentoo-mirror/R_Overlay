		Hilbert Similarity Index for High Dimensional Data // Quantifying
		similarity between high-dimensional single cell samples is
		challenging, and usually requires some simplifying hypothesis
		to be made. By transforming the high dimensional space into a
		high dimensional grid, the number of cells in each sub-space of
		the grid is characteristic of a given sample. Using a Hilbert
		curve each sample can be visualized as a simple density plot,
		and the distance between samples can be calculated from the
		distribution of cells using the Jensen-Shannon distance. Bins
		that correspond to significant differences between samples can
		identified using a simple bootstrap procedure.
