		Ecological and Biogeographical Null Model Tests for Comparing
		Rarefaction Curves // Randomization tests for the statistical
		comparison of i = two or more individual-based, sample-based or
		coverage-based rarefaction curves. The ecological null
		hypothesis is that the i samples were all drawn randomly from a
		single assemblage, with (necessarily) a single underlying
		species abundance distribution. The biogeographic null
		hypothesis is that the i samples were all drawn from different
		assemblages that, nonetheless, share similar species richness
		and species abundance distributions. Functions are described in
