		A Simulation-Based Workflow to Design and Evaluate Choice-Based
		Conjoint Survey Experiments // A simulation-based workflow to
		design and evaluate choice-based conjoint survey experiments.
		Generate a variety of survey designs, including full factorial
		designs, orthogonal designs, and Bayesian D-efficient designs
		as well as designs with "no choice" options and "labeled" (also
		known as "alternative specific") designs. Full factorial and
		orthogonal designs are obtained using the 'DoE.base' package
		(Grmping, 2018) doi:10.18637/jss.v085.i05. Bayesian D-efficient
		designs are obtained using the 'idefix' package (Traets et al,
		2020) doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i03. Conveniently inspect the
		design balance and overlap, and simulate choice data for a
		survey design either randomly or according to a multinomial or
		mixed logit utility model defined by user-provided prior
		parameters. Conduct a power analysis for a given survey design
		by estimating the same model on different subsets of the data
		to simulate different sample sizes. Choice simulation and model
		estimation in power analyses are handled using the 'logitr'
		package (Helveston, 2023) doi:10.18637/jss.v105.i10.
