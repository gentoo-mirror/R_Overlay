		Design and Evaluate Choice-Based Conjoint Survey Experiments //
		Design and evaluate choice-based conjoint survey experiments in
		R. Generate survey designs, including randomized designs and
		Bayesian D-efficient designs as well as designs with "no
		choice" options and labeled designs. Conveniently inspect the
		design balance and overlap, and simulate choice data for a
		survey design either randomly or according to a multinomial or
		mixed logit utility model defined by user-provided prior
		parameters. Conduct power analyses on a survey design by
		estimating the same model multiple times using different
		subsets of the data to simulate different sample sizes. Choice
		simulation and model estimation are handled using the 'logitr'
		package, and Bayesian D-efficient designs are obtained using
		the 'idefix' package. For more details see Helveston (2023)
