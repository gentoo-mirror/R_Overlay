		Sample and Precomputed Data for Use with 'exams.forge' //
		Provides a small collection of datasets supporting Pearson
		correlation and linear regression analysis. It includes the
		precomputed dataset 'sos100', with integer values summing to
		zero and squared sum equal to 100. For other values of 'n' and
		user-defined parameters, the 'sos()' function from the
		'exams.forge' package can be used to generate datasets on the
		fly. In addition, the package contains around 500 R Markdown
		exercises that illustrate the usage of 'exams.forge' commands.
