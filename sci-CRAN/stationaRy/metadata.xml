		Detailed Meteorological Data from Stations All Over the World //
		Acquire hourly meteorological data from stations located all
		over the world. There is a wealth of data available, with
		historic weather data accessible from nearly 30,000 stations.
		The available data is automatically downloaded from a data
		repository and processed into a 'tibble' for the exact range of
		years requested. A relative humidity approximation is provided
		using the 'August-Roche-Magnus' formula, which was adapted from
		Alduchov and Eskridge (1996) doi:10.1175%2F1520-0450%281996%290
