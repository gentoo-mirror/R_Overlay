		Tools for Analyzing Shapes and Patterns // This is (1) An
		evolving and growing collection of tools for the
		quantification, assessment, and comparison of shape and
		pattern. The spatial decomposition of planar shapes using
		'ShrinkShape' to incrementally shrink shapes to extinction
		while computing area, perimeter, and number of parts at each
		iteration of shrinking. The spectra of results are returned in
		graphic and tabular formats. Additional utility tools for
		handling data are provided and this package will be added to as
		more tools are created, cleaned-up, and documented. (2)
		Provision of tools for estimating composition and configuration
		parameters from a categorical (binary) landscape map (grid) and
		then simulates a selected number of statistically similar
		landscapes. Class-focused pattern metrics are computed for each
		simulated map to produce empirical distributions against which
		statistical comparisons can be made. The code permits the
		analysis of single maps or pairs of maps. Current limitation is
		for binary (classes 1, 2) maps that are 64x64 cells in extent.
		(3) Counting the number of each first-order pattern element and
		converting that information into both frequency and probability
		vectors. See Remmel (2018) doi:10.3390/su10103413 and Remmel
		and Fortin (2013) doi:10.1007/s10980-013-9905-x. NOTE: This is
		a consolidation of existing packages ('PatternClass',
		'ShapePattern') to begin warehousing all shape and pattern code
		in a common package. Note that all future developments will
		appear in this package and that 'PatternClass' will eventually
		be archived.
