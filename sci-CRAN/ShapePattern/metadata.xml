		Tools for Analyzing Shapes and Patterns // This is an evolving
		and growing collection of tools for the quantification,
		assessment, and comparison of shape and pattern. This
		collection provides tools for: (1) the spatial decomposition of
		planar shapes using 'ShrinkShape' to incrementally shrink
		shapes to extinction while computing area, perimeter, and
		number of parts at each iteration of shrinking; the spectra of
		results are returned in graphic and tabular formats (Remmel
		2015) doi:10.1111/cag.12222, (2) simulating landscape patterns,
		(3) provision of tools for estimating composition and
		configuration parameters from a categorical (binary) landscape
		map (grid) and then simulates a selected number of
		statistically similar landscapes. Class-focused pattern metrics
		are computed for each simulated map to produce empirical
		distributions against which statistical comparisons can be
		made. The code permits the analysis of single maps or pairs of
		maps (Remmel and Fortin 2013) doi:10.1007/s10980-013-9905-x,
		(4) counting the number of each first-order pattern element and
		converting that information into both frequency and empirical
		probability vectors (Remmel 2020) doi:10.3390/e22040420, and
		(5) computing the porosity of raster patches
		doi:10.3390/su10103413. NOTE: This is a consolidation of
		existing packages ('PatternClass', 'ShapePattern') to begin
		warehousing all shape and pattern code in a common package.
		Additional utility tools for handling data are provided and
		this package will be added to as more tools are created,
		cleaned-up, and documented.  Note that all future developments
		will appear in this package and that 'PatternClass' will
		eventually be archived.
