		Doubly Robust Inference for Cox Marginal Structural Model with
		Informative Censoring // Doubly robust estimation and inference
		of log hazard ratio under the Cox marginal structural model
		with informative censoring. An augmented inverse probability
		weighted estimator that involves 3 working models, one for
		conditional failure time T, one for conditional censoring time
		C and one for propensity score. Both models for T and C can
		depend on both a binary treatment A and additional baseline
		covariates Z, while the propensity score model only depends on
		Z. With the help of cross-fitting techniques, achieves the
		rate-doubly robust property that allows the use of most machine
		learning or non-parametric methods for all 3 working models,
		which are not permitted in classic inverse probability
		weighting or doubly robust estimators. When the proportional
		hazard assumption is violated, CoxAIPW estimates a causal
		estimated that is a weighted average of the time-varying log
		hazard ratio. Reference: Luo, J. (2023). Statistical Robustness
