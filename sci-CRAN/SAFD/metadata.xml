		Statistical Analysis of Fuzzy Data // The aim of the package is
		to provide some basic functions for doing statistics with one
		dimensional Fuzzy Data (in the form of polygonal fuzzy
		numbers). In particular, the package contains functions for the
		basic operations on the class of fuzzy numbers (sum, scalar
		product, mean, median, Hukuhara difference) as well as for
		calculating (Bertoluzza) distance and sample variance. Moreover
		a function to simulate fuzzy random variables and bootstrap
		tests for the equality of means is included. Version 2.1 fixes
		some bugs of previous versions.
