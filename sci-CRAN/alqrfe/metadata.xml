		Adaptive Lasso Quantile Regression with Fixed Effects // Quantile
		regression with fixed effects solves longitudinal data,
		considering the individual intercepts as fixed effects. The
		parametric set of this type of problem used to be huge. Thus
		penalized methods such as Lasso are currently applied. Adaptive
		Lasso presents oracle proprieties, which include Gaussianity
		and correct model selection. Bayesian information criteria
		(BIC) estimates the optimal tuning parameter lambda. Plot tools
		are also available.
