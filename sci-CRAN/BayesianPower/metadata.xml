		Sample Size and Power for Comparing Inequality Constrained
		Hypotheses // A collection of methods to determine the required
		sample size for the evaluation of inequality constrained
		hypotheses by means of a Bayes factor. Alternatively, for a
		given sample size, the unconditional error probabilities or the
		expected conditional error probabilities can be determined.
		Additional material on the methods in this package is available
		in Klaassen, F., Hoijtink, H.  Gu, X. (2019)
