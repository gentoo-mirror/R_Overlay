		Visual and Non-Visual Spectral Analysis of Light // Analyse light
		spectra for visual and non-visual (often called melanopic)
		needs, wrapped up in a Shiny App. 'Spectran' allows for the
		import of spectra in various CSV forms but also provides a wide
		range of example spectra and even the creation of own spectral
		power distributions. The goal of the app is to provide easy
		access and a visual overview of the spectral calculations
		underlying common parameters used in the field. It is thus
		ideal for educational purposes or the creation of presentation
		ready graphs in lighting research and application. 'Spectran'
		uses equations and action spectra described in CIE S026 (2018)
		doi:10.25039/S026.2018, DIN/TS 5031-100 (2021)
		doi:10.31030/3287213, and ISO/CIE 23539 (2023)
		doi:10.25039/IS0.CIE.23539.2023.
