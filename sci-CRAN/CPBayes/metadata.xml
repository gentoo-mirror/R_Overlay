		Bayesian Meta Analysis for Studying Cross-Phenotype Genetic
		Associations // A Bayesian meta-analysis method for studying
		cross-phenotype genetic associations. It uses summary-level
		data across multiple phenotypes to simultaneously measure the
		evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association and
		estimate an optimal subset of traits associated with the risk
		locus. CPBayes is based on a spike and slab prior. The
		methodology is available from: A Majumdar, T Haldar, S
		Bhattacharya, JS Witte (2018) doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007139.
