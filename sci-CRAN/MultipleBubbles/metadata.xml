		Test and Detection of Explosive Behaviors for Time Series //
		Provides the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and its variations to
		check the existence of bubbles (explosive behavior) for time
		series, based on the article by Peter C. B. Phillips, Shuping
		Shi and Jun Yu (2015a) doi:10.1111/iere.12131. Some functions
		may take a while depending on the size of the data used, or the
