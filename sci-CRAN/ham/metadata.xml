		Healthcare Analysis Methods // Conducts analyses for healthcare
		program evaluations or intervention studies. Calculates
		regression analyses for standard ordinary least squares (OLS or
		linear) or logistic models. Performs regression models used for
		causal modeling such as differences-in-differences (DID) and
		interrupted time series (ITS) models. Provides limited
		interpretations of model results and a ranking of variable
		importance in models. Performs propensity score models, top-
		coding of model outcome variables, and can return new data with
		the newly formed variables. Also performs Cronbach's alpha for
		various scale items (e.g., survey questions). See Github URL
		for examples in the README file. For more details on the
		statistical methods, see Allen  Yen (1979, ISBN:0-8185-0283-5),
