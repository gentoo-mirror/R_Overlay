		Predictions, Comparisons, Slopes, Marginal Means, and Hypothesis
		Tests // Compute and plot predictions, slopes, marginal means,
		and comparisons (contrasts, risk ratios, odds, etc.) for over
		100 classes of statistical and machine learning models in R.
		Conduct linear and non-linear hypothesis tests, or equivalence
		tests. Calculate uncertainty estimates using the delta method,
		bootstrapping, or simulation-based inference. Details can be
		found in Arel-Bundock, Greifer, and Heiss (2024)
