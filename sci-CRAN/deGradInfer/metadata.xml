		Parameter Inference for Systems of Differential Equation //
		Efficient Bayesian parameter inference for systems of ordinary
		differential equations. The inference is based on adaptive
		gradient matching (AGM, Dondelinger et al. 2013
		http://proceedings.mlr.press/v31/dondelinger13a.pdf, Macdonald
		2017 http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7987/1/2017macdonaldphd.pdf),
		which offers orders-of-magnitude improvements in computational
		efficiency over standard methods that require solving the
		differential equation system. Features of the package include
		flexible specification of custom ODE systems as R functions,
		support for missing variables, Bayesian inference via
		population MCMC.
