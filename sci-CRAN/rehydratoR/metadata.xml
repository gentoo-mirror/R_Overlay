		Downloads Tweets from a List of Tweet IDs // Facilitates
		replication of Twitter-based research by handling common
		programming tasks needed when downloading tweets.
		Specifically, it ensures a user does not exceed Twitters rate
		limits, and it saves tweets in moderately sized files. While a
		user could perform these tasks in their own code, doing so may
		be beyond the capabilities of many users.
