		One-to-One Gene-Probeset Mapping for Affymetrix Human Microarrays
		// On Affymetrix gene expression microarrays, a single gene may
		be measured by multiple probe sets. This can present a mild
		conundrum when attempting to evaluate a gene "signature" that
		is defined by gene names rather than by specific probe sets.
		This package provides a one-to-one mapping from gene to "best"
		probe set for four Affymetrix human gene expression
		microarrays: hgu95av2, hgu133a, hgu133plus2, and u133x3p. This
		package also includes the pre-calculated probe set quality
		scores that were used to define the mapping.
