		Inference for Stable Distribution // Developed to perform the
		tasks given by the following. 1-computing the probability
		density function and distribution function of a univariate
		stable distribution; 2- generating realization from univariate
		stable, truncated stable, multivariate elliptically contoured
		stable, and bivariate strictly stable distributions; 3-
		estimating the parameters of univariate symmetric stable, skew
		stable, Cauchy, multivariate elliptically contoured stable, and
		multivariate strictly stable distributions; 4- estimating the
		parameters of the mixture of symmetric stable and mixture of
		Cauchy distributions.
