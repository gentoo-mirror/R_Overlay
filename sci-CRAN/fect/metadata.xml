		Fixed Effects Counterfactuals // Estimates causal effects with
		panel data using the counterfactual methods. It is suitable for
		panel or time-series cross-sectional analysis with binary
		treatments under (hypothetically) baseline randomization.It
		allows a treatment to switch on and off and limited carryover
		effects. It supports linear factor models, a generalization of
		gsynth and the matrix completion method. Implementation details
		can be found in Liu, Wang and Xu (2022) arXiv:2107.00856.
