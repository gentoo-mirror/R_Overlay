		Fixed Effects Counterfactual Estimators // Provides tools for
		estimating causal effects in panel data using counterfactual
		methods, as well as other modern DID estimators. It is designed
		for causal panel analysis with binary treatments under the
		parallel trends assumption. The package supports scenarios
		where treatments can switch on and off and allows for limited
		carryover effects. It includes several imputation estimators,
		such as Gsynth (Xu 2017), linear factor models, and the matrix
		completion method. Detailed methodology is described in Liu,
		Wang, and Xu (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2107.00856 and Chiu et
		al. (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2309.15983. Optionally integrates
		with the "HonestDiDFEct" package for sensitivity analyses
		compatible with imputation estimators. "HonestDiDFEct" is not
		on CRAN but can be obtained from
		https://github.com/lzy318/HonestDiDFEct.
