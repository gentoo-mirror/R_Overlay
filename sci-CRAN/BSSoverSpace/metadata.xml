		Blind Source Separation for Multivariate Spatial Data using Eigen
		Analysis // Provides functions for blind source separation over
		multivariate spatial data, and useful statistics for evaluating
		performance of estimation on mixing matrix. 'BSSoverSpace' is
		based on an eigen analysis of a positive definite matrix
		defined in terms of multiple normalized spatial local
		covariance matrices, and thus can handle moderately high-
		dimensional random fields. This package is an implementation of
		the method described in Zhang, Hao and Yao
		(2022)arXiv:2201.02023.
