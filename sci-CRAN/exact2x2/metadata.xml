		Exact Tests and Confidence Intervals for 2x2 Tables // Calculates
		conditional exact tests (Fisher's exact test, Blaker's exact
		test, or  exact McNemar's test) and unconditional exact tests
		(including score-based tests on differences in proportions,
		ratios of proportions, and odds ratios, and Boshcloo's test)
		with appropriate matching confidence intervals, and provides
		power and sample size calculations. Gives melded confidence
		intervals for the binomial case. Gives boundary-optimized
		rejection region test (Gabriel, et al, 2018,
		DOI:10.1002/sim.7579), an unconditional exact test for the
		situation where the controls are all expected to fail.
