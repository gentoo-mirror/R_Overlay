		File Conversion for 'Gem Infrasound Logger' // Reads data files
		from the 'Gem infrasound logger' for analysis and converts to
		segy format (which is convenient for reading with traditional
		seismic analysis software). The Gem infrasound logger is a low-
		cost, lightweight, low-power instrument for recording
		infrasound in field campaigns; email the maintainer for more
		information.
