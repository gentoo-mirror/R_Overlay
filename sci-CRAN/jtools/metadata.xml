		Analysis and Presentation of Social Scientific Data // This is a
		collection of tools that the author (Jacob) has written for the
		purpose of more efficiently understanding and sharing the
		results of (primarily) regression analyses. There are a number
		of functions focused specifically on the interpretation and
		presentation of interactions. Just about everything supports
		models from the survey package.
