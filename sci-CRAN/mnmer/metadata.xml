		'(m,n)-mer' - A Simple Statistical Feature for Sequence
		Classification // The (m,n)-mer is a statistical feature
		calculated from conditional frequency distributions obtained
		from a FASTA file. The resulting table, along with class
		information, is used to create the classification feature
		matrix. For more information on this method and its
		benchmarking results, refer to Andrade et al.'s upcoming
		publication titled "(m,n)-mer - A Simple Statistical Feature
		for Sequence Classification".
