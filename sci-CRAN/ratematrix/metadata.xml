		Bayesian Estimation of the Evolutionary Rate Matrix // The
		Evolutionary Rate Matrix is a variance-covariance matrix which
		describes both the rates of trait evolution and the
		evolutionary correlation among multiple traits. This package
		has functions to estimate these parameters using Bayesian MCMC.
		It is possible to test if the pattern of evolutionary
		correlations among traits has changed between predictive
		regimes painted along the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
		Regimes can be created a priori or estimated as part of the
		MCMC under a joint estimation approach. The package has
		functions to run MCMC chains, plot results, evaluate
		convergence, and summarize posterior distributions.
