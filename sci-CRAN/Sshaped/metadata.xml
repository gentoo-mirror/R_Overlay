		Nonparametric, Tuning-Free Estimation of an S-Shaped Function //
		Estimation of an S-shaped function and its corresponding
		inflection point via a least squares approach. A sequential
		mixed primal-dual bases algorithm is implemented for the fast
		computation of the estimator. The same algorithm can also be
		used to solve other shape-restricted regression problems, such
		as convex regression. For more details, see the PhD thesis of
		Feng (2021) https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~oyf20/Thesis-
		oyf20-final.pdf.
