		Cluster Circular Systematic Sampling // Draws systematic samples
		from a population that follows linear trend. The function
		returns a matrix comprising of the required samples as its
		column vectors. The samples produced are highly efficient and
		the inter sampling variance is minimum. The scheme will be
		useful in various field like Bioinformatics where the samples
		are expensive and must be precise in reflecting the population
		by possessing least sampling variance.
