		Stochastic Approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) Sampler and Methods
		// Stochastic Approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) is one of the
		celebrated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. It is
		known to be capable of sampling from multimodal or doubly
		intractable distributions. We provide generic SAMC samplers for
		continuous distributions. User-specified densities in R and C++
		are both supported. We also provide functions for specific
		problems that exploit SAMC computation. See Liang et al (2010)
		doi:10.1002/9780470669723 for complete introduction to the
		method.
