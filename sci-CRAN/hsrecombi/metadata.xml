		Estimation of Recombination Rate and Maternal LD in Half-Sibs //
		Paternal recombination rate and maternal linkage disequilibrium
		(LD) are estimated for pairs of biallelic markers such as
		single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from progeny genotypes
		and sire haplotypes. The implementation relies on paternal
		half-sib families. If maternal half-sib families are used, the
		roles of sire/dam are swapped. Multiple families can be
		considered. For parameter estimation, at least one sire has to
		be double heterozygous at the investigated pairs of SNPs. Based
		on recombination rates, genetic distances between markers can
		be estimated. Markers with unusually large recombination rate
		to markers in close proximity (i.e. putatively misplaced
		markers) shall be discarded in this derivation. A workflow
		description is attached as vignette. *A pipeline is available
		at GitHub* https://github.com/wittenburg/hsrecombi Hampel,
