		Practical Tools for Scientific Computations and Visualizations //
		Collection of routines for efficient scientific computations in
		physics and astrophysics. These routines include utility
		functions, advanced computation tools, as well as visualisation
		tools. They can be used, for example, for generating random
		numbers from spherical and custom distributions, information
		and entropy analysis, special Fourier transforms, two-point
		correlation estimation (e.g. as in Landy  Szalay (1993)
		doi:10.1086/172900), binning  gridding of point sets, 2D
		interpolation, Monte Carlo integration, vector arithmetic and
		coordinate transformations. Also included are a non-exhaustive
		list of important constants and cosmological conversion
		functions. The graphics routines can be used to produce and
		export publication-ready scientific plots and movies, e.g. as
		used in Obreschkow et al. (2020) doi:10.1093/mnras/staa445.
		These routines include special color scales, projection
		functions, and bitmap handling routines.
