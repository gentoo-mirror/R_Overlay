		Practical Tools for Scientific Computations and Visualizations //
		Collection of routines for efficient scientific computations in
		physics and astrophysics. These routines include utility
		functions, numerical computation tools, as well as
		visualisation tools. They can be used, for example, for
		generating random numbers from spherical and custom
		distributions, information and entropy analysis, special
		Fourier transforms, two-point correlation estimation (e.g. as
		in Landy  Szalay (1993) doi:10.1086/172900), binning  gridding
		of point sets, 2D interpolation, Monte Carlo integration,
		vector arithmetic and coordinate transformations. Also included
		is a non-exhaustive list of important constants and
		cosmological conversion functions. The graphics routines can be
		used to produce and export publication-ready scientific plots
		and movies, e.g. as used in Obreschkow et al. (2020, MNRAS Vol
		493, Issue 3, Pages 45514569). These routines include special
		color scales, projection functions, and bitmap handling
		routines.
