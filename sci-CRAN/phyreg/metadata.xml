		Implements the Phylogenetic Regression of Grafen (1989) //
		Provides general linear model facilities (single y-variable,
		multiple x-variables with arbitrary mixture of continuous and
		categorical and arbitrary interactions) for cross-species data.
		The theory is in A. Grafen (1989, Proc. R. Soc. B 326, 119-157)
		and aims to cope with both recognised phylogeny (closely
		related species tend to be similar) and unrecognised phylogeny
		(a polytomy usually indicates ignorance about the true
		sequence of binary splits). Version 1.0.1 is a technical update
		required by changes to R: there is no change to the package
		operations.
