		The Phylogenetic Regression of Grafen (1989) // Provides general
		linear model facilities (single y-variable, multiple
		x-variables with arbitrary mixture of continuous and
		categorical and arbitrary interactions) for cross-species data.
		The method is, however, based on the nowadays rather uncommon
		situation in which uncertainty about a phylogeny is well
		represented by adopting a single polytomous tree. The theory is
		in A. Grafen (1989, Proc. R. Soc. B 326, 119-157) and aims to
		cope with both recognised phylogeny (closely related species
		tend to be similar) and unrecognised phylogeny (a polytomy
		usually indicates ignorance about the true  sequence of binary
		splits).
