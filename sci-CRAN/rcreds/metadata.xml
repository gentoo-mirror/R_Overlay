		Securely Use Credentials Within R Scripts // Tools to write a
		list of credentials to an encrypted file and later read from
		that file into R. The goal is to have a useful alternative to
		including username/passwords as part of a script or even stored
		in the clear in a separate text file. Additional tools provided
		which are specific for connecting to a database.
