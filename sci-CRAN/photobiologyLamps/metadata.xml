		Spectral Irradiance Data for Lamps // Spectral emission data for
		some frequently used lamps excluding led emitting diodes (LEDs)
		available as electronic components. Original spectral
		irradiance data for incandescent-, LED- and discharge lamps are
		included. They are complemented by data on the effect of
		temperature on the emission by fluorescent tubes. Part of the
