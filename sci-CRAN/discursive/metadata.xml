		Measuring Discursive Sophistication in Open-Ended Survey
		Responses // A simple approach to measure political
		sophistication based on open-ended survey responses. Discursive
		sophistication captures the complexity of individual attitude
		expression by quantifying its relative size, range, and
		constraint. For more information on the measurement approach
		see: Kraft, Patrick W. 2023. "Women Also Know Stuff:
		Challenging the Gender Gap in Political Sophistication."
