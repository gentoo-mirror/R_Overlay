		Adaptive Estimation in the Linear Random Coefficients Models //
		We implement adaptive estimation of the joint density linear
		model where the coefficients - intercept and slopes - are
		random and independent from regressors which support is a
		proper subset. The estimator proposed in Gaillac and Gautier
		(2019) arXiv:1905.06584 is based on Prolate Spheroidal Wave
		Functions which are computed  efficiently in
		'RandomCoefficients'. This package also provides a parallel
		implementation of the estimator.
