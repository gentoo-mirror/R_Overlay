		Cardiovascular and Autonomic Research Design // Tools that can
		aid in the assessment of the autonomic regulation of
		cardiovascular physiology. The aims of this package are to: 1)
		study electrocardiography (both intervals and morphology) as
		extensions of signal processing, 2) study circadian rhythms and
		how it effects autonomic physiology, 3) assess clinical risk of
		autonomic dysfunction on cardiovascular health through the
		perspective of epidemiology and causality. The analysis of
		circadian rhythms through cosinor analysis are built upon the
		methods by Cornelissen (2014) doi:10.1186/1742-4682-11-16 and
		Refinetti, Cornelissen, Halberg (2014)
