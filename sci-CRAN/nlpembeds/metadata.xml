		Natural Language Processing Embeddings // Provides efficient
		methods to compute co-occurrence matrices, pointwise mutual
		information (PMI) and singular value decomposition (SVD). In
		the biomedical and clinical settings, one challenge is the huge
		size of databases, e.g. when analyzing data of millions of
		patients over tens of years. To address this, this package
		provides functions to efficiently compute monthly co-occurrence
		matrices, which is the computational bottleneck of the
		analysis, by using the 'RcppAlgos' package and sparse matrices.
		Furthermore, the functions can be called on 'SQL' databases,
		enabling the computation of co-occurrence matrices of tens of
		gigabytes of data, representing millions of patients over tens
		of years. Partly based on Hong C. (2021)
