		Integrated Prediction using Uni-Variate and Multivariate Random
		Forests // An implementation of a framework for drug
		sensitivity prediction from various genetic characterizations
		using ensemble approaches. Random Forests or Multivariate
		Random Forest predictive models can be generated from each
		genetic characterization that are then combined using a Least
		Square Regression approach. It also provides options for the
		use of different error estimation approaches of Leave-one-out,
		Bootstrap, N-fold cross validation and 0.632+Bootstrap along
		with generation of prediction confidence interval using
		Jackknife-after-Bootstrap approach.
