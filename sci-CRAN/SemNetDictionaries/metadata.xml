		Dictionaries for the 'SemNetCleaner' Package // Implements
		dictionaries that can be used in the 'SemNetCleaner' package.
		Also includes several functions aimed at facilitating the text
		cleaning analysis in the 'SemNetCleaner' package. This package
		is designed to integrate and update word lists and dictionaries
		based on each user's individual needs by allowing users to
		store and save their own dictionaries. Dictionaries can be
		added to the 'SemNetDictionaries' package by submitting user-
		defined dictionaries to
		https://github.com/AlexChristensen/SemNetDictionaries.
