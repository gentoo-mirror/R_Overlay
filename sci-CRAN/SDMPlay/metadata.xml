		Species Distribution Modelling Playground // Functions provided
		by this pedagogic package allow to compute models with two
		popular machine learning approaches, BRT (Boosted Regression
		Trees) and MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) applied on sets of marine
		biological and environmental data. They include the possibility
		of managing the main parameters for the construction of the
		models. Classic tools to evaluate model performance are
		provided (Area Under the Curve, omission rate and confusion
		matrix, map standard deviation) and are completed with tools to
		perform null models. The biological dataset includes original
		occurrences of two species of the class Echinoidea (sea
		urchins) present on the Kerguelen Plateau and that show
		contrasted ecological niches. The environmental dataset
		includes the corresponding statistics for 15 abiotic and biotic
		descriptors summarized for the Kerguelen Plateau and for
		different periods in a raster format. The package can be used
		for practicals to teach and learn the basics of species
		distribution modelling. Maps of potential distribution can be
		produced based on the example data included in the package,
		which brings prior observations of the influence of spatial and
		temporal heterogeneities on modelling performances. The user
		can also provide his own datasets to use the modelling
		functions.
