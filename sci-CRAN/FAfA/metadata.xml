		Factor Analysis for All // Provides a comprehensive Shiny-based
		graphical user interface for conducting a wide range of factor
		analysis procedures. 'FAfA' (Factor Analysis for All) guides
		users through data uploading, assumption checking
		(descriptives, collinearity, multivariate normality, outliers),
		data wrangling (variable exclusion, data splitting), factor
		retention analysis (e.g., Parallel Analysis, Hull method, EGA),
		Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with various rotation and
		extraction methods, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for
		model testing, Reliability Analysis (e.g., Cronbach's Alpha,
		McDonald's Omega), Measurement Invariance testing across
		groups, and item weighting techniques. Results are presented in
		user-friendly tables and plots, with options for downloading
		outputs.
