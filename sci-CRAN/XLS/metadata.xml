		A Modeling Approach that Optimizes Future Errors in Least Squares
		// Given the date column as an ascending entry, future errors
		are included in the sum of squares of error that should be
		minimized based on the number of steps and weights you
		determine. Thus, it is prevented that the variables affect each
		other's coefficients unrealistically.
