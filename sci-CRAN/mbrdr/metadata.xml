		Model-Based Response Dimension Reduction // Functions for model-
		based response dimension reduction. Usual dimension reduction
		methods in multivariate regression focus on the reduction of
		predictors, not responses.  The response dimension reduction is
		theoretically founded in Yoo and Cook (2008)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.07.029. Later, three model-based
		response dimension reduction approaches are proposed in Yoo
		(2016) doi:10.1080/02331888.2017.1410152 and Yoo (2019)
		doi:10.1016/j.jkss.2019.02.001. The method by Yoo and Cook
		(2008) is based on non-parametric ordinary least squares, but
		the model-based approaches are done through maximum likelihood
		estimation. For two model-based response dimension reduction
		methods called principal fitted response reduction and
		unstructured principal fitted response reduction, chi-squared
		tests are provided for determining the dimension of the
		response subspace.
