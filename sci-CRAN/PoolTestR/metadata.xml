		Prevalence and Regression for Pool-Tested (Group-Tested) Data //
		An easy-to-use tool for working with presence/absence tests on
		'pooled' or 'grouped' samples. The primary application is for
		estimating prevalence of a marker in a population based on the
		results of tests on pooled specimens. This sampling method is
		often employed in surveillance of rare conditions in humans or
		animals (e.g. molecular xenomonitoring). The package was
		initially conceived as an R-based alternative to the molecular
		xenomonitoring software, 'PoolScreen'
		https://sites.uab.edu/statgenetics/software/. However, it goes
		further, allowing for estimates of prevalence to be adjusted
		for hierarchical sampling frames, and perform flexible mixed-
		effect regression analyses (McLure et al. Environmental
		Modelling and Software. DOI:10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105158). The
		package is currently in early stages, however more features are
		planned or in the works: e.g. adjustments for imperfect test
		specificity/sensitivity, functions for helping with optimal
		experimental design, and functions for spatial modelling.
