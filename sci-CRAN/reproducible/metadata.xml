		A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package
		Management // Collection of high-level, machine- and OS-
		independent tools for making deeply reproducible and reusable
		content in R. The two workhorse functions are Cache and
		prepInputs; these allow for: nested caching, robust to
		environments, and objects with environments (like functions);
		and data retrieval and processing in continuous workflow
		environments. In all cases, efforts are made to make the first
		and subsequent calls of functions have the same result, but
		vastly faster at subsequent times by way of checksums and
		digesting. Several features are still under active development,
		including cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for sharing
		between users. Several advanced options are available, see
		?reproducibleOptions.
