		A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package
		Management // Collection of high-level, robust, machine- and
		OS-independent tools for making deeply reproducible and
		reusable content in R. The three workhorse functions are Cache,
		prepInputs, and Require; these allow for nested caching, robust
		to environments, and objects with environments (like
		functions), and data retrieval and processing, and package
		handling in continuous workflow environments. In all cases,
		efforts are made to make the first and subsequent calls of
		functions have the same result, but vastly faster at subsequent
		times by way of checksums and digesting. Several features are
		still under active development, including cloud storage of
		cached objects, allowing for sharing between users.
