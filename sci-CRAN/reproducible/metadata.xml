		A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package
		Management // Built on top of 'git2r' and 'archivist', this
		package aims at making high-level, robust, machine and OS
		independent tools for making deeply reproducible and reusable
		content in R. This includes light weight package management
		(similar to 'packrat' and 'checkpoint', but more flexible,
		lightweight and simpler than both), plus it includes tools for
		caching, and accessing GitHub repositories.
