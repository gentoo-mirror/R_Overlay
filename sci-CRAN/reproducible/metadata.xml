		A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package
		Management // Collection of high-level, robust, machine- and
		OS-independent tools for making deeply reproducible and
		reusable content in R. This includes light weight package
		management (similar to 'packrat' and 'checkpoint', but more
		flexible, lightweight, simpler and less tested than both),
		tools for caching, downloading and verifying or writing
		checksums, post-processing of common spatial datasets, and
		accessing GitHub repositories. Some features are still under
		active development.
