		Enhance Reproducibility of R Code // A collection of high-level,
		machine- and OS-independent tools for making deeply
		reproducible and reusable content in R. The two workhorse
		functions are Cache() and prepInputs(). Cache() allows for
		nested caching, is robust to environments and objects with
		environments (like functions), and has deals with some classes
		of file-backed R objects e.g., from terra and raster packages.
		Both functions have been developed to be foundational
		components of data retrieval and processing in continuous
		workflow situations. In both functions, efforts are made to
		make the first and subsequent calls of functions have the same
		result, but faster at subsequent times by way of checksums and
		digesting. Several features are still under development,
		including cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for sharing
		between users. Several advanced options are available, see
		?reproducibleOptions().
