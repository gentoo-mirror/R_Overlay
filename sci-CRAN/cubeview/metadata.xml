		View 3D Raster Cubes Interactively // Creates a 3D data cube view
		of a RasterStack/Brick, typically a collection/array of
		RasterLayers (along z-axis) with the same geographical extent
		(x and y dimensions) and resolution, provided by package
		'raster'. Slices through each dimension (x/y/z), freely
		adjustable in location, are mapped to the visible sides of the
		cube. The cube can be freely rotated. Zooming and panning can
		be used to focus on different areas of the cube.
