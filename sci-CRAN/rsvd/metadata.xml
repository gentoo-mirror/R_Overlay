		Randomized Singular Value Decomposition // Low-rank matrix
		decompositions are fundamental tools and widely used for data
		analysis, dimension reduction, and data compression.
		Classically, highly accurate deterministic matrix algorithms
		are used for this task. However, the emergence of large-scale
		data has severely challenged our computational ability to
		analyze big data. The concept of randomness has been
		demonstrated as an effective strategy to quickly produce
		approximate answers to familiar problems such as the singular
		value decomposition (SVD). The rsvd package provides several
		randomized matrix algorithms such as the randomized singular
		value decomposition (rsvd), randomized principal component
		analysis (rpca), randomized robust principal component analysis
		(rrpca), randomized interpolative decomposition (rid), and the
		randomized CUR decomposition (rcur). In addition several plot
		functions are provided.
