		Knockoff Boosted Tree // A novel strategy for conducting variable
		selection without prior model topology knowledge using the
		knockoff method (Barber and Candes (2015)
		doi:10.1214/15-AOS1337) with extreme boosted tree models (Chen
		and Guestrin (2016) doi:10.1145/2939672.2939785). This method
		is inspired by the original knockoff method, where the
		differences between original and knockoff variables are used
		for variable selection with false discovery rate control. In
		addition to the original knockoff generating methods, two new
		sampling methods are available to be implemented, namely the
		sparse covariance and principal component knockoff methods. As
		results, the indices of selected variables are returned.
