		Sparse Additive Modelling // Computationally efficient tools for
		high dimensional predictive modeling (regression and
		classification). SAM is short for sparse additive modeling, and
		adopts the computationally efficient basis spline technique. We
		solve  the optimization problems by various computational
		algorithms including the block coordinate descent algorithm,
		fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm, and newton method.
		The computation is further accelerated by warm-start and
		active-set tricks.
