		Estimation and Simulation of Multi-Binary Response Models //
		Multi-binary response models are a class of models that allow
		for the estimation of multiple binary outcomes simultaneously.
		This package provides functions to estimate and simulate these
		models using the Discrete Exponential-Family Models [DEFM]
		framework. In it, we implement the models described in Vega
		Yon, Valente, and Pugh (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.00627.
		DEFMs include Exponential-Family Random Graph Models [ERGMs],
		which characterize graphs using sufficient statistics, which is
		also the core of DEFMs. Using sufficient statistics, we can
		describe the data through meaningful motifs, for example,
		transitions between different states, joint distribution of the
		outcomes, etc.
