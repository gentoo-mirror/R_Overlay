		Automatic Forecasting Procedure // Implements a procedure for
		forecasting time series data based on an additive model where
		non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily
		seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time
		series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of
		historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts
		in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
