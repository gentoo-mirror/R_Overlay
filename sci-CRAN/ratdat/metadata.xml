		Portal Project Teaching Database // A simplified version of the
		Portal Project Database designed for teaching. It provides a
		real world example of life-history, population, and ecological
		data, with sufficient complexity to teach many aspects of data
		analysis and management, but with many complexities removed to
		allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being
		taught. The full database (which should be used for research)
		is available at https://github.com/weecology/PortalData.
