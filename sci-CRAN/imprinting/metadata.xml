		Calculate Birth Year-Specific Probabilities of Immune Imprinting
		to Influenza // Reconstruct birth-year specific probabilities
		of immune imprinting to influenza A, using the methods of
		Gostic et al. (2016) doi:10.1126/science.aag1322. Plot, save,
		or export the calculated probabilities for use in your own
		research. By default, the package calculates subtype-specific
		imprinting probabilities, but with user-provided frequency
		data, it is possible to calculate probabilities for arbitrary
		kinds of primary exposure to influenza A, including primary
		vaccination and exposure to specific clades, strains, etc.
