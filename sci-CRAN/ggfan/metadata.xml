		Summarise a Distribution Through Coloured Intervals // Implements
		the functionality of the 'fanplot' package as 'geoms' for
		'ggplot2'. Designed for summarising MCMC samples from a
		posterior distribution, where a visualisation is desired for
		several values of a continuous covariate. Increasing posterior
		intervals of the sampled quantity are mapped to a continuous
		colour scale.
