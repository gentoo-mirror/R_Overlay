		Dunn's Test of Multiple Comparisons Using Rank Sums // Computes
		Dunn's test (1964) for stochastic dominance and reports the
		results among multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-
		Wallis test for 0th-order stochastic dominance among k groups
		(Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). 'dunn.test' makes k(k-1)/2 multiple
		pairwise comparisons based on Dunn's z-test-statistic
		approximations to the actual rank statistics. The null
		hypothesis for each pairwise comparison is that the probability
		of observing a randomly selected value from the first group
		that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second
		group equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that
		of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum
		test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, and the
		distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in
		location, Dunn's test may be understood as a test for median
		difference and for mean difference. 'dunn.test' accounts for
		tied ranks.
