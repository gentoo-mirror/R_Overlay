		Weighted Confusion Matrix // Allows users to create weighted
		confusion matrices and accuracy metrics that help with the
		model selection process for classification problems, where
		distance from the correct category is important. The package
		includes several weighting schemes which can be parameterized,
		as well as custom configuration options. Furthermore, users can
		decide whether they wish to positively or negatively affect the
		accuracy score as a result of applying weights to the confusion
		matrix. Functions are included to calculate accuracy metrics
		for imbalanced data. Finally, 'wconf' integrates well with the
		'caret' package, but it can also work standalone when provided
		data in matrix form. References: Kuhn, M. (2008) "Building
