		Optimal Experimental Designs for Accelerated Life Testing //
		Creates the optimal (D, U and I) designs for the accelerated
		life testing with right censoring or interval censoring. It
		uses generalized linear model (GLM) approach to derive the
		asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of regression
		coefficients. The failure time distribution is assumed to
		follow Weibull distribution with a known shape parameter and
		log-linear link functions are used to model the relationship
		between failure time parameters and stress variables. The
		acceleration model may have multiple stress factors, although
		most ALTs involve only two or less stress factors. ALTopt
		package also provides several plotting functions including
		contour plot, Fraction of Use Space (FUS) plot and Variance
		Dispersion graphs of Use Space (VDUS) plot.
