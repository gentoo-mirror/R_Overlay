		PHATE - Potential of Heat-Diffusion for Affinity-Based Transition
		Embedding // PHATE is a tool for visualizing high dimensional
		single-cell data with natural progressions or trajectories.
		PHATE uses a novel conceptual framework for learning and
		visualizing the manifold inherent to biological systems in
		which smooth transitions mark the progressions of cells from
		one state to another. To see how PHATE can be applied to
		single-cell RNA-seq datasets from hematopoietic stem cells,
		human embryonic stem cells, and bone marrow samples, check out
		our preprint on bioRxiv at
		http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/24/120378.
