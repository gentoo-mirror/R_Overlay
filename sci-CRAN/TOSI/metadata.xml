		Two-Directional Simultaneous Inference for High-Dimensional
		Models // A general framework of two directional simultaneous
		inference is provided for high-dimensional as well as the fixed
		dimensional models with manifest variable or latent variable
		structure, such as high-dimensional mean models, high-
		dimensional sparse regression models, and high-dimensional
		latent factors models. It is making the simultaneous inference
		on a set of parameters from two directions, one is testing
		whether the estimated zero parameters indeed are zero and the
		other is testing whether there exists zero in the parameter set
		of non-zero. More details can be referred to Wei Liu, et al.
