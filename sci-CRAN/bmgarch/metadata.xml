		Bayesian Multivariate GARCH Models // Fit Bayesian multivariate
		GARCH models using 'Stan' for full Bayesian inference. Generate
		(weighted) forecasts for means, variances (volatility) and
		correlations. Currently DCC(P,Q), CCC(P,Q), pdBEKK(P,Q), and
		BEKK(P,Q) parameterizations are implemented, based either on a
		multivariate gaussian normal or student-t distribution. DCC and
		CCC models are based on Engle (2002)
		doi:10.1198/073500102288618487 and Bollerslev (1990). The BEKK
		parameterization follows Engle and Kroner (1995)
		doi:10.1017/S0266466600009063 while the pdBEKK as well as the
		estimation approach for this package is described in Rast et
		al. (2020) doi:10.31234/osf.io/j57pk. The fitted models contain
		'rstan' objects and can be examined with 'rstan' functions.
