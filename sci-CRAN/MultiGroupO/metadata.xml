		MultiGroup Method and Simulation Data Analysis // Two method new
		of multigroup and simulation of data. The first technique
		called multigroup PCA (mgPCA) this multivariate exploration
		approach that has the idea of considering the structure of
		groups and / or different types of variables. On the other
		hand, the second multivariate technique called Multigroup
		Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) it is another multivariate
		exploration method that is based on projections. In addition, a
		method called Single Dimension Exploration (SDE) was
		incorporated for to analyze the exploration of the data. It
		could help us in a better way to observe the behavior of the
		multigroup data with certain variables of interest.
