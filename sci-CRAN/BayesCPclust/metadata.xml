		A Bayesian Approach for Clustering Constant-Wise Change-Point
		Data // A Gibbs sampler algorithm was developed to estimate
		change points in constant-wise data sequences while performing
		clustering simultaneously. The algorithm is described in da
		Cruz, A. C. and de Souza, C. P. E "A Bayesian Approach for
		Clustering Constant-wise Change-point Data"
