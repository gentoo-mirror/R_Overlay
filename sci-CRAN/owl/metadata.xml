		Generalized Linear Models Regularized with the Sorted L1-Norm //
		Efficient implementations for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation
		(SLOPE): generalized linear models regularized with the sorted
		L1-norm (Bogdan et al. (2015) doi:10/gfgwzt) or, equivalently,
		ordered weighted L1-norm (OWL). Supported models include
		ordinary least-squares regression, binomial regression,
		multinomial regression, and Poisson regression. Both dense and
		sparse predictor matrices are supported. In addition, the
		package features predictor screening rules that enable fast and
		efficient solutions to high-dimensional problems.
