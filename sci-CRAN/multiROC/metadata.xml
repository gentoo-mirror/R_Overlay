		Calculating and Visualizing ROC and PR Curves Across Multi-Class
		Classifications // Tools to solve real-world problems with
		multiple classes classifications by computing the areas under
		ROC and PR curve via micro-averaging and macro-averaging. The
		vignettes of this package can be found via
		https://github.com/WandeRum/multiROC. The methodology is
		described in V. Van Asch (2013)
