		Calculating and Visualizing ROC Curves Across Multi-Class
		Classifications // Tools to solve real-world problems with
		multiple classes by computing the areas under ROC curve via
		micro-averaging and macro-averaging. The methodology is
		described in V. Van Asch (2013)
		https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~vincent/pdf/microaverage.pdf
		and Pedregosa et al. (2011) http://scikit-
