		Simulate a Data Frame Mirroring an Input and Produce Shareable
		Simulation Code // The 'dfmirroR' package allows users to input
		a data frame, simulate some number of observations based on
		specified columns of that data frame, and then outputs a string
		that contains the code to re-create the simulation. The goal is
		to both provide workable test data sets and provide users with
		the information they need to set up reproducible examples with
		team members. This package was created out of a need to share
		examples in cases where data are private and where a full data
		frame is not needed for testing or coordinating.
