		Estimating Length-Based Indicators for Fish Stock // Provides
		tools for estimating length-based indicators from length
		frequency data to assess fish stock status and manage fisheries
		sustainably. Implements methods from Cope and Punt (2009)
		doi:10.1577/C08-025.1 for data-limited stock assessment and
		Froese (2004) doi:10.1111/j.1467-2979.2004.00144.x for
		detecting overfishing using simple indicators. Key functions
		include: FrequencyTable(): Calculate the frequency table from
		the collected and also the extract the length frequency data
		from the frequency table with the upper length_range. A numeric
		value specifying the bin width for class intervals. If not
		provided, the bin width is automatically calculated using
		Sturges (1926) doi:10.1080/01621459.1926.10502161 formula.
		CalPar(): Calculates various lengths used in fish stock
		assessment as biological length indicators such as asymptotic
		length (Linf), maximum length (Lmax), length at sexual maturity
		(Lm), and optimal length (Lopt). FishPar(): Calculates length-
		based indicators (LBIs) proposed by Froese (2004)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-2979.2004.00144.x such as the percentage of
		mature fish (Pmat), percentage of optimal length fish (Popt),
		percentage of mega spawners (Pmega), and the sum of these as
		Pobj. This function also estimates confidence intervals for
		different lengths, visualizes length frequency distributions,
		and provides data frames containing calculated values.
		FishSS(): Makes decisions based on input from Cope and Punt
		(2009) doi:10.1577/C08-025.1 and parameters calculated by
		FishPar() (e.g., Pobj, Pmat, Popt, LM_ratio) to determine stock
		status as target spawning biomass (TSB40) and limit spawning
		biomass (LSB25). These tools support fisheries management
		decisions by providing robust, data-driven insights.
