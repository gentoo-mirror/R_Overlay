		R Toolbox for Unsupervised Spectral Clustering // Toolbox
		containing a variety of spectral clustering tools functions.
		Among the tools available are the hierarchical spectral
		clustering algorithm, the Shi and Malik clustering algorithm,
		the Perona and Freeman algorithm, the non-normalized
		clustering, the Von Luxburg algorithm, the Partition Around
		Medoids clustering algorithm, a multi-level clustering
		algorithm, recursive clustering and the fast method for all
		clustering algorithm. As well as other tools needed to run
		these algorithms or useful for unsupervised spectral
		clustering. This toolbox aims to gather the main tools for
		unsupervised spectral classification. See http://mawenzi.univ-
		littoral.fr/ for more information and documentation.
