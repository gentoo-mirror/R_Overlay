		Retrieve Disease-Related Genes from Public Sources // For
		researchers to quickly and comprehensively acquire disease
		genes, so as to understand the mechanism of disease, we
		developed this program to acquire disease-related genes. The
		data is integrated from three public databases. The three
		databases are 'eDGAR', 'DrugBank' and 'MalaCards'. The 'eDGAR'
		is a comprehensive database, containing data on the
		relationship between disease and genes. 'DrugBank' contains
		information on 13443 drugs and 5157 targets. 'MalaCards'
		integrates human disease information, including disease-related
		genes.
