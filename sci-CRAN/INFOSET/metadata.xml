		Computing a New Informative Distribution Set of Asset Returns //
		Estimation of the most-left informative set of gross returns
		(i.e., the informative set). The procedure to compute the
		informative set adjusts the method proposed by Mariani et al.

		(2022b) doi:10.1007/s10287-022-00422-2 to gross returns of
		financial assets. This is accomplished through an adaptive
		algorithm that identifies sub-groups of gross returns in each
		iteration by approximating their distribution with a sequence
		of two-component log-normal mixtures. These sub-groups emerge
		when a significant change in the distribution occurs below the
		median of the financial returns, with their boundary termed as
		the change point" of the mixture. The process concludes when no
		further change points are detected. The outcome encompasses
		parameters of the leftmost mixture distributions and change
		points of the analyzed financial time series.
