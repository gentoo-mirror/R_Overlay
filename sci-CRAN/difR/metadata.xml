		Collection of Methods to Detect Dichotomous and Polytomous
		Differential Item Functioning (DIF) // Methods to detect
		differential item functioning (DIF) in dichotomous and
		polytomous items, using both classical and modern approaches.
		These include Mantel-Haenszel procedures, logistic regression
		(including ordinal models), and regularization-based methods
		such as LASSO. Uniform and non-uniform DIF effects can be
		detected, and some methods support multiple focal groups. The
		package also provides tools for anchor purification, rest score
		matching, effect size estimation, and DIF simulation. See
		Magis, Beland, Tuerlinckx, and De Boeck (2010, Behavior
		Research Methods, 42, 847862, doi:10.3758/BRM.42.3.847) for a
		general overview.
