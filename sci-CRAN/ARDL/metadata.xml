		ARDL, ECM and Bounds-Test for Cointegration // Creates complex
		autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models and constructs the
		underlying unrestricted and restricted error correction model
		(ECM) automatically, just by providing the order. It also
		performs the bounds-test for cointegration as described in
		Pesaran et al. (2001) doi:10.1002/jae.616 and provides the
		multipliers and the cointegrating equation. The validity and
		the accuracy of this package have been verified by successfully
		replicating the results of Pesaran et al. (2001) in
		Natsiopoulos and Tzeremes (2022) doi:10.1002/jae.2919.
