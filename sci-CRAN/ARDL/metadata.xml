		ARDL, ECM and Bounds-Test for Cointegration // Creates complex
		autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models providing just the
		order and automatically constructs the underlying unrestricted
		and restricted error correction model (ECM). It also performs
		the bounds-test for cointegration as described in Pesaran et
		al. (2001) doi:10.1002/jae.616 and provides the multipliers and
		the cointegrating equation.
