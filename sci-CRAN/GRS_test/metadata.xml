		GRS Test for Portfolio Efficiency, Its Statistical Power
		Analysis, and Optimal Significance Level Calculation //
		Computational resources for test proposed by Gibbons, Ross,
		Shanken (1989)DOI:10.2307/1913625. It also has the functions
		for the power analysis and the choice of the optimal level of
		significance. The optimal level is determined by minimizing the
		expected loss from hypothesis testing.
