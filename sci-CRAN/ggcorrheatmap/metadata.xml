		Make Flexible 'ggplot2' Correlation Heatmaps // Create
		correlation heatmaps with 'ggplot2' and customise them with
		flexible annotation and clustering. Symmetric heatmaps can use
		triangular or mixed layouts, removing redundant information or
		displaying complementary information in the two halves. There
		is also support for general heatmaps not displaying
		correlations.
