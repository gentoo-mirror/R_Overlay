		Automated Classification of Mass Spectra // Functions to classify
		mass spectra in known categories, and to determine discriminant
		mass-over-charge values. It includes easy-to-use functions for
		pre-processing mass spectra, functions to determine
		discriminant mass-over-charge values (m/z) from a library of
		mass spectra corresponding to different categories, and
		functions to predict the category (species, phenotypes, etc.)
		associated to a mass spectrum from a list of selected mass-
		over-charge values.
