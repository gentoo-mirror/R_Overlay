		Automated Classification of Mass Spectra // Functions to classify
		mass spectra in known categories, and to determine discriminant
		mass-to-charge values. It includes easy-to-use functions for
		preprocessing mass spectra, functions to determine discriminant
		mass-to-charge values (m/z) from a library of mass spectra
		corresponding to different categories, and functions to predict
		the category (species, phenotypes, etc.) associated to a mass
		spectrum from a list of selected mass-to-charge values. If you
		use this package in your research, please cite the associated
		publication (doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2025.128796). For a
		comprehensive guide, additional applications, and detailed
		examples of using this package, please visit our GitHub
		repository (https://github.com/agodmer/MSclassifR_examples).
