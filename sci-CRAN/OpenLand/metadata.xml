		Quantitative Analysis and Visualization of LUCC // Tools for the
		analysis of land use and cover (LUC) time series. It includes
		support for loading spatiotemporal raster data and synthesized
		spatial plotting. Several LUC change (LUCC) metrics in regular
		or irregular time intervals can be extracted and visualized
		through one- and multistep sankey and chord diagrams. A
		complete intensity analysis according to Aldwaik and Pontius
		(2012) doi:10.1016/j.landurbplan.2012.02.010 is implemented,
