		Latent Space-Based Transfer Learning // Implements transfer
		learning methods for low-rank matrix estimation. These methods
		leverage similarity in the latent row and column spaces between
		the source and target populations to improve estimation in the
		target population. The methods include the LatEnt spAce-based
		tRaNsfer lEaRning (LEARNER) method and the direct projection
		LEARNER (D-LEARNER) method described by McGrath et al. (2024)
