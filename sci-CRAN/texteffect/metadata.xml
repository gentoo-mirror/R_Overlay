		Discovering Latent Treatments in Text Corpora and Estimating
		Their Causal Effects // Implements the approach described in
		Fong and Grimmer (2016)
		https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1151.pdf for
		automatically discovering latent treatments from a corpus and
		estimating the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of each
		treatment.  The data is divided into a training and test set.
		The supervised Indian Buffet Process (sibp) is used to discover
		latent treatments in the training set.  The fitted model is
		then applied to the test set to infer the values of the latent
		treatments in the test set.  Finally, Y is regressed on the
		latent treatments in the test set to estimate the causal effect
		of each treatment.
