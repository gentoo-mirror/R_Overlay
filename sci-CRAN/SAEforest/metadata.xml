		Mixed Effect Random Forests for Small Area Estimation // Mixed
		Effects Random Forests (MERFs) are a data-driven, nonparametric
		alternative to current methods of Small Area Estimation (SAE).
		'SAEforest' provides functions for the estimation of regionally
		disaggregated linear and nonlinear indicators using survey
		sample data. Included procedures facilitate the estimation of
		domain-level economic and inequality metrics and assess
		associated uncertainty. Emphasis lies on straightforward
		interpretation and visualization of results. From a
		methodological perspective, the package builds on approaches
		discussed in Krennmair and Schmid (2022) arXiv:2201.10933v2 and
		Krennmair et al. (2022) arXiv:2204.10736.
