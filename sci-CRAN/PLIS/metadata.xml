		Multiplicity control using Pooled LIS statistic // PLIS is a
		multiple testing procedure for testing several groups of
		hypotheses. Linear dependency is expected from the hypotheses
		within the same group and is modeled by hidden Markov Models.
		It is noted that, for PLIS, a smaller p value does not
		necessarily imply more significance because of dependency among
		the hypotheses. A typical application of PLIS is to analyze
		genome wide association studies datasets, where SNPs from the
		same chromosome are treated as a group and exhibit strong
		linear genomic dependency.
