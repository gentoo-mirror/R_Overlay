		Multiplicity Control using Pooled LIS Statistic // A multiple
		testing procedure for testing several groups of hypotheses is
		implemented. Linear dependency among the hypotheses within the
		same group is modeled by using hidden Markov Models. It is
		noted that a smaller p value does not necessarily imply more
		significance due to the dependency. A typical application is to
		analyze genome wide association studies datasets, where SNPs
		from the same chromosome are treated as a group and exhibit
		strong linear genomic dependency. See Wei Z, Sun W, Wang K,
		Hakonarson H (2009) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp476 for more
		details.
