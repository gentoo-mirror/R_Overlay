		Modular Leaf Ordering Methods for Dendrogram Nodes // An
		implementation of functions to optimize ordering of nodes in a
		dendrogram, without affecting the meaning of the dendrogram. A
		dendrogram can be sorted based on the average distance of
		subtrees, or based on the smallest distance value. These
		sorting methods improve readability and interpretability of
		tree structure, especially for tasks such as comparison of
		different distance measures or linkage types and identification
		of tight clusters and outliers. As a result, it also introduces
		more meaningful reordering for a coupled heatmap visualization.
		This method is described in "dendsort: modular leaf ordering
		methods for dendrogram representations in R", F1000Research
		2014, 3: 177 doi:10.12688/f1000research.4784.1.
