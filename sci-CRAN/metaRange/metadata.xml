		Framework to Build Mechanistic and Metabolic Constrained Species
		Distribution Models // Build spatially and temporally explicit
		process-based species distribution models, that can include an
		arbitrary number of environmental factors, species and
		processes including metabolic constraints and species
		interactions. The focus of the package is simulating
		populations of one or multiple species in a grid-based
		landscape and studying the meta-population dynamics and
		emergent patterns that arise from the interaction of species
		under complex environmental conditions. It provides functions
		for common ecological processes such as negative exponential,
		kernel-based dispersal (see Nathan et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608898.003.0015), calculation of
		the environmental suitability based on cardinal values ( Yin et
		al. (1995) doi:10.1016/0168-1923(95)02236-Q, simplified by Yan
		and Hunt (1999) doi:10.1006/anbo.1999.0955 see eq: 4),
		reproduction in form of an Ricker model (see Ricker (1954)
		doi:10.1139/f54-039 and Cabral and Schurr (2010)
		doi:10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00492.x), as well as metabolic
		scaling based on the metabolic theory of ecology (see Brown et
		al. (2004) doi:10.1890/03-9000 and Brown, Sibly and Kodric-
		Brown (2012) doi:10.1002/9781119968535.ch).
