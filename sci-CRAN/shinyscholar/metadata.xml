		A Template for Creating Reproducible 'shiny' Applications //
		Create a skeleton 'shiny' application with create_template()
		that is reproducible, can be saved and meets academic standards
		for attribution. Forked from 'wallace'. Code is split into
		modules that are loaded and linked together automatically and
		each call one function. Guidance pages explain modules to users
		and flexible logging informs them of any errors. Options enable
		asynchronous operations, viewing of source code, interactive
		maps and data tables. Use to create complex analytical
		applications, following best practices in open science and
		software development. Includes functions for automating
		repetitive development tasks and an example application at
		run_shinyscholar() that requires
		install.packages("shinyscholar", dependencies = TRUE). A guide
		to developing applications can be found on the package website.
