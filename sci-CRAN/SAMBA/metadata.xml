		Selection and Misclassification Bias Adjustment for Logistic
		Regression Models // Health research using data from electronic
		health records (EHR) has gained popularity, but
		misclassification of EHR-derived disease status and lack of
		representativeness of the study sample can result in
		substantial bias in effect estimates and can impact power and
		type I error for association tests. Here, the assumed target of
		inference is the relationship between binary disease status and
		predictors modeled using a logistic regression model. 'SAMBA'
		implements several methods for obtaining bias-corrected point
		estimates along with valid standard errors as proposed in
		Beesley and Mukherjee (2020) doi:10.1101/2019.12.26.19015859,
		currently under review.
