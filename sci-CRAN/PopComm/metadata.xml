		Population-Level Cell-Cell Communication Analysis Tools //
		Facilitates population-level analysis of ligand-receptor (LR)
		interactions using large-scale single-cell transcriptomic data.
		Identifies significant LR pairs and quantifies their
		interactions through correlation-based filtering and projection
		score computations. Designed for large-sample single-cell
		studies, the package employs statistical modeling, including
		linear regression, to investigate LR relationships between cell
		types. It provides a systematic framework for understanding
		cell-cell communication, uncovering regulatory interactions and
		signaling mechanisms. Offers tools for LR pair-level, sample-
		level, and differential interaction analyses, with
		comprehensive visualization support to aid biological
		interpretation. The methodology is described in a manuscript
		currently under review and will be referenced here once
		published or publicly available.
