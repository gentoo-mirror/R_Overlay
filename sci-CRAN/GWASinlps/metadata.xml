		Nonlocal Prior Based Iterative SNP Selection Tool for Genome-Wide
		Association Studies // Performs variable selection with data
		from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) combining, in an
		iterative variable selection framework, the computational
		efficiency of the screen-and-select approach based on some
		association learning and the parsimonious uncertainty
		quantification provided by the use of nonlocal priors, as
		described in Sanyal et al. (2018) [submitted].
