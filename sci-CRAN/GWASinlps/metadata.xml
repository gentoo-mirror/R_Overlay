		Non-Local Prior Based Iterative Variable Selection Tool for
		Genome-Wide Association Studies // Performs variable selection
		with data from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), or other
		high-dimensional data with continuous, binary or survival
		outcomes, combining in an iterative framework the computational
		efficiency of the structured screen-and-select variable
		selection strategy based on some association learning and the
		parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided by the use of
		non-local priors (see Sanyal et al., 2019
		DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty472).
