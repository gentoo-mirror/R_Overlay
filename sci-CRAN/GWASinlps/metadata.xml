		Non-Local Prior Based Iterative Variable Selection Tool for
		Genome-Wide Association Studies // Performs variable selection
		with data from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), or other
		high-dimensional data, combining in an iterative framework, the
		computational efficiency of the screen-and-select variable
		selection approach based on some association learning and the
		parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided by the use of
		non-local priors as described in Sanyal et al. (2019)
