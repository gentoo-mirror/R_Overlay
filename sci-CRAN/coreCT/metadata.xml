		Programmatic Analysis of Sediment Cores Using Computed Tomography
		Imaging // Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a powerful tool
		for understanding the composition of sediment cores. This
		package streamlines and accelerates the analysis of CT data
		generated in the context of environmental science. Included are
		tools for processing raw DICOM images to characterize sediment
		composition (sand, peat, etc.). Root analyses are also enabled,
		including measures of external surface area and volumes for
		user-defined root size classes. For a detailed description of
		the application of computed tomography imaging for sediment
		characterization, see: Davey, E., C. Wigand, R. Johnson, K.
		Sundberg, J. Morris, and C. Roman. (2011) DOI:
