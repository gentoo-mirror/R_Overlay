		The Ball Mapper Algorithm // The core algorithm is described in
		"Ball mapper: a shape summary for topological data analysis" by
		Pawel Dlotko, (2019) arXiv:1901.07410. Ball Mapper provide a
		topologically accurate summary of a data in a form of an
		abstract graph. To create it, please provide the coordinates of
		points (in the points array), values of a function of interest
		at those points (can be initialized randomly if you do not have
		it) and the value epsilon which is the radius of the ball in
		the Ball Mapper construction. It can be understood as the
		minimal resolution on which we use to create the model of the
		data.
