		R Interface to the 'UNU.RAN' Random Variate Generators //
		Interface to the 'UNU.RAN' library for Universal Non-Uniform
		RANdom variate generators. Thus it allows to build non-uniform
		random number generators from quite arbitrary distributions. In
		particular, it provides an algorithm for fast numerical
		inversion for distribution with given density function. In
		addition, the package contains densities, distribution
		functions and quantiles from a couple of distributions.
