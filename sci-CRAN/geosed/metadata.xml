		Smallest Enclosing Disc for Latitude and Longitude Points // Find
		the smallest circle that contains all longitude and latitude
		input points. From the generated center and radius, variable
		side polygons can be created, navigation based on bearing and
		distance can be applied, and more. Based on a modified version
		of Welzl's algorithm for smallest circle. Distance calculations
		are based on the haversine formula. Calculations for distance,
		midpoint, bearing and more are derived from https://www
