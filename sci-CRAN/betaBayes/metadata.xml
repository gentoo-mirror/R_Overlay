		Bayesian Beta Regression // Provides a class of Bayesian beta
		regression models for the analysis of continuous data with
		support restricted to an unknown finite support. The response
		variable is modeled using a four-parameter beta distribution
		with the mean or mode parameter depending linearly on
		covariates through a link function. When the response support
		is known to be (0,1), the above class of models reduce to
		traditional (0,1) supported beta regression models. Model
		choice is carried out via the logarithm of the pseudo marginal
		likelihood (LPML), the deviance information criterion (DIC),
		and the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC). See Zhou
		and Huang (2022) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2021.107345.
