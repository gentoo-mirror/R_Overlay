		Interactive 'OpenAI' Model Integration in 'RStudio' // Offers an
		interactive 'RStudio' gadget interface for communicating with
		'OpenAI' large language models (e.g., 'gpt-5', 'gpt-5-mini',
		'gpt-5-nano') (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).
		Enables users to conduct multiple chat conversations
		simultaneously in separate tabs. Supports uploading local files
		(R, PDF, DOCX) to provide context for the models. Allows per-
		conversation configuration of system messages (where supported
		by the model). API interactions via the 'httr' package are
		performed asynchronously using 'promises' and 'future' to avoid
		blocking the R console. Useful for tasks like code generation,
		text summarization, and document analysis directly within the
		'RStudio' environment. Requires an 'OpenAI' API key set as an
		environment variable.
