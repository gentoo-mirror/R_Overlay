		Covariance Inference and Decompositions for Tensor Datasets // A
		collection of functions for Kronecker structured covariance
		estimation and testing under the array normal model. For
		estimation, maximum likelihood and Bayesian equivariant
		estimation procedures are implemented. For testing, a
		likelihood ratio testing procedure is available. This package
		also contains additional functions for manipulating and
		decomposing tensor data sets. This work was partially supported
		by NSF grant DMS-1505136. Details of the methods are described
		in Gerard and Hoff (2015) doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2015.01.020 and
		Gerard and Hoff (2016) doi:10.1016/j.laa.2016.04.033.
