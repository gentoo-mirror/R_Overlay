		Visualize the Results of Risk-of-Bias (ROB) Assessments // Helps
		users in quickly visualizing risk-of-bias assessments performed
		as part of a systematic review. It allows users to create
		weighted bar-plots of the distribution of risk-of-bias
		judgments within each bias domain, in addition to traffic-light
		plots of the specific domain-level judgments for each study.
		The resulting figures are of publication quality and are
		formatted according the risk-of-bias assessment tool use to
		perform the assessments. Currently, the supported tools are
		ROB2.0 (for randomized controlled trials; Sterne et al (2019)
		doi:10.1136/bmj.l4898), ROBINS-I (for non-randomised studies of
		interventions; Sterne et al (2016) doi:10.1136/bmj.i4919), and
		QUADAS-2 (for diagnostic accuracy studies; Whiting et al (2011)
		doi:10.7326/0003-4819-155-8-201110180-00009).
