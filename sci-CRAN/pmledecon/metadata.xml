		Deconvolution Density Estimation using Penalized MLE // Given a
		sample with additive measurement error, the package estimates
		the deconvolution density - that is, the density of the
		underlying distribution of the sample without measurement
		error. The method maximises the log-likelihood of the estimated
		density, plus a quadratic smoothness penalty. The distribution
		of the measurement error can be either a known family, or can
		be estimated from a "pure error" sample. For known error
		distributions, the package supports Normal, Laplace or Beta
		distributed error. For unknown error distribution, a pure error
		sample independent from the data is used.
