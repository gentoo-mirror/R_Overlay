		Weighted Linear Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal
		Inference // Provides a computationally efficient way of
		fitting weighted linear fixed effects estimators for causal
		inference with various weighting schemes. Weighted linear fixed
		effects estimators can be used to estimate the average
		treatment effects under different identification strategies.
		This includes stratified randomized experiments, matching and
		stratification for observational studies, first differencing,
		and difference-in-differences. The package implements methods
		described in Imai and Kim (2017) "When should We Use Linear
		Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal Inference with
		Longitudinal Data?", available at
		https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/FEmatch.html.
