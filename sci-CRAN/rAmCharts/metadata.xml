		JavaScript Charts Tool // Provides an R interface for using
		'AmCharts' Library. Based on 'htmlwidgets', it provides a
		global architecture to generate 'JavaScript' source code for
		charts. Most of classes in the library have their equivalent in
		R with S4 classes; for those classes, not all properties have
		been referenced but can easily be added in the constructors.
		Complex properties (e.g. 'JavaScript' object) can be passed as
		named list. See examples at https://datastorm-
		open.github.io/introduction_ramcharts/ and
		https://www.amcharts.com/ for more information about the
		library. The package includes the free version of 'AmCharts'
		Library. Its only limitation is a small link to the web site
		displayed on your charts. If you enjoy this library, do not
		hesitate to refer to this page https://www.amcharts.com/online-
		store/ to purchase a licence, and thus support its creators and
		get a period of Priority Support. See also
		https://www.amcharts.com/about/ for more information about
		'AmCharts' company.
