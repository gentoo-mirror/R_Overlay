		JavaScript Charts API Tool // API for using 'AmCharts' Library.
		Based on 'htmlwidgets', it provides a global architecture to
		generate 'JavaScript' source code for charts. Most of classes
		in the library have their equivalent in R with S4 classes; for
		those classes, not all properties have been referenced but can
		easily be added in the constructors. Complex properties (e.g.
		'JavaScript' object) can be passed as named list. See examples
		at http:// datastorm- open.github.io/introduction_ramcharts/.
		and http://www.amcharts.com/ for more information about the
		library. The package includes the free version of 'AmCharts'
		Library. Its only limitation is a small link to the web site
		displayed on your charts. If you enjoy this library, do not
		hesitate to refer to this page http://www.amcharts.com/online-
		store/ to purchase a licence, and thus support its creators and
		get a period of Priority Support. See also
		http://www.amcharts.com/about/ for more information about
		'AmCharts' company.
