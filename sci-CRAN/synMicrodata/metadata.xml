		Synthetic Microdata Generator // This tool fits a non-parametric
		Bayesian model called "hierarchically coupled mixture model
		(HCMM)" to the original microdata in order to generate
		synthetic microdata for privacy protection. The non-parametric
		feature of the adopted model is useful for catching the joint
		distribution of the original data in a highly flexible manner,
		leading to the generation of synthetic data very similar to the
		original data. Important reference papers on this method
		include Murray  Reiter (2016)
