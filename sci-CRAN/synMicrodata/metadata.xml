		Synthetic Microdata Generator // This tool fits a non-parametric
		Bayesian model called a "hierarchically coupled mixture model
		with local dependence (HCMM-LD)" to the original microdata in
		order to generate synthetic microdata for privacy protection.
		The non-parametric feature of the adopted model is useful for
		capturing the joint distribution of the original input data in
		a highly flexible manner, leading to the generation of
		synthetic data whose distributional features are similar to
		that of the input data. The package allows the original input
		data to have missing values and impute them with the posterior
		predictive distribution, so no missing values exist in the
		synthetic data output. The method builds on the work of Murray
		and Reiter (2016) doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1174132.
