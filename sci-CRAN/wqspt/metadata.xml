		Permutation Test for Weighted Quantile Sum Regression //
		Implements a permutation test method for the weighted quantile
		sum (WQS) regression, building off the 'gWQS' package (Renzetti
		et al. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gWQS). Weighted
		quantile sum regression is a statistical technique to evaluate
		the effect of complex exposure mixtures on an outcome (Carrico
		et al. 2015 doi:10.1007/s13253-014-0180-3). The model features
		a statistical power and Type I error (i.e., false positive)
		rate trade-off, as there is a machine learning step to
		determine the weights that optimize the linear model fit. This
		package provides an alternative method based on a permutation
		test that should reliably allow for both high power and low
		false positive rate when utilizing WQS regression (Day et al.
		2022 doi:10.1289/EHP10570).
