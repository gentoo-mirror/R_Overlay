		Diffusion Non-Additive Model with Tunable Precision // Performs
		Diffusion Non-Additive (DNA) model proposed by Heo, Boutelet,
		and Sung (2025+) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2506.08328 for multi-
		fidelity computer experiments with tuning parameters. The DNA
		model captures nonlinear dependencies across fidelity levels
		using Gaussian process priors and is particularly effective
		when simulations at different fidelity levels are nonlinearly
		correlated. The DNA model targets not only interpolation across
		given fidelity levels but also extrapolation to smaller tuning
		parameters including the exact solution corresponding to a
		zero-valued tuning parameter, leveraging a nonseparable
		covariance kernel structure that models interactions between
		the tuning parameter and input variables. Closed-form
		expressions for the predictive mean and variance enable
		efficient inference and uncertainty quantification.
		Hyperparameters in the model are estimated via maximum
		likelihood estimation.
