		Powerful 'SAS' Inspired Concepts for more Efficient Bigger
		Outputs // The main goal is to make descriptive evaluations
		easier to create bigger and more complex outputs in less time
		with less code. Introducing format containers with multilabels

		capable to output every possible combination of the provided
		grouping variables in one go https://documentation.sas.com/doc/

		c/n1ql5xnu0k3kdtn11gwa5hc7u435.htm and other more readable
		functions. The code is optimized to work fast even with
		datasets of over a million observations.
