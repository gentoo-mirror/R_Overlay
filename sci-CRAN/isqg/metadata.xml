		In Silico Quantitative Genetics // Accomplish high performance
		simulations in quantitative genetics. The molecular genetic
		components are represented by R6/C++ classes and methods. Mimic
		the meiosis recombination and de novo genetic variability by
		means a count-location process (Karlin  Liberman, 1978)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.75.12.6332. The core computational algorithm
		is implemented using 'Boost' dynamic bitsets (Schaling, 2014)
		[ISBN:978-1937434366]. A mix between low and high level
		interfaces provides great flexibility and allows user defined
		extensions and a wide range of applications.
