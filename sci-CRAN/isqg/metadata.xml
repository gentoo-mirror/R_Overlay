		In Silico Quantitative Genetics // Accomplish high performance
		simulations in quantitative genetics. The molecular genetic
		components are represented by R6/C++ classes and methods. The
		core computational algorithm is implemented using bitsets
		according to doi:10.1534/g3.119.400373. A mix between low and
		high level interfaces provides great flexibility and allows
		user defined extensions and a wide range of applications.
