		Estimating Speakers of Texts // Estimates the authors or speakers
		of texts. Methods developed in Huang, Perry, and Spirling
		(2020) doi:10.1017/pan.2019.49. The model is built on a
		Bayesian framework in which the distinctiveness of each speaker
		is defined by how different, on average, the speaker's terms
		are to everyone else in the corpus of texts. An optional cross-
		validation method is implemented to select the subset of terms
		that generate the most accurate speaker predictions. Once a set
		of terms is selected, the model can be estimated. Speaker
		distinctiveness and term influence can be recovered from
		parameters in the model using package functions. Once fitted,
		the model can be used to predict authorship of new texts.
