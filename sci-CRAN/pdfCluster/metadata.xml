		Cluster Analysis via Nonparametric Density Estimation // Cluster
		analysis via nonparametric density estimation is performed.
		Operationally, the kernel method is used throughout to estimate
		the density. Diagnostics methods for evaluating the quality of
		the clustering are available. The package includes also a
		routine to estimate the probability density function obtained
		by the kernel method, given a set of data with arbitrary
		dimensions.
