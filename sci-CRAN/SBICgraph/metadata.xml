		Structural Bayesian Information Criterion for Graphical Models //
		This is the implementation of the novel structural Bayesian
		information criterion by Zhou, 2020 (under review). In this
		method, the prior structure is modeled and incorporated into
		the Bayesian information criterion framework. Additionally, we
		also provide the implementation of a two-step algorithm to
		generate the candidate model pool.
