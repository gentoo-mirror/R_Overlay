		A Framework for Creating, Managing and Training Multiple Caret
		Models // A minimalistic but flexible framework that
		facilitates the creation, management and training of multiple
		'caret' models. A model grid consists of two components: (1) a
		set of settings that is shared by all models by default, and
		(2) specifications that apply only to the individual models.
		When the model grid is trained, model and training
		specifications are first consolidated from the shared and the
		model specific settings into complete 'caret' model
		configurations. These models are then trained with the 'train'
		function from the 'caret' package.
