		Randomer Forest // Random Forester (RerF) is an algorithm
		developed by Tomita (2016) arXiv:1506.03410v2 which is similar
		to Random Forest - Random Combination (Forest-RC) developed by
		Breiman (2001) doi:10.1023/A:1010933404324.  Random Forests
		create axis-parallel, or orthogonal trees. That is, the feature
		space is recursively split along directions parallel to the
		axes of the feature space. Thus, in cases in which the classes
		seem inseparable along any single dimension, Random Forests may
		be suboptimal.  To address this, Breiman also proposed and
		characterized Forest-RC, which uses linear combinations of
		coordinates rather than individual coordinates, to split along.
		This package, 'rerf', implements RerF which is similar to
		Forest-RC.  The difference between the two algorithms is where
		the random linear combinations occur: Forest-RC combines
		features at the per tree level whereas RerF takes linear
		combinations of coordinates at every node in the tree.
