		R-Squared Measures for Multilevel Models // Generates both total-
		and level-specific R-squared measures from Rights and Sterbas
		(2019) doi:10.1037/met0000184 framework of R-squared measures
		for multilevel models with random intercepts and/or slopes,
		which is based on a complete decomposition of variance.
		Additionally generates graphical representations of these
		R-squared measures to allow visualizing and interpreting all
		measures in the framework together as an integrated set. This
		framework subsumes 10 previously-developed R-squared measures
		for multilevel models as special cases of 5 measures from the
		framework, and it also includes several newly-developed
		measures. Measures in the framework can be used to compute
		R-squared differences when comparing multilevel models
		(following procedures in Rights  Sterba (2020)
		doi:10.1080/00273171.2019.1660605).
