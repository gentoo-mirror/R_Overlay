		Convert Antipsychotic Doses to Chlorpromazine Equivalents // As
		different antipsychotic medications have different potencies,
		the doses of different medications cannot be directly compared.
		Various strategies are used to convert doses into a common
		reference so that comparison is meaningful. Chlorpromazine
		(CPZ) has historically been used as a reference medication into
		which other antipsychotic doses can be converted, as
		"chlorpromazine-equivalent doses". Using conversion keys
		generated from widely-cited scientific papers, e.g. Gardner et.
		al 2010 doi:10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09060802 and Leucht et al.
		2016 doi:10.1093/schbul/sbv167, antipsychotic doses are
		converted to CPZ (or any specified antipsychotic) equivalents.
		The use of the package is described in the included vignette.
		Not for clinical use.
