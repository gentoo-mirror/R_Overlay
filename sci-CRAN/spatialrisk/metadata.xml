		Calculating Spatial Risk // Provides methods for spatial risk
		calculations, focusing on efficient determination of the sum of
		observations within a circle of a given radius. These methods
		are particularly relevant for applications such as insurance,
		where recent European Commission regulations require the
		calculation of the maximum insured value of fire risk policies
		for all buildings that are partly or fully located within a 200
		m radius. The underlying problem is described by Church (1974)
		doi:10.1007/BF01942293.
