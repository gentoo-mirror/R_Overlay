		calculations. It offers an efficient approach to determine the
		sum of all observations within a circle of a certain radius.
		This might be beneficial for insurers who are required (by a
		recent European Commission regulation) to determine the maximum
		value of insured fire risk policies of all buildings that are
		partly or fully located within a circle of a radius of 200m.
