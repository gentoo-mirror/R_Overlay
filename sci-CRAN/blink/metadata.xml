		Record Linkage for Empirically Motivated Priors // An
		implementation of the model in Steorts (2015)
		DOI:10.1214/15-BA965SI, which performs Bayesian entity
		resolution for categorical and text data, for any distance
		function defined by the user. In addition, the precision and
		recall are in the package to allow one to compare to any other
		comparable method such as logistic regression, Bayesian
		additive regression trees (BART), or random forests. The
		experiments are reproducible and illustrated using a simple
		vignette.
