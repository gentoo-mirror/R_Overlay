		Multivariate Weather-State Approach Conditionally Skew-Normal
		Generator // A multivariate weather generator for daily climate
		variables based on weather-states (Flecher et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1029/2009WR008098). It uses a Markov chain for modeling
		the succession of weather states. Conditionally to the weather
		states, the multivariate variables are modeled using the family
		of Complete Skew-Normal distributions. Parameters are estimated
		on measured series. Must include the variable 'Rain' and can
		accept as many other variables as desired.
