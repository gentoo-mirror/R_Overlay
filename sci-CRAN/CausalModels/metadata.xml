		Causal Inference Modeling for Estimation of Causal Effects //
		Provides an array of statistical models common in causal
		inference such as standardization, IP weighting, propensity
		matching, outcome regression, and doubly-robust estimators.
		Estimates of the average treatment effects from each model are
		given with the standard error and a 95% Wald confidence
		interval (Hernan, Robins (2020)
		https://miguelhernan.org/whatifbook/).
