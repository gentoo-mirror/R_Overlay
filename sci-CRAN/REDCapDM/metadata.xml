		'REDCap' Data Management // Access and manage 'REDCap' data.
		'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data CAPture;
		https://projectredcap.org) is a web application for building
		and managing online surveys and databases developed at
		Vanderbilt University. The API allows users to programmatic
		access data and project meta data (such as the data dictionary)
		from the web. This package allows us to read 'REDCap' data,
		exported or using an API connection, identify missing or
		extreme values, identify missing 'REDCap' events in each
		observation, do a follow-up of the queries initially identified
		and it also facilitates the process of data management.
