		Localization Processes for Functional Data Analysis //
		Implementation of a theoretically supported alternative to
		k-nearest neighbors for functional data to solve problems of
		estimating unobserved segments of a partially observed
		functional data sample, functional classification and outlier
		detection. The approximating neighbor curves are piecewise
		functions built from a functional sample. Instead of a distance
		on a function space we use a locally defined distance function
		that satisfies stabilization criteria. The package allows the
		implementation of the methodology and the replication of the
		results in Elas, A., Jimnez, R. and Yukich, J. (2020)
		arXiv:2007.16059.
