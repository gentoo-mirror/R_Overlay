		Nearest Neighbor Observation Imputation and Evaluation Tools //
		Performs nearest neighbor-based imputation using one or more
		alternative approaches to processing multivariate data. These
		include methods based on canonical correlation: analysis,
		canonical correspondence analysis, and a multivariate
		adaptation of the random forest classification and regression
		techniques of Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler. Additional methods
		are also offered. The package includes functions for comparing
		the results from running alternative techniques, detecting
		imputation targets that are notably distant from reference
		observations, detecting and correcting for bias, bootstrapping
		and building ensemble imputations, and mapping results.
