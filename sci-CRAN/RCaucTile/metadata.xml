		Tile Grid Maps for East Caucasian Languages // Generates tile
		maps for the East Caucasian language family, inspired by the
		Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD,
		https://lingconlab.ru/tald/). It leverages 'ggplot2' to create
		visually informative maps, displaying rectangles for each
		language and allowing for color-coding based on linguistic
		features. The package includes a built-in dataset of 56
		languages and the template for their distribution and provides
		flexibility to customize the tile map's appearance. The default
		template can be modified via the ability to hide or rename
		languages.  It's designed to be used with external data tables
		containing language information and features, offering a tool
		for visualizing the geographic distribution and linguistic
		characteristics of East Caucasian languages.
