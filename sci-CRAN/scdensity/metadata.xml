		Shape-Constrained Kernel Density Estimation // Implements methods
		for obtaining kernel density estimates subject to a variety of
		shape constraints (unimodality, bimodality, symmetry, tail
		monotonicity, bounds, and constraints on the number of
		inflection points). Enforcing constraints can eliminate
		unwanted waves or kinks in the estimate, which improves its
		subjective appearance and can also improve statistical
		performance. The main function scdensity() is very similar to
		the density() function in 'stats', allowing shape-restricted
		estimates to be obtained with little effort. The methods
		implemented in this package are described in Wolters and Braun
