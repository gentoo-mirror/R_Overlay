		Isolate-Detect Methodology for Multiple Change-Point Detection //
		Provides efficient implementation of the Isolate-Detect
		methodology for the consistent estimation of the number and
		location of multiple change-points in one-dimensional data
		sequences from the "deterministic + noise" model. For details
		on the Isolate-Detect methodology, please see Anastasiou and
		Fryzlewicz (2018) https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/24cdcc_6a0866c
		574654163b8255e272bc0001b.pdf. Currently implemented scenarios
		are: piecewise-constant signal with Gaussian noise, piecewise-
		constant signal with heavy-tailed noise, continuous piecewise-
		linear signal with Gaussian noise, continuous piecewise-linear
		signal with heavy-tailed noise.
