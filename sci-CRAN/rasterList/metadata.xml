		A Raster Where Cells are Generic Objects // A S4 class has been
		created such that complex operations can be executed on each
		cells of a raster map. The raster of objects contains the
		traditional raster map with the addition of a list of generic
		objects: one object for each raster cells. It allows to write
		few lines of R code for complex map algebra. Two environmental
		applications about frequency analysis of raster map of
		precipitation and creation of a raster map of soil water
		retention curves have been presented.
