		Trees and Traits Simulations // A modular package for simulating
		phylogenetic trees and species traits jointly. Trees can be
		simulated using modular birth-death parameters (e.g. changing
		starting parameters or algorithm rules). Traits can be
		simulated in any way designed by the user. The growth of the
		tree and the traits can influence each other through modifiers
		objects providing rules for affecting each other. Finally,
		events can be created to modify both the tree and the traits
		under specific conditions.
