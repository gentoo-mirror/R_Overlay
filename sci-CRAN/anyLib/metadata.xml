		Install and Load Any Package from CRAN, Bioconductor or Github //
		Made to make your life simpler with packages, by installing and
		loading a list of packages, whether they are on CRAN,
		Bioconductor or github. For github, if you do not have the full
		path, with the maintainer name in it (e.g.
		"achateigner/topReviGO"), it will be able to load it but not to
		install it.
