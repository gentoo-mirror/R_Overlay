		developed by John Tukey: FUNOP (FUll NOrmal Plot), FUNOR-FUNOM
		(FUll NOrmal Rejection-FUll NOrmal Modification), and vacuum
		cleaner. Combined, they provide a way to identify, treat, and
		analyze outliers in two-way (i.e., contingency) tables, as
		described in his landmark paper "The Future of Data Analysis",
