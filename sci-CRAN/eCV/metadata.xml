		Enhanced Coefficient of Variation and IDR Extensions for
		Reproducibility Assessment // Reproducibility assessment is
		essential in extracting reliable scientific insights from high-
		throughput experiments.  While  the  Irreproducibility
		Discovery   Rate   (IDR)   method  has  been  instrumental  in
		assessing reproducibility,  its  standard implementation is
		constrained to handling only two  replicates. Package 'eCV'
		introduces an enhanced Coefficient of Variation  (eCV)  metric
		to assess the likelihood of omic features being reproducible.
		Additionally, it offers alternatives  to  the  Irreproducible
		Discovery  Rate  (IDR)  calculations for multi-replicate
		experiments. These  tools  are  valuable for analyzing high-
		throughput data in genomics and  other  omics  fields. The
		methods implemented in 'eCV' are  described in Gonzalez-
		Reymundez et al., (2023) doi:10.1101/2023.12.18.572208.
