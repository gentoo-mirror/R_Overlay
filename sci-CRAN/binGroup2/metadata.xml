		Identification and Estimation using Group Testing // Methods for
		the group testing identification problem: 1) Operating
		characteristics (e.g., expected number of tests) for commonly
		used hierarchical and array-based algorithms, and 2) Optimal
		testing configurations for these same algorithms. Methods for
		the group testing estimation problem: 1) Estimation and
		inference procedures for an overall prevalence, and 2)
		Regression modeling for commonly used hierarchical and array-
		based algorithms.
