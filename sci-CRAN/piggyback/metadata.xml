		Managing Larger Data on a GitHub Repository // Because larger (
		50 MB) data files cannot easily be committed to git, a
		different approach is required to manage data associated with
		an analysis in a GitHub repository.  This package provides a
		simple work-around by allowing larger (up to 2 GB) data files
		to piggyback on a repository as assets attached to individual
		GitHub releases.  These files are not handled by git in any
		way, but instead are uploaded, downloaded, or edited directly
		by calls through the GitHub API. These data files can be
		versioned manually by creating different releases.  This
		approach works equally well with public or private
		repositories.  Data can be uploaded and downloaded
		programmatically from scripts. No authentication is required to
		download data from public repositories.
