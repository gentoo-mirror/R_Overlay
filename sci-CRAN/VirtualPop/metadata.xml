		Simulation of Populations by Sampling Waiting-Time Distributions
		// Constructs a virtual population from fertility and mortality
		rates for any country, calendar year and birth cohort in the
		Human Mortality Database https://www.mortality.org and the
		Human Fertility Database https://www.humanfertility.org.
		Fertility histories are simulated for every individual and
		their offspring, producing a multi-generation virtual
		population.
