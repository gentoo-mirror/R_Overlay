		Simulation of Populations by Sampling Waiting-Time Distributions
		// Generates lifespans and fertility histories in continuous
		time using individual-level state transition (multi-state)
		models and data from the Human Mortality Database and the Human
		Fertility Database. To facilitate virtual population analysis,
		data on virtual individuals are stored in a data structure
		commonly used in sample surveys. Life histories are generated
		for multiple generations. The genealogies that result
		facilitate the study of family ties.
