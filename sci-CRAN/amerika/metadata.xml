		American Politics-Inspired Color Palette Generator // A color
		palette generator inspired by American politics, with colors
		ranging from blue on the left to gray in the middle and red on
		the right. A variety of palettes allow for a range of
		applications from brief discrete scales (e.g., three colors for
		Democrats, Independents, and Republicans) to continuous
		interpolated arrays including dozens of shades graded from blue
		(left) to red (right). This package greatly benefitted from
		building on the source code (with permission) from Ram and
		Wickham (2015).
