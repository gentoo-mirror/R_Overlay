		Linear Specification Testing // Tests whether the linear
		hypothesis of a model is correct specified using Dominguez-
		Lobato test. Also Ramsey's RESET (Regression Equation
		Specification Error Test) test is implemented and Wald tests
		can be carried out. Although RESET test is widely used to test
		the linear hypothesis of a model, Dominguez and Lobato (2019)
		proposed a novel approach that generalizes well known
		specification tests such as Ramsey's. This test relies on wild-
		bootstrap; this package implements this approach to be usable
		with any function that fits linear models and is compatible
		with the update() function such as 'stats'::lm(), 'lfe'::felm()
		and 'forecast'::Arima(), for ARMA (autoregressivemoving-
		average) models. Also the package can handle custom statistics
		such as Cramer von Mises and Kolmogorov Smirnov, described by
		the authors, and custom distributions such as Mammen (discrete
		and continuous) and Rademacher. Manuel A. Dominguez  Ignacio N.
