		Tabular Data Suppression using Gaussian Elimination // A
		statistical disclosure control tool to protect tables by
		suppression using the Gaussian elimination secondary
		suppression algorithm (Langsrud, 2024)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-031-69651-0_6. A suggestion is to start by
		working with functions SuppressSmallCounts() and
		SuppressDominantCells(). These functions use primary
		suppression functions for the minimum frequency rule and the
		dominance rule, respectively. Novel functionality for
		suppression of disclosive cells is also included. General
		primary suppression functions can be supplied as input to the
		general working horse function, GaussSuppressionFromData().
		Suppressed frequencies can be replaced by synthetic decimal
		numbers as described in Langsrud (2019)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9848-9.
