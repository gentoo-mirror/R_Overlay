		Interface for Multiple Data Providers 'EDDS' and 'FRED' //
		Interface for multiple data sources, such as the 'EDDS' API
		https://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/index.php?/evds/userDocs of the
		Central Bank of the Republic of Trkiye and the 'FRED' API
		https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/ of the Federal
		Reserve Bank. Both data providers require API keys for access,
		which users can easily obtain by creating accounts on their
		respective websites. The package provides caching ability with
		the selection of periods to increase the speed and efficiency
		of requests. It combines datasets requested from different
		sources, helping users when the data has common frequencies.
		While combining data frames whenever possible, it also keeps
		all requested data available as separate data frames to
		increase efficiency.
