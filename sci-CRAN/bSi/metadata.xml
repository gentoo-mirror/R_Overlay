		Modeling and Computing Biogenic Silica ('bSi') from Inland and
		Pelagic Sediments // A collection of integrated tools designed
		to seamlessly interact with each other for the analysis of
		biogenic silica 'bSi' in inland and marine sediments. These
		tools share common data representations and follow a consistent
		'API' design. The primary goal of the 'bSi' package is to
		simplify the installation process, facilitate data loading, and
		enable the analysis of multiple samples for biogenic silica
		fluxes. This package is designed to enhance the efficiency and
		coherence of the entire 'bSi' analytic workflow, from data
		loading to model construction and visualization tailored
		towards reconstructing productivity in aquatic ecosystems.
