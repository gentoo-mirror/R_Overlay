		Parametric Time-to-Event Analysis with Variable Incubation Phases
		// Fit parametric models for time-to-event data that show an
		initial 'incubation period', i.e., a variable delay phase where
		the hazard is zero. The delayed Weibull distribution serves as
		foundational data model. The specific method of 'MPSE' (maximum
		product of spacings estimation) and MLE-based methods are used
		for parameter estimation. Bootstrap confidence intervals for
		parameters and significance tests in a two group setting are
		provided.
