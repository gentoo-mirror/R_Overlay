		Positron Emission Tomography Time-Activity Curve Analysis // To
		facilitate the analysis of positron emission tomography (PET)
		time activity curve (TAC) data, and to encourage open science
		and replicability, this package supports data loading and
		analysis of multiple TAC file formats. Functions are available
		to analyze loaded TAC data for individual participants or in
		batches. Major functionality includes weighted TAC merging by
		region of interest (ROI), calculating models including
		standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume
		ratio (DVR, Logan et al. 1996
		doi:10.1097/00004647-199609000-00008), basic plotting functions
		and calculation of cut-off values (Aizenstein et al. 2008
		doi:10.1001/archneur.65.11.1509). Please see the walkthrough
		vignette for a detailed overview of 'tacmagic' functions.
