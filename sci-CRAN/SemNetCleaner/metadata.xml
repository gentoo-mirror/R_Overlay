		An Automated Cleaning Tool for Semantic and Linguistic Data //
		Implements several functions that automates the cleaning and
		spell-checking of text data. Also converges, finalizes, removes
		plurals and continuous strings, and puts text data in binary
		format for semantic network analysis. Uses the
		'SemNetDictionaries' package to make the cleaning process more
		accurate, efficient, and reproducible.
