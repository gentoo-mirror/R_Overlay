		Computation of the Sparse Inverse Subset // Creates a wrapper for
		the 'SuiteSparse' routines that execute the Takahashi
		equations. These equations compute the elements of the inverse
		of a sparse matrix at locations where the its Cholesky factor
		is structurally non-zero. The resulting matrix is known as a
		sparse inverse subset. Some helper functions are also
		implemented. Support for spam matrices is currently limited and
		will be implemented in the future. See Rue and Martino (2007)
		doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2006.07.016 and Zammit-Mangion and Rougier
		(2018) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2018.02.001 for the application of
		these equations to statistics.
