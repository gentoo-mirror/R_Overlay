		Lightweight but Feature Complete Unit Testing Framework //
		Provides a lightweight (zero-dependency) and easy to use unit
		testing framework. Main features: install tests with the
		package. Test results are treated as data that can be stored
		and manipulated. Test files are R scripts interspersed with
		test commands, that can be programmed over. Fully automated
		build-install-test sequence for packages. Skip tests when not
		run locally (e.g. on CRAN). Flexible and configurable output
		printing. Compare computed output with output stored with the
		package.
