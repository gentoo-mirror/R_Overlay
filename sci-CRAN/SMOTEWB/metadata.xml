		Imbalanced Resampling using SMOTE with Boosting // Provides
		Random Oversampling, Random Undersampling, Synthetic
		Oversampling Minority Technique and SMOTE with Boosting by
		Saglam and Cengiz (2022) doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117023 for
		imbalanced data resampling. SMOTE with Boosting is a SMOTE-
		based oversampling method which can determine the number of
		links for each positive sample and robust to noise.
