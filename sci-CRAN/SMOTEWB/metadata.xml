		Imbalanced Resampling using SMOTE with Boosting (SMOTEWB) //
		Provides the SMOTE with Boosting (SMOTEWB) algorithm. See F.
		Salam, M. A. Cengiz (2022) doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117023. It
		is a SMOTE-based resampling technique which creates synthetic
		data on the links between nearest neighbors. SMOTEWB uses
		boosting weights to determine where to generate new samples and
		automatically decides the number of neighbors for each sample.
		It is robust to noise and outperforms most of the alternatives
		according to Matthew Correlation Coefficient metric.
		Alternative resampling methods are also available in the
		package.
