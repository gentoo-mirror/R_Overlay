		Fire Scars, Severity and Regeneration Mapping Using 'Otsu'
		Thresholding // Tools to segment fire scars and assess severity
		and vegetation regeneration using 'Otsu' thresholding on
		Relative Burn Ratio (RBR) and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio
		(dNBR) image composites. Includes support for mosaic handling,
		polygon metrics, post-fire regeneration detection, day-of-year
		flagging, and validation against reference datasets. Designed
		for analysis of fire history in the Iberian Peninsula. Input
		Landsat composites follow the methodology described in Quintero
		et al. (2025) doi:10.2139/ssrn.4929831.
