		Cumulative Percent Decay Curve Generator // Calculates and
		visualises cumulative percent 'decay' curves, which are
		typically calculated from metagenomic taxonomic profiles. These
		can be used to estimate the level of expected 'endogenous' taxa
		at different abundance levels retrieved from metagenomic
		samples, when comparing to samples of known sampling site or
		source.
