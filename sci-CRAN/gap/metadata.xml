		Genetic Analysis Package // As first reported [Zhao, J. H. 2007.
		"gap: Genetic Analysis Package". J Stat Soft 23(8):1-18.
		doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i08], it is designed as an integrated
		package for genetic data analysis of both population and family
		data. Currently, it contains functions for sample size
		calculations of both population-based and family-based designs,
		probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship
		calculation, statistics in linkage analysis, and association
		analysis involving genetic markers including haplotype analysis
		with or without environmental covariates. Over years, the
		package has been developed in-between many projects hence also
		in line with the name (gap).
