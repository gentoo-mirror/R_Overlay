		Penalised Multivariate Regression ('Multi-Target Learning') //
		Implements penalised multivariate regression (i.e., for
		multiple outcomes and many features) by stacked generalisation
		(doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab576). For positively correlated
		outcomes, a single multivariate regression is typically more
		predictive than multiple univariate regressions. Includes
		functions for model fitting, extracting coefficients, outcome
		prediction, and performance measurement. For optional
		comparisons, install 'remMap' from GitHub
		(https://github.com/cran/remMap).
