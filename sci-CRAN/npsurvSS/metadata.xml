		Sample Size and Power Calculation for Common Non-Parametric Tests
		in Survival Analysis // A number of statistical tests have been
		proposed to compare two survival curves, including the
		difference in (or ratio of) t-year survival, difference in (or
		ratio of) p-th percentile survival, difference in (or ratio of)
		restricted mean survival time, and the weighted log-rank test.
		Despite the multitude of options, the convention in survival
		studies is to assume proportional hazards and to use the
		unweighted log-rank test for design and analysis. This package
		provides sample size and power calculation for all of the above
		statistical tests with allowance for flexible accrual,
		censoring, and survival (eg. Weibull, piecewise-exponential,
		mixture cure). It is the companion R package to the paper by
		Yung and Liu (2020) doi:10.1111/biom.13196. Specific to the
		weighted log-rank test, users may specify which approximations
		they wish to use to estimate the large-sample mean and
		variance. The default option has been shown to provide
		substantial improvement over the conventional sample size and
		power equations based on Schoenfeld (1981)
