		Multi-Set Split Feasibility // An implementation of the
		majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm introduced by Xu, Chi,
		Yang, and Lange (2017) arXiv:1612.05614 for solving multi-set
		split feasibility problems. In the multi-set split feasibility
		problem, we seek to find a point x in the intersection of
		multiple closed sets and whose image under a mapping also must
		fall in the intersection of several closed sets.
