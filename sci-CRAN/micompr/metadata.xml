		Multivariate Independent Comparison of Observations // A
		procedure for comparing multivariate samples associated with
		different groups. It uses principal component analysis to
		convert multivariate observations into a set of linearly
		uncorrelated statistical measures, which are then compared
		using a number of statistical methods. The procedure is
		independent of the distributional properties of samples and
		automatically selects features that best explain their
		differences, avoiding manual selection of specific points or
		summary statistics. It is appropriate for comparing samples of
		time series, images, spectrometric measures or similar
		multivariate observations. This package is described in Fachada
		et al. (2016) doi:10.32614/RJ-2016-055.
