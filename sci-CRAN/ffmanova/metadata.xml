		Fifty-Fifty MANOVA // General linear modeling with multiple
		responses (MANCOVA). An overall p-value for each model term is
		calculated by the 50-50 MANOVA method by Langsrud (2002)
		doi:10.1111/1467-9884.00320, which handles collinear responses.
		Rotation testing, described by Langsrud (2005)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-005-4789-5, is used to compute adjusted
		single response p-values according to familywise error rates
		and false discovery rates (FDR). The approach to FDR is
		described in the appendix of Moen et al. (2005)
		doi:10.1128/AEM.71.4.2086-2094.2005. Unbalanced designs are
		handled by Type II sums of squares as argued in Langsrud (2003)
		doi:10.1023/A:1023260610025. Furthermore, the Type II
		philosophy is extended to continuous design variables as
		described in Langsrud et al. (2007)
		doi:10.1080/02664760701594246. This means that the method is
		invariant to scale changes and that common pitfalls are
		avoided.
