		Fifty-Fifty MANOVA // General linear modeling with multiple
		responses (MANCOVA).  An overall p-value for each model term is
		calculated by the 50-50 MANOVA method, which handles collinear
		responses.  Rotation testing is used to compute adjusted single
		response p-values according to familywise error rates and false
		discovery rates.
