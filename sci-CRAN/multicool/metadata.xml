		Permutations of Multisets in Cool-Lex Order // A set of tools to
		permute multisets without loops or hash tables and to generate
		integer partitions. The permutation functions are based on C
		code from Aaron Williams. Cool-lex order is similar to
		colexicographical order. The algorithm is described in
		Williams, A. (2009)  DOI:10.1145/1496770.1496877 Loopless
		Generation of Multiset Permutations by Prefix Shifts. Symposium
		on Discrete Algorithms, New York, United States. The
		permutation code is distributed without restrictions. The code
		for stable and efficient computation of multinomial
		coefficients comes from Dave Barber. The code can be download
		from http://tamivox.org/dave/multinomial/code.html and is
		distributed without conditions. The package also generates the
		integer partitions of a positive, non-zero integer n. The C++
		code for this is based on Python code from Jerome Kelleher
		which can be found here http://jeromekelleher.net/tag/integer-
		partitions.html. The C++ code and Python code are distributed
		without conditions.
