		Permutations of Multisets in Cool-Lex Order // A set of tools to
		permute multisets without loops or hash tables and to generate
		integer partitions. The permutation functions are based on C
		code from Aaron Williams. Cool-lex order is similar to
		colexicographical order. The algorithm is described in
		Williams, A. Loopless Generation of Multiset Permutations by
		Prefix Shifts. SODA 2009, Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, New
		York, United States. The permutation code is distributed
		without restrictions. The code for stable and efficient
		computation of multinomial coefficients comes from Dave Barber.
		The code can be download from
		http://home.comcast.net/~tamivox/dave/multinomial/index.html
		and is distributed without conditions. The package also
		generates the integer partitions of a positive, non-zero
		integer n. The C++ code for this is based on Python code from
		Jerome Kelleher which can be found here
		http://jeromekelleher.net/partitions.php. The C++ code and
		Python code are distributed without conditions.
