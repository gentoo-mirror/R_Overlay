		Permutations of Multisets in Cool-Lex Order // A set of tools to
		permute multisets without loops or hash tables and to generate
		integer partitions. The permutation functions are based on C
		code from Aaron Williams. Cool-lex order is similar to
		colexicographical order. The algorithm is described in
		Williams, A. Loopless Generation of Multiset Permutations by
		Prefix Shifts. SODA 2009, Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, New
		York, United States. The permutation code is distributed
		without restrictions. The code for stable and efficient
		computation of multinomial coefficients comes from Dave Barber.
		The code can be download from
		http://tamivox.org/dave/multinomial/index.html and is
		distributed without conditions. The package also generates the
		integer partitions of a positive, non-zero integer n. The C++
		code for this is based on Python code from Jerome Kelleher
		which can be found here
		https://jeromekelleher.net/category/combinatorics.html. The C++
		code and Python code are distributed without conditions.
