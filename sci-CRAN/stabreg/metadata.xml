		Linear Regression with the Stable Distribution // Efficient
		regression for heavy-tailed and skewed data following a stable
		distribution. Generalized regression where the skewness and
		tail parameter of residuals are dependent on regressors is also
		available. Includes fast calculation of stable densities.
		Calculation of densities is based on efficient numerical
		methods from Ament and O'Neil (2017)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9725-y. Parts of the code have been
		ported to C from Ament's 'Matlab' code available at
		https://gitlab.com/s_ament/qastable.
