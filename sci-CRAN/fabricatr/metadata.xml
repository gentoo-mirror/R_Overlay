		Imagine Your Data Before You Collect It // Helps you imagine your
		data before you collect it. Hierarchical data structures and
		correlated data can be easily simulated, either from random
		number generators or by resampling from existing data sources.
		This package is faster with 'data.table' and 'mvnfast'
		installed.
