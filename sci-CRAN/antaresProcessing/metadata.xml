		'Antares', a powerful open source software developed by RTE
		(Rseau de Transport dlectricit) to simulate and study electric
		power systems (more information about 'Antares' here:
		https://github.com/AntaresSimulatorTeam/Antares_Simulator). You
		can see the results of several ANTARES studies here :

		functions to create new columns like net load, load factors,
		upward and downward margins or to compute aggregated statistics
		like economic surpluses of consumers, producers and sectors.
