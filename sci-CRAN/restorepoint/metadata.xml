		Debugging with Restore Points // Debugging with restore points
		instead of break points. A restore point stores all local
		variables when called inside a function. The stored values can
		later be retrieved and evaluated in a modified R console that
		replicates the function's environment. To debug step by step,
		one can simply copy  paste the function body from the R script.
		Particularly convenient in combination with "RStudio". See the
		"Github" page inst/vignettes for a tutorial.
