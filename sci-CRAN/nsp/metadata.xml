		Inference for Multiple Change-Points in Linear Models //
		Implementation of Narrowest Significance Pursuit, a general and
		flexible methodology for automatically detecting localised
		regions in data sequences which each must contain a change-
		point (understood as an abrupt change in the parameters of an
		underlying linear model), at a prescribed global significance
		level. Narrowest Significance Pursuit works with a wide range
		of distributional assumptions on the errors, and yields exact
		desired finite-sample coverage probabilities, regardless of the
		form or number of the covariates. For details, see P.
