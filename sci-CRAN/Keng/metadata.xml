		Knock Errors Off Nice Guesses // Miscellaneous functions and data
		used in Qingyao's psychological research and teaching. Keng
		currently has a built-in dataset depress, and could (1) scale a
		vector, (2) test the significance and compute the cut-off
		values of Pearson's r without raw data, (3) compare lm()'s
		fitted outputs using R-squared, f_squared, post-hoc power, and
		PRE (Proportional Reduction in Error, also called partial
		R-squared or partial Eta-squared). (4) Calculate PRE from
		partial correlation, Cohen's f, or f_squared. (5) Compute the
		post-hoc power for one or a set of predictors in regression
		analysis without raw data, (6) Plan the sample size for one or
		a set of predictors in regression analysis.
