		Knock Errors Off Nice Guesses // Miscellaneous functions and data
		used in psychological research and teaching. Keng currently has
		a built-in dataset depress, and could (1) scale a vector; (2)
		compute the cut-off values of Pearson's r with known sample
		size; (3) test the significance and compute the post-hoc power
		for Pearson's r with known sample size; (4) conduct prior power
		analysis and plan the sample size for Pearson's r; (5) compare
		lm()'s fitted outputs using R-squared, f_squared, post-hoc
		power, and PRE (Proportional Reduction in Error, also called
		partial R-squared or partial Eta-squared); (6) calculate PRE
		from partial correlation, Cohen's f, or f_squared; (7) conduct
		prior power analysis and plan the sample size for one or a set
		of predictors in regression analysis; (8) conduct post-hoc
		power analysis for one or a set of predictors in regression
		analysis with known sample size.
