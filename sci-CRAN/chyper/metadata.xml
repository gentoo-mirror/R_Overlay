		Functions for Conditional Hypergeometric Distributions // An
		implementation of the probability mass function, cumulative
		density function, quantile function, random number generator,
		maximum likelihood estimator, and p-value generator from a
		conditional hypergeometric distribution: the distribution of
		how many items are in the overlap of all samples when samples
		of arbitrary size are each taken without replacement from
		populations of arbitrary size.
