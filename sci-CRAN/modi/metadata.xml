		Multivariate Outlier Detection and Imputation for Incomplete
		Survey Data // Algorithms for multivariate outlier detection
		when missing values occur. Algorithms are based on Mahalanobis
		distance or data depth. Imputation is based on the multivariate
		normal model or uses nearest neighbour donors. The algorithms
		take sample designs, in particular weighting, into account. The
		methods are described in Bill and Hulliger (2016)
