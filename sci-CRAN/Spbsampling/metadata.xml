		Spatially Balanced Samples // Provides functions to draw
		spatially balanced samples. It contains fast implementations
		(C++ via 'Rcpp') of the included sampling methods. In
		particular, the algorithms to draw spatially balanced samples
		are pwd() and swd(). These methods use a probability
		distribution, proportional to the within sample distance. See
		Benedetti R and Piersimoni F (2017) doi:10.1002/bimj.201600194
		for details. Moreover, there is a function hpwd(), which is a
		heuristic method to achieve approximated samples obtained by
		pwd() in a faster way. See Benedetti R and Piersimoni F (2017)
		arXiv:1710.09116 for details. Finally, there are two functions,
		stprod() and stsum(), useful to standardize distance matrices
		in order to achieve fixed sample size using, respectively, the
		functions pwd() and swd().
