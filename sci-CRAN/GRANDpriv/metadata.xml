		Graph Release with Assured Node Differential Privacy //
		Implements a novel method for privatizing network data using
		differential privacy. Provides functions for generating
		synthetic networks based on LSM (Latent Space Model), applying
		differential privacy to network latent positions to achieve
		overall network privatization, and evaluating the utility of
		privatized networks through various network statistics. The
		privatize and evaluate functions support both LSM and RDPG
		(Random Dot Product Graph). For generating RDPG networks, users
		are encouraged to use the 'randnet' package
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randnet. For more details,
		see the "proposed method" section of Liu, Bi, and Li (2025)
