		'RStudio' Addins for Show Outline of a R Markdown/'LaTeX' Project
		// 'RStudio' allows to show and navigate for the outline of a R
		Markdown file, but not for R Markdown projects with multiple
		files. For this reason, I have developed several 'RStudio'
		addins capable of show project outline. Each addin is
		specialized in showing projects of different types: R Markdown
		project, 'bookdown' package project and 'LaTeX' project. There
		is a configuration file that allows you to customize additional
		searches.
