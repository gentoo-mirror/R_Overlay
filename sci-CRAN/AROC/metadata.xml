		Covariate-Adjusted Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
		Inference // Estimates the covariate-adjusted Receiver
		Operating Characteristic (AROC) curve and pooled (unadjusted)
		ROC curve by different methods. Inacio de Carvalho, V., and
		Rodriguez-Alvarez, M. X. (2018) arXiv:1806.00473. NOTE: We have
		created a new package, 'ROCnReg', with more functionalities. It
		also implements all the methods included in 'AROC'. We,
		therefore, recommend using 'ROCnReg' ('AROC' will no longer be
		maintained).
