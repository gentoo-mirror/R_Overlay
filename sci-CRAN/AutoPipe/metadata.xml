		Automated Transcriptome Classifier Pipeline: Comprehensive
		Transcriptome Analysis // An unsupervised fully-automated
		pipeline for transcriptome analysis or a supervised option to
		identify characteristic genes from predefined subclasses. We
		rely on the 'pamr'
		http://www.bioconductor.org/packages//2.7/bioc/html/pamr.html
		clustering algorithm to cluster the Data and then draw a
		heatmap of the clusters with the most significant genes and the
		least significant genes according to the 'pamr' algorithm. This
		way we get easy to grasp heatmaps that show us for each cluster
		which are the clusters most defining genes.
