		Mapping Smoothed Effect Estimates from Individual-Level Data //
		Contains functions for mapping odds ratios, hazard ratios, or
		other effect estimates using individual-level data such as
		case-control study data, using generalized additive models
		(GAMs) or Cox models for smoothing with a two-dimensional
		predictor (e.g., geolocation or exposure to chemical mixtures)
		while adjusting linearly for confounding variables, using
		methods described by Kelsall and Diggle (1998), Webster at al.
		(2006), and Bai et al. (2020).  Includes convenient functions
		for mapping point estimates and confidence intervals, efficient
		control sampling, and permutation tests for the null hypothesis
		that the two-dimensional predictor is not associated with the
		outcome variable (adjusting for confounders).
