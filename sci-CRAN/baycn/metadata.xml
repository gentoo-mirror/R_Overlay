		Bayesian Inference for Causal Networks // A Bayesian hybrid
		approach for inferring Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for
		continuous, discrete, and mixed data. The algorithm can use the
		graph inferred by another more efficient graph inference method
		as input; the input graph may contain false edges or undirected
		edges but can help reduce the search space to a more manageable
		size. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is then
		used to infer the probability of direction and absence for the
		edges in the network. References: Martin and Fu (2019)
