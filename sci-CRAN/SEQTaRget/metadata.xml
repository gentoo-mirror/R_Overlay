		Sequential Trial Emulation // Implementation of sequential trial
		emulation for the analysis of observational databases. The
		'SEQTaRget' software accommodates time-varying treatments and
		confounders, as well as binary and failure time outcomes.
		'SEQTaRget' allows to compare both static and dynamic
		strategies, can be used to estimate observational analogs of
		intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects, and can adjust for
		potential selection bias induced by losses-to-follow-up. (Paper
		to come).
