		Tidy Tools for 'Raster' Data // Facilities to work with vector
		and raster data in efficient repeatable and systematic work
		flow. Missing functionality in existing packages is included
		here to allow extraction from raster data with 'simple
		features' and 'Spatial' types and to make extraction consistent
		and straightforward. Extract cell numbers from raster data and
		return the cells as a data frame rather than as lists of
		matrices or vectors. The functions here allow spatial data to
		be used without special handling for the format currently in
		use.
