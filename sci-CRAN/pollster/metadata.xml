		Calculate Crosstab and Topline Tables of Weighted Survey Data //
		Calculate common types of tables for weighted survey data.
		Options include topline and (2-way and 3-way) crosstab tables
		of categorical or ordinal data as well as summary tables of
		weighted numeric variables. Optionally, include the margin of
		error at selected confidence intervals including the design
		effect. The design effect is calculated as described by Kish
		(1965) doi:10.1002/bimj.19680100122 beginning on page 257.
		Output takes the form of tibbles (simple data frames). This
		package conveniently handles labelled data, such as that
		commonly used by 'Stata' and 'SPSS.' Complex survey design is
		not supported at this time.
