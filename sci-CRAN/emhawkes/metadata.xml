		Exponential Multivariate Hawkes Model // Simulate and fitting
		exponential multivariate Hawkes model. This package simulates a
		multivariate Hawkes model, introduced by Hawkes (1971)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/58.1.83, with an exponential kernel and fits
		the parameters from the data. Models with the constant
		parameters, as well as complex dependent structures, can also
		be simulated and estimated. The estimation is based on the
		maximum likelihood method, introduced by introduced by Ozaki
		(1979) doi:10.1007/BF02480272, with 'maxLik' package.
