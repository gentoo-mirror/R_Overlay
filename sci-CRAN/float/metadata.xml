		32-Bit Floats // R comes with a suite of utilities for linear
		algebra with "numeric" (double precision) vectors/matrices.
		However, sometimes single precision (or less!) is more than
		enough for a particular task.  This package extends R's linear
		algebra facilities to include 32-bit float (single precision)
		data. Float vectors/matrices have half the precision of their
		"numeric"-type counterparts but are generally faster to
		numerically operate on, for a performance vs accuracy trade-
		off.  The internal representation is an S4 class, which allows
		us to keep the syntax identical to that of base R's.
		Interaction between floats and base types for binary operators
		is generally possible; in these cases, type promotion always
		defaults to the higher precision.  The package ships with
		copies of the single precision 'BLAS' and 'LAPACK', which are
		automatically built in the event they are not available on the
		system.
