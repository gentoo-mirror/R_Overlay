		Individual-Based, Spatially-Explicit Simulation and Analysis of
		Multi-State Movements in River Networks and Heterogeneous
		Landscapes // Provides functions to generate and analyze
		individual-based spatially-explicit simulations of multi-state
		movements in heterogeneous landscapes, based on "resistance"
		rasters. Although originally conceived and designed to simulate
		spatially-explicit trajectories of species constrained to
		linear, dendritic habitats (e.g., river networks), the
		simulation algorithm is built to be highly flexible and can be
		applied to any (aquatic, semi-aquatic or terrestrial) organism.
		Thus, the user will be able to use the package to simulate
		movements either in homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous
		landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic animal moving mainly along rivers
		but also using the matrix), or even in highly contrasted
		landscapes (e.g. fish in a river network). The algorithm and
		its input parameters are the same for all cases, so that
		results are comparable. Simulated trajectories can then be used
		as mechanistic null models to test e.g. for species site
		fidelity and other 'Movement Ecology' hypotheses, or for other
		predictive purposes. The package should thus be relevant to
		explore a broad spectrum of ecological phenomena, such as those
		at the interface of animal behaviour, landscape, spatial and
		movement ecology, disease and invasive species spread, and
		population dynamics.
