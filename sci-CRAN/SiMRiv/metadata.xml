		Individual-Based, Spatially-Explicit Simulation and Analysis of
		Multi-State Movements in River Networks, Homogeneous, and
		Heterogeneous Landscapes // Provides functions to generate and
		analyze individual-based spatially-explicit simulations of
		multi-state movements in heterogeneous landscapes, based on
		"resistance" rasters. Although originally conceived and
		designed to simulate spatially-explicit trajectories of species
		constrained to linear habitats or dendritic ecological networks
		(e.g., river networks), the simulation algorithm is built to be
		highly flexible and can be applied to any (aquatic, semi-
		aquatic or terrestrial) organism, independently on the
		landscape in which it moves. Thus, the user will be able to use
		the package to simulate movements either in homogeneous
		landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic animal
		moving mainly along rivers but also using the matrix), or even
		in highly contrasted landscapes (e.g. fish in a river network).
		The algorithm and its input parameters are the same for all
		cases, so that results are comparable. Simulated trajectories
		can then be used as mechanistic null models to test e.g. for
		species site fidelity and other 'Movement Ecology' hypotheses
		(Nathan et al. 2008, DOI:10.1073/pnas.0800375105), or for other
		predictive purposes. The package should thus be relevant to
		explore a broad spectrum of ecological phenomena, such as those
		at the interface of animal behaviour, landscape, spatial and
		movement ecology, disease and invasive species spread, and
		population dynamics.
