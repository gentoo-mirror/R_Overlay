		Simulating Multistate Movements in River/Heterogeneous Landscapes
		// Provides functions to generate and analyze spatially-
		explicit individual-based multistate movements in rivers,
		heterogeneous and homogeneous spaces. This is done by
		incorporating landscape bias on local behaviour, based on
		resistance rasters. Although originally conceived and designed
		to simulate trajectories of species constrained to linear
		habitats/dendritic ecological networks (e.g. river networks),
		the simulation algorithm is built to be highly flexible and can
		be applied to any (aquatic, semi-aquatic or terrestrial)
		organism, independently on the landscape in which it moves.
		Thus, the user will be able to use the package to simulate
		movements either in homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous
		landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic animal moving mainly along rivers
		but also using the matrix), or even in highly contrasted
		landscapes (e.g. fish in a river network). The algorithm and
		its input parameters are the same for all cases, so that
		results are comparable. Simulated trajectories can then be used
		as mechanistic null models (Potts  Lewis 2014,
		DOI:10.1098/rspb.2014.0231) to test a variety of 'Movement
		Ecology' hypotheses (Nathan et al. 2008,
		DOI:10.1073/pnas.0800375105), including landscape effects (e.g.
		resources, infrastructures) on animal movement and species site
		fidelity, or for predictive purposes (e.g. road mortality risk,
		dispersal/connectivity). The package should be relevant to
		explore a broad spectrum of ecological phenomena, such as those
		at the interface of animal behaviour, management, landscape and
		movement ecology, disease and invasive species spread, and
		population dynamics.
