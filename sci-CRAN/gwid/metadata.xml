		Genome-Wide Identity-by-Descent // Methods and tools for the
		analysis of Genome Wide Identity-by-Descent ('gwid') mapping
		data, focusing on testing whether there is a higher occurrence
		of Identity-By-Descent (IBD) segments around potential causal
		variants in cases compared to controls, which is crucial for
		identifying rare variants. To enhance its analytical power,
		'gwid' incorporates a Sliding Window Approach, allowing for the
		detection and analysis of signals from multiple Single
		Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).
