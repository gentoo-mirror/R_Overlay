		Stratified Medicine // A toolkit for stratified medicine,
		subgroup identification, and precision medicine. Current tools
		include (1) filtering models (reduce covariate space), (2)
		patient-level estimate models (counterfactual patient-level
		quantities, for example the individual treatment effect), (3)
		subgroup identification models (find subsets of patients with
		similar treatment effects), and (4) parameter estimation and
		inference (for the overall population and discovered
		subgroups). These tools can directly feed into stratified
		medicine algorithms including PRISM (patient response
		identifiers for stratified medicine; Jemielita and Mehrotra
		(2019) arXiv:1912.03337. PRISM is a flexible and general
		framework which accepts user-created models/functions. This
		package is in beta and will be continually updated.
