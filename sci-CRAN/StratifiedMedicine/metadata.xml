		Stratified Medicine // A toolkit for stratified medicine,
		subgroup identification, and precision medicine. Current tools
		include (1) filtering models (reduce covariate space), (2)
		patient-level estimate models (counterfactual patient-level
		quantities, for example the individual treatment effect), (3)
		subgroup identification models (find subsets of patients with
		similar treatment effects), and (4) parameter estimation and
		inference (for the overall population and discovered
		subgroups). These tools can directly feed into stratified
		medicine algorithms including PRISM (patient identifiers for
		stratified medicine; Jemielita and Mehrotra 2019 (in
		progress)). PRISM is a flexible and general framework which
		accepts user-created models/functions. This package is in beta
		and will be continually updated.
