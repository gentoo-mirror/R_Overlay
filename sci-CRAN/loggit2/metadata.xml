		Easy-to-Use, Dependencyless Logger // An easy-to-use 'ndjson'
		(newline-delimited 'JSON') logger. It provides a set of
		wrappers for base R's message(), warning(), and stop()
		functions that maintain identical functionality, but also log
		the handler message to an 'ndjson' log file. No change in
		existing code is necessary to use this package, and only a few
		additional adjustments are needed to fully utilize its
		potential.
