		Interface for Multilevel Regression and Poststratification //
		Dual interfaces, graphical and programmatic, designed for

		Poststratification (MRP). Users can apply the method to a
		variety of datasets, from electronic health records to sample
		survey data, through an end-to-end Bayesian data analysis
		workflow. The package provides robust tools for data cleaning,
		exploratory analysis, flexible model building, and insightful
		result visualization. For more details, see Si et al. (2020) ht
