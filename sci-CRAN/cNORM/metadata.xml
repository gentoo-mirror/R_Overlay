		Continuous Norming // A comprehensive toolkit for generating
		continuous test norms in psychometrics and biometrics, and
		analyzing model fit. The package offers both distribution-free
		modeling using Taylor polynomials and parametric modeling using
		the beta-binomial distribution. Originally developed for
		achievement tests, it is applicable to a wide range of mental,
		physical, or other test scores dependent on continuous or
		discrete explanatory variables. The package provides several
		advantages: It minimizes deviations from representativeness in
		subsamples, interpolates between discrete levels of explanatory
		variables, and significantly reduces the required sample size
		compared to conventional norming per age group. cNORM enables
		graphical and analytical evaluation of model fit, accommodates
		a wide range of scales including those with negative and
		descending values, and even supports conventional norming. It
		generates norm tables including confidence intervals. It also
		includes methods for addressing representativeness issues
		through Iterative Proportional Fitting.
