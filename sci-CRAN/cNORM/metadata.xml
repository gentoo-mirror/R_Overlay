		Continuous Norming // Conventional methods for producing standard
		scores in psychometrics or biometrics are often plagued with
		"jumps" or "gaps" (i.e., discontinuities) in norm tables and
		low confidence for assessing extreme scores. The continuous
		norming method introduced by A. Lenhard et al. (2016,
		doi:10.1177/1073191116656437; 2019,
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0222279) and generates continuous test
		norm scores on the basis of the raw data from standardization
		samples, without requiring assumptions about the distribution
		of the raw data: Norm scores are directly established from raw
		data by modeling the latter ones as a function of both
		percentile scores and an explanatory variable (e.g., age). The
		method minimizes bias arising from sampling and measurement
		error, while handling marked deviations from normality,
		addressing bottom or ceiling effects and capturing almost all
		of the variance in the original norm data sample. An online
		demonstration is available via
		https://cnorm.shinyapps.io/cNORM/.
