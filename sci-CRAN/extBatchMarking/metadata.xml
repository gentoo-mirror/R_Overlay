		Extended Batch Marking Models // A system for batch-marking data
		analysis to estimate survival probabilities, capture
		probabilities, and enumerate the population abundance for both
		marked and unmarked individuals. The estimation of only marked
		individuals can be achieved through the batchMarkOptim()
		function. Similarly, the combined marked and unmarked can be
		achieved through the batchMarkUnmarkOptim() function. The
		algorithm was also implemented for the hidden Markov model
		encapsulated in batchMarkUnmarkOptim() to estimate the
		abundance of both marked and unmarked individuals in the
		population. The package is based on the paper: "Hidden Markov
		Models for Extended Batch Data" of Cowen et al. (2017)
