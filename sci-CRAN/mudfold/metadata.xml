		Multiple UniDimensional unFOLDing // Nonparametric unfolding item
		response theory (IRT) model for dichotomous data (see W.H. Van
		Schuur (1984). Structure in Political Beliefs: A New Model for
		Stochastic Unfolding with Application to European Party
		Activists, and W.J.Post (1992). Nonparametric Unfolding Models:
		A Latent Structure Approach). The package implements MUDFOLD
		(Multiple UniDimensional unFOLDing), an iterative item
		selection algorithm that constructs unfolding scales from
		dichotomous preferential-choice data without explicitly
		assuming a parametric form of the item response functions.
		Scale diagnostics from Post(1992) and estimates for the person
		locations proposed by Johnson(2006) and Van Schuur(1984) are
		also available. This model can be seen as the unfolding variant
		of Mokken(1971) scaling method.
