		Parallel Pseudo Random Number Generator (PPRNG) 'sitmo' Header
		Files // Provided within is a high quality and fast PPRNG that
		is able to be used in an 'OpenMP' parallel environment compiled
		under either C++98 or C++11. The objective of this package
		release is to consolidate the distribution of the 'sitmo'
		library on CRAN by enabling others to link to the 'sitmo'
		header file instead of including a copy of 'sitmo' within their
		individual package. Lastly, the package contains example
		implementations using 'sitmo' and three accompanying vignette
		that provide additional information.
