		Parallel Pseudo Random Number Generator (PPRNG) 'sitmo' Header
		Files // Provided within are two high quality and fast PPRNGs
		that may be used in an 'OpenMP' parallel environment. In
		addition, there is a generator for one dimensional low-
		discrepancy sequence. The objective of this library to
		consolidate the distribution of the 'sitmo' (C++98  C++11),
		'threefry' and 'vandercorput' (C++11-only) engines on CRAN by
		enabling others to link to the header files inside of 'sitmo'
		instead of including a copy of each engine within their
		individual package. Lastly, the package contains example
		implementations using the 'sitmo' package and three
		accompanying vignette that provide additional information.
