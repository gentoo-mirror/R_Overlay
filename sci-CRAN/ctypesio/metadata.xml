		Read and Write Standard 'C' Types from Files, Connections and Raw
		Vectors // Interacting with binary files can be difficult
		because R's types are a subset of what is generally supported
		by 'C'.  This package provides a suite of functions for reading
		and writing binary data (with files, connections, and raw
		vectors) using 'C' type descriptions.  These functions convert
		data between 'C' types and R types while checking for values
		outside the type limits, 'NA' values, etc.
