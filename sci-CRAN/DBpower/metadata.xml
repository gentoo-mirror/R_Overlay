		Finite Sample Power Calculations for Detection Boundary Tests //
		Calculates lower bound on power, upper bound on power, and
		exact power (small sets only) for detection boundary tests
		(e.g. Berk-Jones, Generalized Berk-Jones, innovated Berk-Jones)
		used in set-based inference studies. These detection boundary
		tests are described in Sun et al., (2019)
