		Compute the NPMLE of Distribution Function from Doubly Censored
		Data, Plus the Empirical Likelihood Ratio for F(T) // Doubly
		censored data, as described in Chang and Yang (1987) doi:
		10.1214/aos/1176350608), are commonly seen in many fields. We
		use EM algorithm to compute the non-parametric MLE (NPMLE) of
		the cummulative probability function/survival function and the
		two censoring distributions. One can also specify a constraint
		F(T)=C, it will return the constrained NPMLE and the -2 log
		empirical likelihood ratio for this constraint. This can be
		used to test the hypothesis about the constraint and, by
		inverting the test, find confidence intervals for probability
		or quantile via empirical likelihood ratio theorem. Influence
		functions of hat F may also be calculated, but currently, the
		it may be slow.
