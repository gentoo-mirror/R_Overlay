		The Generalized Hyperbolic Distribution // Functions for the
		hyperbolic and related distributions. Density, distribution and
		quantile functions and random number generation are provided
		for the hyperbolic distribution, the generalized hyperbolic
		distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and
		the skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality is
		provided for the hyperbolic distribution, normal inverse
		Gaussian distribution and generalized inverse Gaussian
		distribution, including fitting of these distributions to data.
		Linear models with hyperbolic errors may be fitted using
		hyperblmFit.
