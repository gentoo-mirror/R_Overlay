		Adjacency-Constrained Clustering of a Block-Diagonal Similarity
		Matrix // Implements a constrained version of hierarchical
		agglomerative clustering, in which each observation is
		associated to a position, and only adjacent clusters can be
		merged. Typical application fields in bioinformatics include
		Genome-Wide Association Studies or Hi-C data analysis, where
		the similarity between items is a decreasing function of their
		genomic distance. Taking advantage of this feature, the
		implemented algorithm is time and memory efficient. This
		algorithm is described in Chapter 4 of Alia Dehman (2015)
