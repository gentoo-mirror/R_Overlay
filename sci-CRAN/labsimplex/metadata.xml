		Simplex Optimization Algorithms for Laboratory and Manufacturing
		Processes // Simplex optimization algorithms as firstly
		proposed by Spendley et al. (1962)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.1962.10490033 and later modified by Nelder
		and Mead (1965) doi:10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308 for laboratory and
		manufacturing processes. The package also provides tools for
		graphical representation of the simplexes and some example
		response surfaces that are useful in illustrating the
		optimization process.
