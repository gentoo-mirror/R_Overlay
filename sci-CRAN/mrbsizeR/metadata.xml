		Scale Space Multiresolution Analysis of Random Signals // A
		method for the multiresolution analysis of spatial fields and
		images to capture scale-dependent features. mrbsizeR is based
		on scale space smoothing and uses differences of smooths at
		neighbouring scales for finding features on different scales.
		To infer which of the captured features are credible, Bayesian
		analysis is used. The scale space multiresolution analysis has
		three steps: (1) Bayesian signal reconstruction. (2) Using
		differences of smooths, scale-dependent features of the
		reconstructed signal can be found. (3) Posterior credibility
		analysis of the differences of smooths created. The method has
		first been proposed by Holmstrom, Pasanen, Furrer, Sain (2011)
		DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2011.04.011. Matlab code is available under
		http://cc.oulu.fi/~lpasanen/MRBSiZer/.
