		Color Calculations with Emphasis on Spectral Data // Calculate
		with spectral properties of light sources, materials, cameras,
		eyes, and scanners. Build complex systems from simpler parts
		using a spectral product algebra. For light sources, compute
		CCT and CRI.  For object colors, compute optimal colors and
		Logvinenko coordinates. Work with the standard CIE illuminants
		and color matching functions, and read spectra from text files,
		including CGATS files.  A user guide and 7 vignettes are
		included.
