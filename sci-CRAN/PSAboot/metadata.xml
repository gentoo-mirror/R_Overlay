		Bootstrapping for Propensity Score Analysis // It is often
		advantageous to test a hypothesis more than once in the context
		of propensity score analysis (Rosenbaum, 2012)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/ass032. The functions in this package
		facilitate bootstrapping for propensity score analysis (PSA).
		By default, bootstrapping using two classification tree methods
		(using 'rpart' and 'ctree' functions), two matching methods
		(using 'Matching' and 'MatchIt' packages), and stratification
		with logistic regression.  A framework is described for users
		to implement additional propensity score methods.
		Visualizations are emphasized for diagnosing balance; exploring
		the correlation relationships between bootstrap samples and
		methods; and to summarize results.
