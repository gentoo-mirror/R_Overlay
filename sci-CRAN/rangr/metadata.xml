		Mechanistic Simulation of Species Range Dynamics // Integrates
		population dynamics and dispersal into a mechanistic virtual
		species simulator. The package can be used to study the effects
		of environmental change on population growth and range shifts.
		It allows for simple and straightforward definition of
		population dynamics (including positive density dependence),
		extensive possibilities for defining dispersal kernels, and the
		ability to generate virtual ecologist data. Learn more about
		the 'rangr' at https://docs.ropensci.org/rangr/.
