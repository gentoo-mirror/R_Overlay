		Tools for Choice Model Estimation and Application // The Choice
		Modelling Centre at the University of Leeds has developed
		flexible estimation code for choice models in R. Users are able
		to write their own likelihood functions or use a mix of already
		available ones. Mixing, in the form of random coefficients and
		components is allowed for all models. Both classical and
		Bayesian estimation are available. Multi-threading processing
		is supported. For more information on discrete choice models
		see Train, K. (2009) isbn:978-0-521-74738-7.
