		Tools for Choice Model Estimation and Application // Choice
		models are a widely used technique across numerous scientific
		disciplines. The Apollo package is a very flexible tool for the
		estimation and application of choice models in R. Users are
		able to write their own model functions or use a mix of already
		available ones. Random heterogeneity, both continuous and
		discrete and at the level of individuals and choices, can be
		incorporated for all models. There is support for both
		standalone models and hybrid model structures.  Both classical
		and Bayesian estimation is available, and multiple discrete
		continuous models are covered in addition to discrete choice.
		Multi-threading processing is supported for estimation and a
		large number of pre and post-estimation routines, including for
		computing posterior (individual-level) distributions are
		available. For examples, a manual, and a support forum, visit
		http://www.ApolloChoiceModelling.com. For more information on
		choice models see Train, K. (2009) isbn:978-0-521-74738-7 and
		Hess, S.  Daly, A.J. (2014) isbn:978-1-781-00314-5 for an
		overview of the field.
