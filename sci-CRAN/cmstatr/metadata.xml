		Statistical Methods for Composite Material Data // An
		implementation of the statistical methods commonly used for
		advanced composite materials in aerospace applications. This
		package focuses on calculating basis values (lower tolerance
		bounds) for material strength properties, as well as performing
		the associated diagnostic tests. This package provides
		functions for calculating basis values assuming several
		different distributions, as well as providing functions for
		non-parametric methods of computing basis values. Functions are
		also provided for testing the hypothesis that there is no
		difference between strength and modulus data from an alternate
		sample and that from a "qualification" or "baseline" sample.
		For a discussion of these statistical methods and their use,
		see the Composite Materials Handbook, Volume 1 (2012, ISBN:
		978-0-7680-7811-4). Additional details about this package are
		available in the paper by Kloppenborg (2020,
		doi:10.21105/joss.02265).
