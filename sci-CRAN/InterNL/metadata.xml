		Time Series Intervention Model Using Non-Linear Function //
		Intervention analysis is used to investigate structural changes
		in data resulting from external events. Traditional time series
		intervention models, viz. Autoregressive Integrated Moving
		Average model with exogeneous variables (ARIMA-X) and
		Artificial Neural Networks with exogeneous variables (ANN-X),
		rely on linear intervention functions such as step or ramp
		functions, or their combinations. In this package, the
		Gompertz, Logistic, Monomolecular, Richard and Hoerl function
		have been used as non-linear intervention function. The
		equation of the above models are represented as: Gompertz: A *
		exp(-B * exp(-k * t)); Logistic: K / (1 + ((K - N0) / N0) *
		exp(-r * t)); Monomolecular: A * exp(-k * t); Richard: A + (K -
		A) / (1 + exp(-B * (C - t)))^(1/beta) and Hoerl:
		a*(b^t)*(t^c).This package introduced algorithm for time series
		intervention analysis employing ARIMA and ANN models with a
		non-linear intervention function. This package has been
		developed using algorithm of Yeasin et al.
