		Bayesian Decreasingly Informative Priors for Early Termination
		Phase II Trials // Provide early termination phase II trial
		designs with a decreasingly informative prior (DIP) or a
		regular Bayesian prior chosen by the user. The program can
		determine the minimum planned sample size necessary to achieve
		the user-specified admissible designs. The program can also
		perform power and expected sample size calculations for the
		tests in early termination Phase II trials. See Wang C and Sabo
