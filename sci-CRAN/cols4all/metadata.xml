		Colors for all // Color palettes for all people, including those
		with color vision deficiency. Popular color palette series have
		been organized by type and have been scored on several
		properties such as color-blind-friendliness and fairness (i.e.
		do colors stand out equally?). Own palettes can also be loaded
		and analysed. Besides the common palette types (categorical,
		sequential, and diverging) it also includes bivariate color
		palettes. Furthermore, a color for missing values is assigned
		to each palette.
