		Bootstrapping the Autoregressive Distributed Lags Tests for
		Cointegration // The bootstrap Autoregressive Distributed Lags
		(ARDL) tests for cointegration is the main functionality of
		this package. It also acts as a wrapper of the most commond
		ARDL testing procedures for cointegration: the bound tests of
		Pesaran, Shin and Smith (commonly PSS; 2001 -
		doi:10.1002/jae.616) and the asymptotic test on the independent
		variables of Sam, McNown and Goh (hence SMG: 2019 -
		doi:10.1016/j.econmod.2018.11.001). Bootstrap and bound tests
		are performed under both the conditional and unconditional ARDL
		models.
