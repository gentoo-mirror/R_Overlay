		Bootstrapping the ARDL Tests for Cointegration // The bootstrap
		ARDL tests for cointegration is the main functionality of this
		package. It also acts as a wrapper of the most commond ARDL
		testing procedures for cointegration: the bound tests of
		Pesaran, Shin and Smith (PSS; 2001 - doi:10.1002/jae.616) and
		the asymptotic test on the independent variables of Sam, McNown
		and Goh (SMG: 2019 - doi:10.1016/j.econmod.2018.11.001).
		Bootstrap and bound tests are performed under both the
		conditional and unconditional ARDL models.
