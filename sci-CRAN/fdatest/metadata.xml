		Interval Testing Procedure for Functional Data // Implementation
		of the Interval Testing Procedure for functional data in
		different frameworks (i.e., one or two-population frameworks,
		functional linear models) by means of different basis
		expansions (i.e., B-spline, Fourier, and phase-amplitude
		Fourier). The current version of the package requires
		functional data evaluated on a uniform grid; it automatically
		projects each function on a chosen functional basis; it
		performs the entire family of multivariate tests; and, finally,
		it provides the matrix of the p-values of the previous tests
		and the vector of the corrected p-values. The functional basis,
		the coupled or uncoupled scenario, and the kind of test can be
		chosen by the user. The package provides also a plotting
		function creating a graphical output of the procedure: the
		p-value heat-map, the plot of the corrected p-values, and the
		plot of the functional data.
