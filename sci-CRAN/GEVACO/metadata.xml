		Joint Test of Gene and GxE Interactions via Varying Coefficients
		// A novel statistical model to detect the joint genetic and
		dynamic gene-environment (GxE) interaction with continuous
		traits in genetic association studies. It uses varying-
		coefficient models to account for different GxE trajectories,
		regardless whether the relationship is linear or not. The
		package includes one function, GxEtest(), to test a single
		genetic variant (e.g., a single nucleotide polymorphism or
		SNP), and another function, GxEscreen(), to test for a set of
		genetic variants. The method involves a likelihood ratio test
		described in Crainiceanu, C. M., and Ruppert, D. (2004)
