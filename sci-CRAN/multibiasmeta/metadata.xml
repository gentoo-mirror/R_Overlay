		Sensitivity Analysis for Multiple Biases in Meta-Analyses //
		Meta-analyses can be compromised by studies' internal biases
		(e.g., confounding in nonrandomized studies) as well as by
		publication bias. This package conducts sensitivity analyses
		for the joint effects of these biases (per Mathur (2022)
		doi:10.31219/osf.io/u7vcb). These sensitivity analyses address
		two questions: (1) For a given severity of internal bias across
		studies and of publication bias, how much could the results
		change?; and (2) For a given severity of publication bias, how
		severe would internal bias have to be, hypothetically, to
		attenuate the results to the null or by a given amount?
