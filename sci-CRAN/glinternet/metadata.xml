		Learning Interactions via Hierarchical Group-Lasso Regularization
		// Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET. Fits linear pairwise-
		interaction models that satisfy strong hierarchy: if an
		interaction coefficient is estimated to be nonzero, then its
		two associated main effects also have nonzero estimated
		coefficients. Accommodates categorical variables (factors) with
		arbitrary numbers of levels, continuous variables, and
		combinations thereof. Implements the machinery described in the
		paper "Learning interactions via hierarchical group-lasso
		regularization" (JCGS 2015, Volume 24, Issue 3). Michael Lim
		Trevor Hastie (2015) DOI:10.1080/10618600.2014.938812.
