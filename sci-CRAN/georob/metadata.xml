		Robust Geostatistical Analysis of Spatial Data // The georob
		package provides functions for efficiently fitting linear
		models with spatially correlated errors by robust and Gaussian
		(Restricted) Maximum Likelihood and for computing robust and
		customary point and block external-drift kriging predictions,
		along with utility functions for variogram modelling in ad-hoc
		geostatistical analyses, model building, model evaluation by
		cross-validation and for unbiased back-transformation of
		kriging predictions of log-transformed data.
