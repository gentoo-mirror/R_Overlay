		Robust Geostatistical Analysis of Spatial Data // Provides
		functions for efficiently fitting linear models with spatially
		correlated errors by robust and Gaussian (Restricted) Maximum
		Likelihood and for computing robust and customary point and
		block external-drift Kriging predictions, along with utility
		functions for variogram modelling in ad hoc geostatistical
		analyses, model building, model evaluation by cross-validation,
		(conditional) simulation of Gaussian processes, unbiased back-
		transformation of Kriging predictions of log-transformed data.
