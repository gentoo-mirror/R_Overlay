		Machine Learning and Inference for Topological Data Analysis //
		Topological data analysis is a powerful tool for finding non-
		linear global structure in whole datasets. 'TDApplied' aims to
		bridge topological data analysis with data, statistical and
		machine learning practitioners so that more analyses may
		benefit from the power of topological data analysis. The main
		tool of topological data analysis is persistent homology, which
		computes a shape descriptor of a dataset, called a persistence
		diagram. There are five goals of this package: (1) convert
		persistence diagrams computed using the two main R packages for
		topological data analysis into a data frame, (2) implement fast
		versions of both distance and kernel calculations for pairs of
		persistence diagrams, (3) provide methods for machine learning
		and inference for persistence diagrams which scale well, (4)
		deliver a fast implementation of persistent homology via a
		python interface, and (5) contribute tools for the
		interpretation of persistence diagrams.
