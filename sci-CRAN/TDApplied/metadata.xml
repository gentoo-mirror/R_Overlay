		Machine Learning and Inference for Topological Data Analysis //
		Topological data analysis is a powerful tool for finding non-
		linear global structure in whole datasets. The main tool of
		topological data analysis is persistent homology, which
		computes a topological shape descriptor of a dataset called a
		persistence diagram. 'TDApplied' provides useful and efficient
		methods for analyzing groups of persistence diagrams with
		machine learning and statistical inference, and these functions
		can also interface with other data science packages to form
		flexible and integrated topological data analysis pipelines.
