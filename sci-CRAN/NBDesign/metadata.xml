		Design and Monitoring of Clinical Trials with Negative Binomial
		Endpoint // Calculate various functions needed for design and
		monitoring clinical trials with negative binomial endpoint with
		variable follow-up. This version has a few changes compared to
		the previous version 1.0.0, including (1) correct a typo in
		Type 1 censoring, mtbnull=bnull and (2) restructure the code to
		account for shape parameter equal to zero, i.e. Poisson
		scenario.
