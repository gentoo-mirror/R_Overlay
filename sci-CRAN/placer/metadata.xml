		PLastic ACcumulation Estimate using R (PLACER) // Assessment of
		the prevalence of plastic debris in bird nests based on
		bootstrap replicates. The package allows for calculating
		bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the estimated
		prevalence of debris. Combined with a Bayesian approach, the
		resampling simulations can be also used to define appropriate
		sample sizes to detect prevalence of plastics. The method has
		wide application, and can also be applied to estimate
		confidence intervals and define sample sizes for the prevalence
		of plastics ingested by any other organisms. The method is
		described in Tavares et al. (Submitted).
