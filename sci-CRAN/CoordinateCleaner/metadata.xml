		Automated Cleaning of Occurrence Records from Biological
		Collections // Automated cleaning of geographic species
		occurrence records by automated flagging of problems common to
		biodiversity data from biological collections. Includes
		automated tests to easily flag (and exclude) records assigned
		to country or province centroid, the open ocean, the
		headquarters of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility,
		urban areas or the location of biodiversity institutions
		(museums, zoos, botanical gardens, universities). Furthermore
		identifies per species outlier coordinates, zero coordinates,
		identical latitude/longitude and invalid coordinates. Also
		implements an algorithm to identify data sets with a
		significant proportion of rounded coordinates. Especially
		suited for large data sets. See
		https://github.com/azizka/CoordinateCleaner/wiki for more
		details and tutorials.
