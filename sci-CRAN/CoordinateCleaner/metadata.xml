		Automated Cleaning of Occurrence Records from Biological
		Collections // Automated flagging of common spatial and
		temporal errors in biological and paleontological collection
		data, for the use in conservation, ecology and paleontology.
		Includes automated tests to easily flag (and exclude) records
		assigned to country or province centroid, the open ocean, the
		headquarters of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility,
		urban areas or the location of biodiversity institutions
		(museums, zoos, botanical gardens, universities). Furthermore
		identifies per species outlier coordinates, zero coordinates,
		identical latitude/longitude and invalid coordinates. Also
		implements an algorithm to identify data sets with a
		significant proportion of rounded coordinates. Especially
		suited for large data sets. The reference for the methodology
		is: Zizka et al. (2019) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13152.
