		Machine Learning Immunogenicity and Vaccine Response Analysis //
		Used for analyzing immune responses and predicting vaccine
		efficacy using machine learning and advanced data processing
		techniques. 'Immunaut' integrates both unsupervised and
		supervised learning methods, managing outliers and capturing
		immune response variability. It performs multiple rounds of
		predictive model testing to identify robust immunogenicity
		signatures that can predict vaccine responsiveness. The
		platform is designed to handle high-dimensional immune data,
		enabling researchers to uncover immune predictors and refine
		personalized vaccination strategies across diverse populations.
