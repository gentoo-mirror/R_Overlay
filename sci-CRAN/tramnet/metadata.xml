		Penalized Transformation Models // Partially penalized versions
		of specific transformation models implemented in package 'mlt'.
		Available models include a fully parametric version of the Cox
		model, other parametric survival models (Weibull, etc.), models
		for binary and ordered categorical variables, normal and
		transformed-normal (Box-Cox type) linear models, and continuous
		outcome logistic regression. Hyperparameter tuning is
		facilitated through model-based optimization functionalities
		from package 'mlrMBO'. The accompanying vignette describes the
		methodology used in 'tramnet' in detail. Transformation models
		and model-based optimization are described in Hothorn et al.

		arxiv:1703.03373, respectively.
