		Cluster Adjusted t Statistic Applications // Simulation results
		detailed in Esarey and Menger (2019) doi:10.1017/psrm.2017.42
		demonstrate that cluster adjusted t statistics (CATs) are an
		effective method for correcting standard errors in scenarios
		with a small number of clusters. The 'mmiCATs' package offers a
		suite of tools for working with CATs. The mmiCATs() function
		initiates a 'shiny' web application, facilitating the analysis
		of data utilizing CATs, as implemented in the cluster.im.glm()
		function from the 'clusterSEs' package. Additionally, the
		pwr_func_lmer() function is designed to simplify the process of
		conducting simulations to compare mixed effects models with
		CATs models. For educational purposes, the CloseCATs() function
		launches a 'shiny' application card game, aimed at enhancing
		users' understanding of the conditions under which CATs should
		be preferred over random intercept models.
