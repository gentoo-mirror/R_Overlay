		Assessing Dissimilarity Between Multivariate Time Series //
		Provides tools to assess the dissimilarity between multivariate
		time-series. It is based on the psi measure described in
		"Numerical methods in Quaternary pollen analysis" (Birks and
		Gordon, 1985 doi:10.1002/jqs.3390020110), which computes
		dissimilarity constrained by sample order, but the original
		idea has been extended to work with any kind of multivariate
		time-series, no matter whether they are regular, irregular,
		aligned or unaligned. Furthermore, the package allows to assess
		the significance of dissimilarity values by applying a
		restricted permutation test, allows to measure the contribution
		of individual variables to dissimilarity, and offers tools to
		transfer attributes (generally time or age, but other are
		possible) between sequences based on the similarity of their
		samples.
