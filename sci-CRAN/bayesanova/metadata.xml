		Bayesian Inference in the Analysis of Variance via Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo in Gaussian Mixture Models // Provides a Bayesian
		version of the analysis of variance based on a three-component
		Gaussian mixture for which a Gibbs sampler produces posterior
		draws. For details about the Bayesian ANOVA based on Gaussian
		mixtures, see Kelter (2019) arXiv:1906.07524.
