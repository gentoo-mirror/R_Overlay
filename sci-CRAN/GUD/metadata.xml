		Bayesian Modal Regression Based on the GUD Family // Provides
		probability density functions and sampling algorithms for three
		key distributions from the General Unimodal Distribution (GUD)
		family: the Flexible Gumbel (FG) distribution, the Double Two-
		Piece (DTP) Student-t distribution, and the Two-Piece Scale
		(TPSC) Student-t distribution. Additionally, this package
		includes a function for Bayesian linear modal regression,
		leveraging these three distributions for model fitting. The
		details of the Bayesian modal regression model based on the GUD
		family can be found at Liu, Huang, and Bai (2024)
