		Fast Structural Filtering // An implementation of the fast
		structural filtering with L0 penalty. It includes an adaptive
		polynomial estimator by minimizing the least squares error with
		constraints on the number of breaks in their (k + 1)-st
		discrete derivative, for a chosen integer k = 0. It also
		includes generalized structure sparsity constraint, i.e., graph
		trend filtering. This package is implemented via the primal
		dual active set algorithm, which formulates estimates and
		residuals as primal and dual variables, and utilizes efficient
		active set selection strategies based on the properties of the
		primal and dual variables.
