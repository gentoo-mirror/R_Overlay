		'Rcpp' Implementation of 'FSelector' Entropy-Based Feature
		Selection Algorithms with a Sparse Matrix Support // 'Rcpp'
		(free of 'Java'/'Weka') implementation of 'FSelector' entropy-
		based feature selection algorithms based on an MDL
		discretization (Fayyad U. M., Irani K. B.: Multi-Interval
		Discretization of Continuous-Valued Attributes for
		Classification Learning. In 13'th International Joint
		Conference on Uncertainly in Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI93),
		pages 1022-1029, Chambery, France, 1993.)
