		'MassSpectrometry' Interaction Prediction // The 'MSiP' is a
		computational approach to predict protein-protein interactions
		from large-scale affinity purification mass 'spectrometry' (AP-
		MS) data. This approach includes both spoke and matrix models
		for interpreting AP-MS data in a network context. The "spoke"
		model considers only bait-prey interactions, whereas the
		"matrix" model assumes that each of the identified proteins
		(baits and prey) in a given AP-MS experiment interacts with
		each of the others. The spoke model has a high false-negative
		rate, whereas the matrix model has a high false-positive rate.
		Although, both statistical models have merits, a combination of
		both models has shown to increase the performance of machine
		learning classifiers in terms of their capabilities in
		discrimination between true and false positive interactions.
