		Document-Level Matching Between Bibliographic Datasets //
		Identifies and visualizes document overlap in any number of
		bibliographic datasets. This package implements the
		identification of overlapping documents through the exact match
		of a unique identifier (e.g. Digital Object Identifier - DOI)
		and, for records where the identifier is absent, through a
		score calculated from a set of fields commonly found in
		bibliographic datasets (Title, Source, Authors and Publication
		Year). Additionally, it provides functions to visualize the
		results of the document matching through a Venn diagram and/or
		UpSet plot, as well as a summary of the matching procedure.
