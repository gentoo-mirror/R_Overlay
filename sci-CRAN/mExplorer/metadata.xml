		Identifying Master Gene Regulators from Gene Expression and DNA-
		Binding Data // The method 'm:Explorer' associates a given list
		of target genes (e.g. those involved in a biological process)
		to gene regulators such as transcription factors. Transcription
		factors that bind DNA near significantly many target genes or
		correlate with target genes in transcriptional (microarray or
		RNAseq data) are selected. Selection of candidate master
		regulators is carried out using multinomial regression models,
		likelihood ratio tests and multiple testing correction.

		positive and negative regulators of longevity in yeast
