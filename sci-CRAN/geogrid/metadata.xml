		Turn Geospatial Polygons into Regular or Hexagonal Grids // Turn
		irregular polygons (such as geographical regions) into regular
		or hexagonal grids. This package enables the generation of
		regular (square) and hexagonal grids through the package 'sp'
		and then assigns the content of the existing polygons to the
		new grid using the Hungarian algorithm, Kuhn (1955)
		(doi:10.1007/978-3-540-68279-0_2). This prevents the need for
		manual generation of hexagonal grids or regular grids that are
		supposed to reflect existing geography.
