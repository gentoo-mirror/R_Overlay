		Connect and Work with Clinical Trials Data Sources // Are you
		spending too much time fetching and managing clinical trial
		data? Struggling with complex queries and bulk data extraction?
		What if you could simplify this process with just a few lines
		of code? Introducing 'clintrialx' - Fetch clinical trial data
		from sources like 'ClinicalTrials.gov'
		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ and the 'Clinical Trials
		Transformation Initiative - Access to Aggregate Content of
		ClinicalTrials.gov' database https://aact.ctti-
		clinicaltrials.org/, supporting pagination and bulk downloads.
		Also, you can generate HTML reports based on the data obtained
		from the sources!
