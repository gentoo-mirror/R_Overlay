		Langevin Tour // An HTML widget that tours 2D projections of
		numerical data. A random walk through projections of the data
		is shown. The user can manipulate the plot to use specified
		axes, or turn on projection pursuit to find an informative
		projection of the data. Groups within the data can be turned
		off or on, as can particular axes. Extra axes, for example
		principal component axes, can be specified. The underlying
		method to produce the random walk and projection pursuit uses
		Langevin dynamics. The widget can be used from within R, or
		included for example in a self-contained Rmarkdown document.
