		Langevin Tour // An HTML widget that randomly tours 2D
		projections of numerical data. A random walk through
		projections of the data is shown. The user can manipulate the
		plot to use specified axes, or turn on Guided Tour mode to find
		an informative projection of the data. Groups within the data
		can be hidden or shown, as can particular axes. Points can be
		brushed, and the selection can be linked to other widgets using
		crosstalk. The underlying method to produce the random walk and
		projection pursuit uses Langevin dynamics. The widget can be
		used from within R, or included in a self-contained R Markdown
		or Quarto document or presentation, or used in a Shiny app.
