		Mixed-Effect Models, with or without Spatial Random Effects //
		Inference based on models with or without spatially-correlated
		random effects, multivariate responses, or non-Gaussian random
		effects (e.g., Beta). Variation in residual variance
		(heteroscedasticity) can itself be represented by a mixed-
		effect model. Both classical geostatistical models (Rousset and
		Ferdy 2014 doi:10.1111/ecog.00566), and Markov random field
		models on irregular grids (as considered in the 'INLA' package,
		https://www.r-inla.org), can be fitted, with distinct
		computational procedures exploiting the sparse matrix
		representations for the latter case and other autoregressive
		models. Laplace approximations are used for likelihood or
		restricted  likelihood. Penalized quasi-likelihood and other
		variants discussed in the h-likelihood literature (Lee and
		Nelder 2001 doi:10.1093/biomet/88.4.987) are also implemented.
