		Mixed-Effect Models, Particularly Spatial Models // Inference in
		mixed-effect models, including generalized linear mixed models
		with spatial correlations and models with non-Gaussian random
		effects (e.g., Beta Binomial, or negative-binomial mixed
		models). Variation in residual variance is handled and can be
		modelled as a linear model. Various approximations of
		likelihood or restricted likelihood are implement, in
		particular h-likelihood and Laplace approximation.
