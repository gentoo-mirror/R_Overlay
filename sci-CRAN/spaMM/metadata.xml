		Mixed-Effect Models, Particularly Spatial Models // Inference in
		mixed-effect models, including generalized linear mixed models
		with spatial correlations and models with non-Gaussian random
		effects (e.g., Beta). Variation in residual variance
		(heteroscedasticity) can itself be represented by a generalized
		linear mixed model. Various approximations of likelihood or
		restricted likelihood are implemented, in particular
		h-likelihood (Lee and Nelder 2001 doi:10.1093/biomet/88.4.987)
		and Laplace approximation.
