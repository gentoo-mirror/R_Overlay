		Mixed-Effect Models, Particularly Spatial Models // Inference
		based on mixed-effect models, including generalized linear
		mixed models with spatial correlations and models with non-
		Gaussian random effects (e.g., Beta). Various approximations of
		likelihood or restricted likelihood are implemented, in
		particular Laplace approximation and h-likelihood (Lee and
		Nelder 2001 doi:10.1093/biomet/88.4.987). Both classical
		geostatistical models, and Markov random field models on
		irregular grids (as considered in the 'INLA' package,
		https://www.r-inla.org), can be fitted. Variation in residual
		variance (heteroscedasticity) can itself be represented by a
		mixed-effect model.
