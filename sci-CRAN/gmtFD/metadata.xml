		General Multiple Tests for Univariate and Multivariate Functional
		Data // The multiple contrast tests for univariate were
		proposed by Munko, Ditzhaus, Pauly, Smaga, and Zhang (2023)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2306.15259. Recently, they were extended to
		the multivariate functional data in Munko, Ditzhaus, Pauly, and
		Smaga (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.01242. These procedures
		enable us to evaluate the overall hypothesis regarding
		equality, as well as specific hypotheses defined by contrasts.
		In particular, we can perform post hoc tests to examine
		particular comparisons of interest. Different experimental
		designs are supported, e.g., one-way and multi-way analysis of
		variance for functional data.
