		Recursive Partitioning for Structural Equation Models // SEM
		Trees and SEM Forests -- an extension of model-based decision
		trees and forests to Structural Equation Models (SEM). SEM
		trees hierarchically split empirical data into homogeneous
		groups each sharing similar data patterns with respect to a SEM
		by recursively selecting optimal predictors of these
		differences. SEM forests are an extension of SEM trees. They
		are ensembles of SEM trees each built on a random sample of the
		original data. By aggregating over a forest, we obtain measures
		of variable importance that are more robust than measures from
		single trees. A description of the method was published by
		Brandmaier, von Oertzen, McArdle,  Lindenberger (2013;
		doi:10.1037/a0030001) and Arnold, Voelkle,  Brandmaier (2020;
		doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2020.564403).
