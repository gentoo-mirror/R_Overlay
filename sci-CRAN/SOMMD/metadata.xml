		Self Organising Maps for the Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Data
		// Processes data from Molecular Dynamics simulations using
		Self Organising Maps. Features include the ability to read
		different input formats. Trajectories can be analysed to
		identify groups of important frames. Output visualisation can
		be generated for maps and pathways. Methodological details can
		be found in Motta S et al (2022) doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.1c01163.
		I/O functions for xtc format files were implemented using the
		'xdrfile' library available under open source license. The
		relevant information can be found in inst/COPYRIGHT.
