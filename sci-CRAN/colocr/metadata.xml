		Conduct Co-Localization Analysis of Fluorescence Microscopy
		Images // Automate the co-localization analysis of fluorescence
		microscopy images. Selecting regions of interest, extract pixel
		intensities from the image channels and calculate different co-
		localization statistics. The methods implemented in this
		package are based on Dunn et al. (2011)
