		Error Handling Made Easy // Set of tools to facilitate package
		development and make R a more user-friendly place. Mostly for
		developers (or anyone who writes/shares functions). Provides a
		simple, powerful and flexible way to check the arguments passed
		to functions. The developer can easily describe the type of
		argument needed. If the user provides a wrong argument, then an
		informative error message is prompted with the requested type
		and the problem clearly stated--saving the user a lot of time
		in debugging.
