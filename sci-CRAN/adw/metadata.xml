		Angular Distance Weighting Interpolation // The irregularly-
		spaced data are interpolated onto regular latitude-longitude
		grids by weighting each station according to its distance and
		angle from the center of a search radius. In addition to this,
		we also provide a simple way (Jones and Hulme, 1996) to grid
		the irregularly-spaced data points onto regular latitude-
		longitude grids by averaging all stations in grid-boxes.
