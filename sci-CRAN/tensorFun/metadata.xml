		Basic Functions to Handle Tensor Data in Array Class // Basic
		functions to handle higher-order tensor data. See Kolda and
		Bader (2009) doi:10.1137/07070111X for details on tensor. While
		existing packages on tensor data extend the base 'array' class
		to some S4 classes, this package serves as an alternative
		resort to handle tensor only as 'array' class. Some
		functionalities related to missingness and rearrangement,
		discussed in Bai and Ng (2021) arXiv:1910.06677, are also
		supported.
