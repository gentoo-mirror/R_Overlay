		Frequency Matrix Approach for Assessing Very Low Frequency
		Variants in Sequence Records // Using frequency matrices, very
		low frequency variants (VLFs) are assessed for amino acid and
		nucleotide sequences.  The VLFs are then compared to see if
		they occur in only one member of a species, singleton VLFs, or
		if they occur in multiple members of a species, shared VLFs.
		The amino acid and nucleotide VLFs are then compared to see if
		they are concordant with one another.  Amino acid VLFs are also
		assessed to determine if they lead to a change in amino acid
		residue type, and potential changes to protein structures.
		Based on Stoeckle and Kerr (2012)
