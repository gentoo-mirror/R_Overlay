		Methods of Moments // Several classes for moment-based models are
		defined. The classes are defined for moment conditions derived
		from a single equation or a system of equations. The conditions
		can also be expressed as functions or formulas. Several methods
		are also offered to facilitate the development of different
		estimation techniques. The methods that are currently provided
		are the Generalized method of moments (Hansen 1982;
		doi:10.2307/1912775), for single equations and systems of
		equation, and  the Generalized Empirical Likelihood (Smith
		1997; doi:10.1111/j.0013-0133.1997.174.x, Kitamura 1997;
		doi:10.1214/aos/1069362388, Newey and Smith 2004;
		doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00482.x, and Anatolyev 2005
		doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2005.00601.x). Some work is being done
		to add tools to deal with weak and/or many instruments. This
		includes K-Class estimators (Limited Information Maximum
		Likelihood and Fuller), Anderson and Rubin statistic test, etc.
