		Fast Cross-Validation for Multi-Penalty Ridge Regression //
		Multi-penalty linear, logistic and cox ridge regression,
		including estimation of the penalty parameters by efficient
		(repeated) cross-validation and marginal likelihood
		maximization. Multiple high-dimensional data types that require
		penalization are allowed, as well as unpenalized variables.
		Paired and preferential data types can be specified. See Van de
		Wiel et al. (2021), arXiv:2005.09301.
