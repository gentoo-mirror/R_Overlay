		Change-Point Estimation for Expensive and High-Dimensional Models
		// This implements the methods developed in, L. Bybee and Y.
		Atchade. (2017) arXiv:1707.04306.  Contains a series of methods
		for estimating change-points given user specified black-box
		models.  The methods include binary segmentation for multiple
		change-point estimation. For estimating each individual change-
		point the package includes simulated annealing, brute force,
		and, for Gaussian graphical models, an application specific
		rank-one update implementation.  Additionally, code for
		estimating Gaussian graphical models is included.  The goal of
		this package is to allow for the efficient estimation of
		change-points in complicated models with high dimensional data.
