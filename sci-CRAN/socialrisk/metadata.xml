		Identifying Patient Social Risk from Administrative Health Care
		Data // Social risks are increasingly becoming a critical
		component of health care research. One of the most common ways
		to identify social needs is by using ICD-10-CM "Z-codes." This
		package identifies social risks using varying taxonomies of
		ICD-10-CM Z-codes from administrative health care data. The
		conceptual taxonomies come from: Centers for Medicare and
		Medicaid Services (2021)
