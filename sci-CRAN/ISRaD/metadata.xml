		Tools and Data for the International Soil Radiocarbon Database //
		This is the central location for data and tools for the
		development, maintenance, analysis, and deployment of the
		International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD). ISRaD was
		developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey
		Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
		This R package provides tools for accessing and manipulating
		ISRaD data, compiling local data using the ISRaD data
		structure, and simple query and reporting functions for ISRaD.
		For more detailed information visit the ISRaD website at:
