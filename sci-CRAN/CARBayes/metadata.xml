		Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit Data //
		Implements a class of univariate and multivariate spatial
		generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with
		inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo
		(MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial,
		Gaussian, multinomial, Poisson or zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP),
		and spatial autocorrelation is modelled by a set of random
		effects that are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR)
		prior distribution. A number of different models are available
		for univariate spatial data, including models with no random
		effects as well as random effects modelled by different types
		of CAR prior, including the BYM model (Besag et al. (1991)
		doi:10.1007/BF00116466), the Leroux model (Leroux et al. (2000)
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-1284-3_4) and the localised model (Lee
		et al. (2015) doi:10.1002/env.2348). Additionally,  a
		multivariate CAR (MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data is
		available, as is a two-level hierarchical model for modelling
		data relating to individuals within areas. Full details are
		given in the vignette accompanying this package. The initial
		creation of this package was supported by the Economic and
		Social Research Council (ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-
		going development has been supported by the Engineering and
		Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1,
		ESRC grant ES/K006460/1, Innovate UK / Natural Environment
		Research Council (NERC) grant NE/N007352/1 and the TB Alliance.
