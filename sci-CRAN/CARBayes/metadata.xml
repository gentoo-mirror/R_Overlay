		Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit Data //
		Implements a class of univariate and multivariate spatial
		generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with
		inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo
		(McMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial,
		Gaussian or Poisson. Spatial autocorrelation is modelled by  a
		set of random effects, which are assigned a conditional
		autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of different
		CAR priors are available for the random effects, including a
		multivariate CAR (MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data.
		Full details are given in the vignette accompanying this
		package. The initial creation of this package was supported by
		the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant
		RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development was supported by the
		Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant
		EP/J017442/1.
