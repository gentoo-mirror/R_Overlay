		Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit Data //
		Implements a class of univariate and multivariate spatial
		generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with
		inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo
		(MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial,
		Gaussian or Poisson, and spatial autocorrelation is modelled by
		a set of random effects that are assigned a conditional
		autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of different
		models are available for univariate spatial data, including
		models with no random effects as well as random effects
		modelled by different types of CAR prior. Additionally,  a
		multivariate CAR (MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data is
		available, as is a two-level hierarchical model for individuals
		within areas. Full details are given in the vignette
		accompanying this package. The initial creation of this package
		was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council
		(ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development has / is
		supported by the Engineering and Physical Science Research
		Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1, ESRC grant ES/K006460/1,
		and Innovate UK / Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
		grant NE/N007352/1.
