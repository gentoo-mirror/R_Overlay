		List Balancing for Reweighting and Population Synthesis //
		Performs iterative proportional updating given a seed table and
		an arbitrary number of marginal distributions. This is commonly
		used in population synthesis, survey raking, matrix
		rebalancing, and other applications. For example, a household
		survey may be weighted to match the known distribution of
		households by size from the census. An origin/ destination trip
		matrix might be balanced to match traffic counts. The approach
		used by this package is based on a paper from Arizona State
		University (Ye, Xin, et. al. (2009) http://citeseerx.ist.psu.ed
		u/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.537.723rep=rep1type=pdf). Some
		enhancements have been made to their work including primary and
		secondary target balance/importance, general marginal
		agreement, and weight restriction.
