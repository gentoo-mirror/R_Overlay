		Estimation of Seed Germination Base Temperature in Thermal
		Modelling // All the seeds do not germinate at a single point
		in time due to physiological mechanisms determined by
		temperature which vary among individual seeds in the
		population. Seeds germinate by following accumulation of
		thermal time in degree days/hours, quantified by multiplying
		the time of germination with excess of base temperature
		required by each seed for its germination, which follows log-
		normal distribution. The theoretical germination course can be
		obtained by regressing the rate of germination at various
		fractions against temperature (Garcia et al., 1982), where the
		fraction-wise regression lines intersect the temperature axis
		at base temperature and the methodology of determining optimum
		base temperature has been described by Ellis et al. (1987).
		This package helps to find the base temperature of seed
		germination using algorithms of Garcia et al. (1982) and Ellis
		et al. (1982) doi:10.1093/JXB/38.6.1033
