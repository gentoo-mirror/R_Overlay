		use in air quality models. Vehicular emissions are estimated by
		a top-down approach, total emissions are calculated using the
		statistical description of the fleet of vehicles, the emission
		is spatially distributed according to satellite images or
		openstreetmap https://www.openstreetmap.org data and then
		distributed temporarily (Vara-Vela et al., 2016,
