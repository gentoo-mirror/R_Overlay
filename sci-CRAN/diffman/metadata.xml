		Detect Differentiation Problems // An algorithm based on graph
		theory tools to detect differentiation problems. A
		differentiation problem occurs when aggregated data are
		disseminated according to two different nomenclatures. By
		making the difference for an additive variable X between an
		aggregate composed of categories of the first nomenclature and
		an other aggregate, included in that first aggregate, composed
		of categories of the second nomenclature, it is sometimes
		possible to derive X on a small aggregate of records which
		could then lead to a break of confidentiality. The purpose of
		this package is to detect the set of aggregates composed of
		categories of the first nomenclature which lead to a
		differentiation problem, when given a confidentiality
		threshold. Reference: Vianney Costemalle (2019) doi:
