		Indices of Productivity Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) //
		Levels and changes of productivity and profitability are
		measured with various indices. In addition to the classic
		Malmquist productivity index, the 'productivity' package
		contains also the multiplicatively complete Fre-Primont,
		Fisher, Laspeyres, Lowe, and Paasche indices. Fre-Primont and
		Lowe indices verify the transitivity property and can therefore
		be used for multilateral or multitemporal comparison. Fisher,
		Laspeyres, Malmquist, and Paasche indices are not transitive
		and are only to be used for binary comparison. All indices can
		also be decomposed into different components, providing
		insightful information on the sources of productivity and
		profitability improvements. In the use of Malmquist
		productivity index, the technological change index can be
		further decomposed into bias technological change components.
		In the case of the Fisher, Laspeyres, Paasche and the
		transitive Fre-Primont and Lowe indices, it is furthermore
		possible to rule out technological change. Deflated shadow
		prices, used in those indices' computations, are also returned.
		The package also allows to prohibit negative technological
		change. All computations are carried out with the nonparametric
		Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and several assumptions
		regarding returns to scale are available. The package allows
		parallel computing as an option, depending on the user's
		computer configuration.
