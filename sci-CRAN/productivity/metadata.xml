		Indices of Productivity Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) //
		Levels and changes of productivity and profitability are
		measured with various indices. The package contains the
		multiplicatively complete Fre-Primont, Fisher, Hicks-Moorsteen,
		Laspeyres, Lowe, and Paasche indices, as well as the classic
		Malmquist productivity index. Fre-Primont and Lowe indices
		verify the transitivity property and can therefore be used for
		multilateral or multitemporal comparison. Fisher, Hicks-
		Moorsteen, Laspeyres, Malmquist, and Paasche indices are not
		transitive and are only to be used for binary comparison. All
		indices can also be decomposed into different components,
		providing insightful information on the sources of productivity
		and profitability changes. In the use of Malmquist productivity
		index, the technological change index can be further decomposed
		into bias technological change components. The package also
		allows to prohibit technological regression (negative
		technological change). In the case of the Fisher, Hicks-
		Moorsteen, Laspeyres, Paasche and the transitive Fre-Primont
		and Lowe indices, it is furthermore possible to rule out
		technological change. Deflated shadow prices can also be
		obtained. Besides, the package allows parallel computing as an
		option, depending on the user's computer configuration. All
		computations are carried out with the nonparametric Data
		Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and several assumptions regarding
		returns to scale are available. All DEA linear programs are
		implemented using 'lp_solve'.
