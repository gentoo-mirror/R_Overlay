		Work with Hyperspectral Data, i.e. Spectra + Meta Information
		(Spatial, Time, Concentration, ...) // Comfortable ways to work
		with hyperspectral data sets. I.e. spatially or time-resolved
		spectra, or spectra with any other kind of information
		associated with each of the spectra. The spectra can be data as
		obtained in XRF, UV/VIS, Fluorescence, AES, NIR, IR, Raman,
		NMR, MS, etc. More generally, any data that is recorded over a
		discretized variable, e.g. absorbance = f(wavelength), stored
		as a vector of absorbance values for discrete wavelengths is
		suitable.
