		Wavelet-ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting // Noise in the
		time-series data significantly affects the accuracy of the
		ARIMA model. Wavelet transformation decomposes the time series
		data into subcomponents to reduce the noise and help to improve
		the model performance. The wavelet-ARIMA model can achieve
		higher prediction accuracy than the traditional ARIMA model.
		This package provides Wavelet-ARIMA model for time series
		forecasting based on the algorithm by Aminghafari and Poggi
		(2012) and Paul and Anjoy (2018) doi:10.1142/S0219691307002002
