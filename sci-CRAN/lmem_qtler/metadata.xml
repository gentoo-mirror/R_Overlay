		Linear Mixed Effects Models for QTL Mapping for Multienvironment
		and Multitrait Analysis // Performs QTL mapping analysis for
		balanced and for multi-environment and multi-trait analysis
		using mixed models. Balanced population, single trait, single
		environment QTL mapping is performed through marker-regression
		(Haley and Knott (1992) DOI:10.1038/hdy.1992.131, Martinez and
		Curnow (1992) DOI:10.1007/BF00222330, while multi-environment
		and multi-trait QTL mapping is performed through linear mixed
		models. These functions could use any of the following
		populations: double haploid, F2, recombinant inbred lines,
		back-cross, and 4-way crosses. Performs a Single Marker
		Analysis, a Single Interval Mapping, or a Composite Interval
		Mapping analysis, and then constructs a final model with all of
		the relevant QTL.
