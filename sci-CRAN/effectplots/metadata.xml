		Effect Plots // High-performance implementation of various effect
		plots useful for regression and probabilistic classification
		tasks.  The package includes partial dependence plots
		(Friedman, 2021, doi:10.1214/aos/1013203451), accumulated local
		effect plots and M-plots (both from Apley and Zhu, 2016,
		doi:10.1111/rssb.12377), as well as plots that describe the
		statistical associations between model response and features.
		It supports visualizations with either 'ggplot2' or 'plotly',
		and is compatible with most models, including 'Tidymodels',
		models wrapped in 'DALEX' explainers, or models with case
		weights.
