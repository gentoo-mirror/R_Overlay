		Quantifying Evolution and Selection on Complex Traits //
		Functions are provided for quantifying evolution and selection
		on complex traits. The package implements effective handling
		and analysis algorithms scaled for genome-wide data and
		calculates a composite statistic, denoted Ghat, which is used
		to test for selection on a trait. The package provides a number
		of simple examples for handling and analysing the genome data
		and visualising the output and results. Beissinger et al.,
