		Semiparametric Regression Analysis of Interval-Censored Data
		using Penalized Splines // Currently incorporate the
		generalized odds-rate model (a type of linear transformation
		model) for interval-censored data based on penalized monotonic
		B-Spline. More methods under other semiparametric models such
		as cure model or additive model will be included in future
		versions. For more details see Lu, M., Liu, Y., Li, C. and Sun,
		J. (2019) arXiv:1912.11703.
