		Miscellaneous Utilities for Extreme Value Analysis // Provides
		utility functions and objects for Extreme Value Analysis. These
		include probability functions with their exact derivatives
		w.r.t. the parameters that can be used for estimation and
		inference, even with censored observations. The transformations
		exchanging the two parameterizations of Peaks Over Threshold
		(POT) models: Poisson-GP and Point-Process are also provided
		with their derivatives.
