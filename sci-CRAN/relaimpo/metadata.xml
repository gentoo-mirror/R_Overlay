		Relative Importance of Regressors in Linear Models // Provides
		several metrics for assessing relative importance in linear
		models. These can be printed, plotted and bootstrapped. The
		recommended metric is lmg, which provides a decomposition of
		the model explained variance into non-negative contributions.
		There is a version of this package available that additionally
		provides a new and also recommended metric called pmvd. If you
		are a non-US user, you can download this extended version from
		Ulrike Groempings web site.
