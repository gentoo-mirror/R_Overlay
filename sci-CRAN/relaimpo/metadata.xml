		Relative importance of regressors in linear models // relaimpo
		provides several metrics for assessing relative importance in
		linear models. These can be printed, plotted and bootstrapped.
		The recommended metric is lmg, which provides a decomposition
		of the model explained variance into non-negative
		contributions. There is a version of this package available
		that additionally provides a new and also recommended metric
		called pmvd. If you are a non-US user, you can download this
		extended version from Ulrike Groempings web site.
