		Automated C Code Generation for 'deSolve', 'bvpSolve' and
		'Sundials' // Generates all necessary C functions allowing the
		user to work with the compiled-code interface of ode() and
		bvptwp(). The implementation supports "forcings" and "events".
		Also provides functions to symbolically compute Jacobians,
		sensitivity equations and adjoint sensitivities being the basis
		for sensitivity analysis. Alternatively to 'deSolve', the
		Sundials 'CVODES' solver is implemented for computation of
		model sensitivities.
