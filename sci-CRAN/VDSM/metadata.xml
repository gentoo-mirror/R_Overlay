		Visualization of Distribution of Selected Model // Although model
		selection is ubiquitous in scientific discovery, the stability
		and uncertainty of the selected model is often hard to
		evaluate. How to characterize the random behavior of the model
		selection procedure is the key to understand and quantify the
		model selection uncertainty. This R package offers several
		graphical tools to visualize the distribution of the selected
		model. For example, Gplot(), Hplot(), VDSM_scatterplot() and
		VDSM_heatmap(). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
		attempt to visualize such a distribution. About what
		distribution of selected model is and how it work please see
		Qin,Y.and Wang,L. (2021) "Visualization of Model Selection
		Uncertainty" https://homepages.uc.edu/~qinyn/VDSM/VDSM.html.
