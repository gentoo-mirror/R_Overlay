		Factor Analysis for Multiple Testing (FAMT) : simultaneous tests
		under dependence in high-dimensional data // The method
		proposed in this package takes into account the impact of
		dependence on the multiple testing procedures for high-
		throughput data as proposed by Friguet et al. (2009). The
		common information shared by all the variables is modeled by a
		factor analysis structure. The number of factors considered in
		the model is chosen to reduce the false discoveries variance in
		multiple tests. The model parameters are estimated thanks to an
		EM algorithm. Adjusted tests statistics are derived, as well as
		the associated p-values. The proportion of true null hypotheses
		(an important parameter when controlling the false discovery
		rate) is also estimated from the FAMT model. Graphics are
		proposed to interpret and describe the factors.
