		Machine Learning Algorithms for Multivariate Time Series // An
		implementation of several machine learning algorithms for
		multivariate time series. The package includes functions
		allowing the execution of clustering, classification or outlier
		detection methods, among others. It also incorporates a
		collection of multivariate time series datasets which can be
		used to analyse the performance of new proposed algorithms.
		Practitioners from a broad variety of fields could benefit from
		the general framework provided by 'mlmts'.
