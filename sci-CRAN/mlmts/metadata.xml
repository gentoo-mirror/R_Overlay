		Machine Learning Algorithms for Multivariate Time Series // An
		implementation of several machine learning algorithms for
		multivariate time series. The package includes functions
		allowing the execution of clustering, classification or outlier
		detection methods, among others. It also incorporates a
		collection of multivariate time series datasets which can be
		used to analyse the performance of new proposed algorithms.
		Some of these datasets are stored in GitHub data packages
		'ueadata1' to 'ueadata8'. To access these data packages, run
		'install.packages(c('ueadata1', 'ueadata2', 'ueadata3',
		'ueadata4', 'ueadata5', 'ueadata6', 'ueadata7', 'ueadata8'),
		repos='https://anloor7.github.io/drat/')'. The installation
		takes a couple of minutes but we strongly encourage the users
		to do it if they want to have available all datasets of mlmts.
		Practitioners from a broad variety of fields could benefit from
		the general framework provided by 'mlmts'.
