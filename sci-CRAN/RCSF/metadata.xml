		Airborne LiDAR Filtering Method Based on Cloth Simulation //
		Cloth Simulation Filter (CSF) is an airborne LiDAR (Light
		Detection and Ranging) ground points filtering algorithm  which
		is based on cloth simulation. It tries to simulate the
		interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding
		LiDAR points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be
		determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface.
