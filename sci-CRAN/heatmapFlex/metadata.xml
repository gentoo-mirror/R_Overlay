		Tools to Generate Flexible Heatmaps // A set of tools supporting
		more flexible heatmaps. The graphics is grid-like using the old
		graphics system. The main function is heatmap.n2(), which is a
		wrapper around the various functions constructing individual
		parts of the heatmap, like sidebars, picket plots, legends etc.
		The function supports zooming and splitting, i.e., having
		(unlimited) small heatmaps underneath each other in one plot
		deriving from the same data set, e.g., clustered and ordered by
		a supervised clustering method.
