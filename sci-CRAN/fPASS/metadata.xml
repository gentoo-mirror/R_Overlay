		Power and Sample Size for Projection Test under Repeated Measures
		// Computes the power and sample size (PASS) required to test
		for the difference in the mean function between two groups
		under a repeatedly measured longitudinal or sparse functional
		design. See the manuscript by Koner and Luo (2023)
		https://salilkoner.github.io/assets/PASS_manuscript.pdf for
		details of the PASS formula and computational details. The
		details of the testing procedure for univariate and
		multivariate response are presented in Wang (2021)
		doi:10.1214/21-EJS1802 and Koner and Luo (2023)
		arXiv:2302.05612 respectively.
