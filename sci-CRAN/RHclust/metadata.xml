		Vector in Partition // Non-parametric clustering of joint pattern
		multi-genetic/epigenetic factors. This package contains
		functions designed to cluster subjects based on gene features
		including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA
		methylation (CPG), gene expression (GE), and covariate data.
		The novel concept follows the general K-means (Hartigan and
		Wong (1979) doi:10.2307/2346830 framework but uses weighted
		Euclidean distances across the gene features to cluster
		subjects. This approach is unique in that it attempts to
		capture all pairwise interactions in an effort to cluster based
		on their complex biological interactions.
