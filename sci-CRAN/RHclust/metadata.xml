		Vectors in Partitioning // Non-parametric clustering of joint
		pattern multi-genetic/epigenetic factors. The goal of this
		package is to cluster subjects based on gene features including
		single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA methylation (CPG),
		and gene expression (GE). The novel concept follows the general
		K-means (Hartigan and Wong (1979) doi:10.2307/2346830 framework
		but uses weighted Euclidean distances across the gene features
		to cluster subjects. This approach is unique in that it
		attempts to capture all pairwise interactions in an effort to
		cluster based on their complex biological interactions.
