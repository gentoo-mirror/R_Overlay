		Easy Interface for Clustering a Set of Documents and Exploring
		Group- Based Patterns // Provides an interface to perform
		cluster analysis on a corpus of text. Interfaces to Quanteda to
		assemble text corpuses easily. Deviationalizes text vectors
		prior to clustering using technique described by Sherin
		(Sherin, B. [2013]. A computational study of commonsense
		science: An exploration in the automated analysis of clinical
		interview data. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 22(4),
		600-638. Chicago. doi:10.1080/10508406.2013.836654). Uses
		cosine similarity as distance metric for two stage clustering
		process, involving Ward's algorithm hierarchical agglomerative
		clustering, and k-means clustering. Selects optimal number of
		clusters to maximize "variance explained" by clusters, adjusted
		by the number of clusters. Provides plotted output of
		clustering results as well as printed output. Assesses "model
		fit" of clustering solution to a set of preexisting groups in
		dataset.
