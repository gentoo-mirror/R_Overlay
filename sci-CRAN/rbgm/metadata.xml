		Tools for 'Box Geometry Model' (BGM) Files and Topology for the
		Atlantis Ecosystem Model // Facilities for working with
		Atlantis box-geometry model (BGM) files. Atlantis is a
		deterministic, biogeochemical, whole-of-ecosystem model.
		Functions are provided to read from BGM files directly,
		preserving their internal topology, as well as helper functions
		to generate spatial data from these mesh forms. This
		functionality aims to simplify the creation and modification of
		box and geometry as well as the ability to integrate with other
		data sources.
