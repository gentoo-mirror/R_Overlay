		Tools for 'Box Geometry Model' (BGM) Files and Topology for the
		Atlantis Ecosystem Model // Facilities for working with
		Atlantis box-geometry model (BGM) files. Atlantis is a
		deterministic, biogeochemical, whole-of-ecosystem model.
		Functions are provided to read from BGM files directly,
		preserving their internal topology, as well as helper functions
		to generate 'Spatial' objects. This functionality aims to
		simplify the creation and modification of box and geometry as
		well as the ability to integrate with other data sources.
