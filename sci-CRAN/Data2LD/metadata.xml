		Functional Data Analysis with Linear Differential Equations //
		Provides methods for using differential equations as modelling
		objects as described in J. Ramsay G. and Hooker (2017,ISBN
		978-1-4939-7188-6) Dynamic Data Analysis, New York: Springer.
		Data sets and script files for analyzing many of the examples
		in this book are included. This version corrects bugs and adds
		two new demos, CruiseControl and monotoneSmoothDemo. This
		version incorporates a new system for indexing coefficient list
		objects. The step of setting up a set of coefficient list
		objects has been eliminated and the functions make.Coef() and
		coefCheck have been dropped. 'Matlab' versions of the code and
		sample analyses are available by ftp from the website.  There
		you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and
		sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions
		for installation and some additional information.
