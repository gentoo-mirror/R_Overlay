		Functional Data Analysis with Linear Differential Equations //
		Package 'Data2LD' was developed to support functional data
		analysis using the functions in package 'fda'. The functions in
		this package are designed for the use of differential equations
		as modelling objects as described in J. Ramsay G. and Hooker
		(2017,ISBN 978-1-4939-7188-6) Dynamic Data Analysis, New York:
		Springer.  The package includes data sets and script files for
		analyzing many of the examples in this book. 'Matlab' versions
		of the code and sample analyses are available by ftp from
		http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/Data2LD/.  There
		you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and
		sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions
		for installation and some additional information.
