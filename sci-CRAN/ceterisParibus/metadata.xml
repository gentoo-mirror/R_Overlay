		Ceteris Paribus Profiles // Ceteris Paribus Profiles (What-If
		Plots) are designed to present model responses around selected
		points in a feature space. For example around a single
		prediction for an interesting observation. Plots are designed
		to work in a model-agnostic fashion, they are working for any
		predictive Machine Learning model and allow for model
		comparisons. Ceteris Paribus Plots supplement the Break Down
		Plots from 'breakDown' package.
