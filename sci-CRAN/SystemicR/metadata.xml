		Monitoring Systemic Risk // The past decade has demonstrated an
		increased need to better understand risks leading to systemic
		crises. This framework offers scholars, practitioners and
		policymakers a useful toolbox to explore such risks in
		financial systems. Specifically, this framework provides
		popular econometric and network measures to monitor systemic
		risk and to measure the consequences of regulatory decisions.
		These systemic risk measures are based on the frameworks of
		Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) doi:10.1257/aer.20120555 and
		Billio, Getmansky, Lo and Pelizzon (2012)
