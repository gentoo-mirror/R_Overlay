		A 'Java' Platform Integration for 'R' with Programming Languages
		'Groovy', 'JavaScript', 'JRuby' ('Ruby'), 'Jython' ('Python'),
		and 'Kotlin' // Provides a high-level integration for the
		'Java' platform that makes 'Java' objects easy to use from
		within 'R'; provides a unified interface to integrate 'R' with
		several programming languages; and features extensive data
		exchange between 'R' and 'Java'. The 'jsr223'-supported
		programming languages include 'Groovy', 'JavaScript', 'JRuby'
		('Ruby'), 'Jython' ('Python'), and 'Kotlin'. Any of these
		languages can use and extend 'Java' classes in natural syntax.
		Furthermore, solutions developed in any of the
		'jsr223'-supported languages are also accessible to 'R'
		developers. The 'jsr223' package also features callbacks,
		script compiling, and string interpolation. In all, 'jsr223'
		significantly extends the computing capabilities of the 'R'
		software environment.
