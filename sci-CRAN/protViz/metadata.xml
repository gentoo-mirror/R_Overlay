		Visualizing and Analyzing Mass Spectrometry Related Data in
		Proteomics // This R package helps with quality checks,
		visualizations and analysis of mass spectrometry data, coming
		from proteomics experiments. The package is developed, tested
		and used at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich. We use this
		package mainly for prototyping, teaching, and having fun with
		proteomics data. But it can also be used to do data analysis
		for small scale data sets.
