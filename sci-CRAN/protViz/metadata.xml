		Visualizing and Analyzing Mass Spectrometry Related Data in
		Proteomics // Helps with quality checks, visualizations and
		analysis of mass spectrometry data, coming from proteomics
		experiments. The package is developed, tested and used at the
		Functional Genomics Center Zurich. We use this package mainly
		for prototyping, teaching, and having fun with proteomics data.
		But it can also be used to do data analysis for small scale
		data sets.
