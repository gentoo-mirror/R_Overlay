		Multivariate Functional Additive Mixed Models // An
		implementation for multivariate functional additive mixed
		models (multiFAMM), see Volkmann et al. (2021,
		arXiv:2103.06606). It builds on developed methods for
		univariate sparse functional regression models and multivariate
		functional principal component analysis. This package contains
		the function to run a multiFAMM and some convenience functions
		useful when working with large models. An additional package on
		GitHub contains more convenience functions to reproduce the
		analyses of the corresponding paper
		(https://github.com/alexvolkmann/multifammPaper).
