		Fast Multivariate Log-Concave Density Estimation // A fast solver
		for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a multivariate
		log-concave probability function. Given a sample X, it
		estimates a non-parametric density function whose logarithm is
		a concave function. Many well-known parametric densities belong
		to that class, among them the normal density, the uniform
		density, the exponential distribution and many more. This
		package provides functions for the estimation of a log-concave
		density and a mixture of log-concave densities in multiple
		dimensions. While being similar to the package LogConcDEAD,
		fmlogcondens provides much fast run times for large samples (=
		250 points). As a reference see Fabian Rathke, Christoph Schnrr
		(2015), doi:10.1515/auom-2015-0053.
