		Covariate Specific Treatment Effect (CSTE) Curve // A uniform
		statistical inferential tool in making individualized treatment
		decisions, which implements the methods of Ma et al.
		(2017)DOI:10.1177/0962280214541724 and Guo et al.
		(2021)DOI:10.1080/01621459.2020.1865167. It uses a flexible
		semiparametric modeling strategy for heterogeneous treatment
		effect estimation in high-dimensional settings and can gave
		valid confidence bands. Based on it, one can find the subgroups
		of patients that benefit from each treatment, thereby making
