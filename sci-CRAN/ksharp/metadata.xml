		Cluster Sharpening // Clustering typically assigns data points
		into discrete groups, but the clusters can sometimes be
		indistinct. Cluster sharpening adjusts an existing clustering
		to create contrast between groups. This package provides a
		general interface for cluster sharpening along with several
		implementations based on different excision criteria.
