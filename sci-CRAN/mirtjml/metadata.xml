		Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation for High-Dimensional Item
		Factor Analysis // Provides constrained joint maximum
		likelihood estimation algorithms for item factor analysis (IFA)
		based on multidimensional item response theory models. So far,
		we provide functions for exploratory and confirmatory IFA based
		on the multidimensional two parameter logistic (M2PL) model for
		binary response data. Comparing with traditional estimation
		methods for IFA, the methods implemented in this package scale
		better to data with large numbers of respondents, items, and
		latent factors. The computation is facilitated by
		multiprocessing 'OpenMP' API. For more information, please

		Likelihood Estimation for High-Dimensional Exploratory Item
