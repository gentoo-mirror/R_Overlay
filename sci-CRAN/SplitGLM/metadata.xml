		Split Generalized Linear Models // Functions to compute split
		generalized linear models. The approach fits generalized linear
		models that split the covariates into groups. The optimal split
		of the variables into groups and the regularized estimation of
		the coefficients are performed by minimizing an objective
		function that encourages sparsity within each group and
		diversity among them. Example applications can be found in
		Christidis et al. (2021) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2102.08591.
