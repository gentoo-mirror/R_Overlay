		Model Order Selection for Clustering // Stability based methods
		for model order selection in clustering problems (Valentini, G
		(2007), doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl600). Using multiple
		perturbations of the data the stability of clustering solutions
		is assessed. Different perturbations may be used: resampling
		techniques, random projections and noise injection. Stability
		measures for the estimate of clustering solutions and
		statistical tests to assess their significance are provided.
