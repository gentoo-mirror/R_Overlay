		Stochastic Quasi-Gradient Differential Evolution Optimization //
		An optim-style implementation of the Stochastic Quasi-Gradient
		Differential Evolution (SQG-DE) optimization algorithm first
		published by Sala, Baldanzini, and Pierini (2018;
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-72926-8_27). This optimization algorithm
		fuses the robustness of the population-based global
		optimization algorithm "Differential Evolution" with the
		efficiency of gradient-based optimization. The derivative-free
		algorithm uses population members to build stochastic gradient
		estimates, without any additional objective function
		evaluations. Sala, Baldanzini, and Pierini argue this algorithm
		is useful for 'difficult optimization problems under a tight
		function evaluation budget.' This package can run SQG-DE in
		parallel and sequentially.
