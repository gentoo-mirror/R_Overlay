		Generalized Linear Mixed Model Association Tests // Perform
		association tests using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)
		in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing
		association studies. First, GMMAT fits a GLMM with covariate
		adjustment and random effects to account for population
		structure and familial or cryptic relatedness. For GWAS, GMMAT
		performs score tests for each genetic variant as proposed in
		Chen et al. (2016) DOI:10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.02.012. For
		candidate gene studies, GMMAT can also perform Wald tests to
		get the effect size estimate for each genetic variant. For rare
		variant analysis from sequencing association studies, GMMAT
		performs the variant Set Mixed Model Association Tests (SMMAT)
		as proposed in Chen et al. (2019)
		DOI:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.12.012, including the burden test, the
		sequence kernel association test (SKAT), SKAT-O and an
		efficient hybrid test of the burden test and SKAT, based on
		user-defined variant sets.
