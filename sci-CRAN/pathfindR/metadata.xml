		Enrichment Analysis Utilizing Active Subnetworks // Enrichment
		analysis enables researchers to uncover mechanisms underlying a
		phenotype. However, conventional methods for enrichment
		analysis do not take into account protein-protein interaction
		information, resulting in incomplete conclusions. pathfindR is
		a tool for enrichment analysis utilizing active subnetworks.
		The main function identifies active subnetworks in a protein-
		protein interaction network using a user-provided list of genes
		and associated p values. It then performs enrichment analyses
		on the identified subnetworks, identifying enriched terms (i.e.
		pathways or, more broadly, gene sets) that possibly underlie
		the phenotype of interest. pathfindR also offers
		functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and identify
		representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched
		terms per sample and to visualize analysis results. The
		enrichment, clustering and other methods implemented in
		pathfindR are described in detail in Ulgen E, Ozisik O,
		Sezerman OU. 2019. pathfindR: An R Package for Comprehensive
		Identification of Enriched Pathways in Omics Data Through
		Active Subnetworks. Front. Genet. doi:10.3389/fgene.2019.00858.
