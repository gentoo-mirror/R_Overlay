		Pathway Enrichment Analysis Utilizing Active Subnetworks //
		Pathway enrichment analysis enables researchers to uncover
		mechanisms underlying the phenotype. pathfindR is a tool for
		pathway enrichment analysis utilizing active subnetworks. It
		identifies active subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction
		network using user-provided a list of genes. It performs
		pathway enrichment analyses on the identified subnetworks.
		pathfindR also offers functionality to cluster enriched
		pathways and identify representative pathways. The method is
		described in detail in Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2018.
