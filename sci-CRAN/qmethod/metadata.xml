		Analysis of Subjective Perspectives Using Q Methodology //
		Analysis of Q methodology, used to identify distinct
		perspectives existing within a group. This methodology is used
		across social, health and environmental sciences to understand
		diversity of attitudes, discourses, or decision-making styles
		(for more information, see https://qmethod.org/). A single
		function runs the full analysis. Each step can be run
		separately using the corresponding functions: for automatic
		flagging of Q-sorts (manual flagging is optional), for
		statement scores, for distinguishing and consensus statements,
		and for general characteristics of the factors. The package
		allows to choose either principal components or centroid factor
		extraction, manual or automatic flagging, a number of
		mathematical methods for rotation (or none), and a number of
		correlation coefficients for the initial correlation matrix,
		among many other options. Additional functions are available to
		import and export data (from raw *.CSV, 'HTMLQ' and 'FlashQ'
		*.CSV, 'PQMethod' *.DAT and 'easy-htmlq' *.JSON files), to
		print and plot, to import raw data from individual *.CSV files,
		and to make printable cards. The package also offers functions
		to print Q cards and to generate Q distributions for study
		administration. See further details in the package
		documentation, and in the web pages below, which include a
		cookbook, guidelines for more advanced analysis (how to perform
		manual flagging or change the sign of factors), data
		management, and a beta graphical user interface for online and
		offline use.
