		An Extensible Approach to Flux Balance Analysis // A simple
		package for Flux Balance Analysis and related metabolic
		modeling techniques. Functions are provided for: parsing models
		in tabular format, converting parsed metabolic models to input
		formats for common linear programming solvers, and evaluating
		and applying gene-protein-reaction mappings. In addition, there
		are wrappers to parse a model, select a solver, find the
		metabolic fluxes, and return the results applied to the
		original model. Compared to other packages in this field, this
		package puts a much heavier focus on providing reusable
		components that can be used in the design of new implementation
		of new techniques, in particular those that involve large
		parameter sweeps.
