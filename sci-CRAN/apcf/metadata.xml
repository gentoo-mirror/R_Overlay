		Adapted Pair Correlation Function // The adapted pair correlation
		function transfers the concept of the pair correlation function
		from point patterns to patterns of objects of finite size and
		irregular shape (e.g. lakes within a country).  The pair
		correlation function describes the spatial distribution of
		objects, e.g. random, aggregated or regularly spaced. This is a
		reimplementation of the method suggested by Nuske et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1016/j.foreco.2009.09.050 using the library 'GEOS'.
