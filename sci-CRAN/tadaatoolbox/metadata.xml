		Helpers for Data Analysis and Presentation Focused on Undergrad
		Psychology // Contains functions for the easy display of
		statistical tests as well as some convenience functions for
		recoding or data cleanup. It is meant to ease existing
		workflows with packages like 'sjPlot', 'dplyr', and 'ggplot2'.
		The primary components are the functions prefixed with
		'tadaa_', which are built to work in an interactive
		environment, but also print tidy markdown tables powered by
		'pixiedist' for the creation of 'RMarkdown' reports.
