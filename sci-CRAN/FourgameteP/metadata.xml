		FourGamete Test // The four-gamete test is based on the infinite-
		sites model which assumes that the probability of the same
		mutation occurring twice (recurrent or parallel mutations) and
		the probability of a mutation back to the original state
		(reverse mutations) are close to zero. Without these types of
		mutations, the only explanation for observing the four dilocus
		genotypes (example below) is recombination (Hudson and Kaplan
		1985, Genetics 111:147-164). Thus, the presence of all four
		gametes is also called phylogenetic incompatibility.
