		Fit Interpretable Machine Learning Models and Explain Blackbox
		Machine Learning // Package for training interpretable machine
		learning models and explaining blackbox systems. Historically,
		the most interpretable machine learning models were not very
		accurate, and the most accurate models were not very
		interpretable. Microsoft Research has developed an algorithm
		called the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) which has both
		high accuracy and interpretable characteristics. EBM uses
		machine learning techniques like bagging and boosting to
		breathe new life into traditional GAMs (Generalized Additive
		Models). This makes them as accurate as random forests and
		gradient boosted trees, and also enhances their intelligibility
		and editability. Details on the EBM algorithm can be found in
		the paper by Rich Caruana, Yin Lou, Johannes Gehrke, Paul Koch,
		Marc Sturm, and Noemie Elhadad (2015,
		doi:10.1145/2783258.2788613).
