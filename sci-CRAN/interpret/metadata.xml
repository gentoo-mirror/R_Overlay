		Fit Interpretable Models and Explain Blackbox Machine Learning //
		Machine Learning package for training interpretable models and
		explaining blackbox systems. Historically, the most
		intelligible models were not very accurate, and the most
		accurate models were not intelligible. Microsoft Research has
		developed an algorithm called the Explainable Boosting Machine
		(EBM) which has both high accuracy and intelligibility. EBM
		uses machine learning techniques like bagging and boosting to
		breathe new life into traditional GAMs (Generalized Additive
		Models). This makes them as accurate as random forests and
		gradient boosted trees, and also enhances their intelligibility
		and editability. Details on the EBM algorithm can be found in
		the paper by Rich Caruana, Yin Lou, Johannes Gehrke, Paul Koch,
		Marc Sturm, and Noemie Elhadad (2015,
		doi:10.1145/2783258.2788613).
