		creation of some specific braids, group operations, free
		reduction, and Bronfman polynomials. Braid theory has
		applications in fluid mechanics and quantum physics. The code
		is adapted from the 'Haskell' library 'combinat', and is based
		on Birman and Brendle (2005) doi:10.48550/arXiv.math/0409205.
