		Hybrid Design for Phase I Dose-Finding Studies // The Hybrid
		design is a combination of model-assisted design (e.g., the
		modified Toxicity Probability Interval design) with dose-
		toxicity model-based design for phase I dose-finding studies.
		The hybrid design controls the overdosing toxicity well and
		leads to a recommended dose closer to the true maximum
		tolerated dose (MTD) due to its ability to calibrate for an
		intermediate dose. More details can be found in Liao et al.
