		Methods for Temporal Disaggregation and Interpolation of Time
		Series // Temporal disaggregation methods are used to
		disaggregate and interpolate a low frequency time series to a
		higher frequency series, where either the sum, the mean, the
		first or the last value of the resulting high frequency series
		is consistent with the low frequency series. Temporal
		disaggregation can be performed with or without one or more
		high frequency indicator series. Contains the methods of Chow-
		Lin, Santos-Silva-Cardoso, Fernandez, Litterman, Denton and
		Denton-Cholette, summarized in Sax and Steiner (2013)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2013-028. Supports most R time series classes.
