		Novel Methods for Reproduction Number Estimation, Back-
		Calculation, and Forecasting // A collection of functions
		related to novel methods for estimating R(t), created by the
		lab of Professor Laura White. Currently implemented methods
		include two-step Bayesian back-calculation and now-casting for
		line-list data with missing reporting delays, adapted in 'STAN'
		from Li (2021) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009210, and
		calculation of time-varying reproduction number assuming a flux
		between various adjacent states, adapted into 'STAN' from Zhou
		(2021) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010434.
