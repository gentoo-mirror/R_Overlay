		Penalization in Large Scale Generalized Linear Array Models //
		Efficient design matrix free  lasso penalized estimation in
		large scale 2 and 3-dimensional generalized linear array model
		framework. The procedure is based on the gdpg algorithm from
		Lund et al. (2017) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1279548. Currently
		Lasso or Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) penalized
		estimation is possible for the following models: The Gaussian
		model with identity link, the Binomial model with logit link,
		the Poisson model with log link and the Gamma model with log
		link. It is also possible to include a  component in the model
		with non-tensor design e.g an intercept. Also provided are
		functions, glamlassoRR() and glamlassoS(), fitting special
		cases of GLAMs.
