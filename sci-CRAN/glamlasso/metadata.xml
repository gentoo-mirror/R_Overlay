		Penalization in Large Scale Generalized Linear Array Models //
		Functions capable of performing  efficient design matrix free
		penalized estimation in large scale 2 and 3-dimensional
		generalized linear array model framework. The generic
		glamlasso() function solves the penalized maximum likelihood
		estimation (PMLE) problem in a pure generalized linear array
		model (GLAM) as well as in a GLAM containing a non-tensor
		component. Currently Lasso or Smoothly Clipped Absolute
		Deviation (SCAD) penalized estimation is possible for the
		followings models: The Gaussian model with identity link, the
		Binomial model with logit link, the Poisson model with log link
		and the Gamma model with log link. Furthermore this package
		also contains two  functions  that can be used to fit special
		cases of GLAMs, see glamlassoRR() and glamlassoS(). The
		procedure underlying these functions is based on the gdpg
		algorithm from Lund et al. (2017)
