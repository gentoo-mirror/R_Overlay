		Decision Curve Analysis for Model Evaluation // Diagnostic and
		prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of
		accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-
		analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes, but
		often require collection of additional information may be
		cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result.
		Decision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and
		comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical
		consequences, requires only the data set on which the models
		are tested, and can be applied to models that have either
		continuous or dichotomous results. See the following references
		for details on the methods: Vickers (2006)
