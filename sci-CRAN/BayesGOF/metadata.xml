		Bayesian Modeling via Goodness of Fit // Non-parametric method
		for learning prior distribution starting with parametric
		(subjective) prior.  It performs four interconnected tasks: (i)
		characterizes the uncertainty of the elicited prior; (ii)
		exploratory diagnostic for checking prior-data conflict; (iii)
		computes the final statistical prior density estimate; and (iv)
		performs macro- and micro-inference. Primary reference is
		Mukhopadhyay, S. and Fletcher, D. (2017, Technical Report).
