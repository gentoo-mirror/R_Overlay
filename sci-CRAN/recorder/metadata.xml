		Toolkit to Validate New Data for a Predictive Model // A
		lightweight toolkit to validate new observations when computing
		their predictions with a predictive model. The validation
		process consists of two steps: (1) record relevant statistics
		and meta data of the variables in the original training data
		for the predictive model and (2) use these data to run a set of
		basic validation tests on the new set of observations.
