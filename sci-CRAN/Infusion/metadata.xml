		Inference Using Simulation // Implements functions for
		simulation-based inference. In particular, implements functions
		to perform likelihood inference from data summaries whose
		distributions are simulated. A first approach was described in
		Rousset et al. (2017 doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12627) but the
		package implements more advanced methods.
