		R Source Code Similarity Evaluation by Similarity Coefficients //
		Evaluates R source codes by variable and/or functions names.
		Similar source codes should deliver similarity coefficients
		near one. Since neither the frequency nor the order of the used
		names is considered, a manual inspection of the R source code
		is required to check for similarity. Possible use cases include
		detection of code clones for improving software quality and of
		plagiarism amongst students' assignments.
