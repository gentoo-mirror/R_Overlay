		Descriptive mAchine Learning EXplanations // Machine Learning
		(ML) models are widely used and have various applications in
		classification or regression. Models created with boosting,
		bagging, stacking or similar techniques are often used due to
		their high performance, but such black-box models usually lack
		of interpretability. 'DALEX' package contains various
		explainers that help to understand the link between input
		variables and model output. The single_variable() explainer
		extracts conditional response of a model as a function of a
		single selected variable. It is a wrapper over packages 'pdp'
		and 'ALEPlot'. The single_prediction() explainer attributes
		arts of model prediction to articular variables used in the
		model. It is a wrapper over 'breakDown' package. The
		variable_dropout() explainer assess variable importance based
		on consecutive permutations. All these explainers can be
		plotted with generic plot() function and compared across
		different models.
