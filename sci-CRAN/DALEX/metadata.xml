		moDel Agnostic Language for Exploration and eXplanation // Any
		unverified black box model is the path to failure. Opaqueness
		leads to distrust. Distrust leads to ignoration. Ignoration
		leads to rejection. DALEX package xrays any model and helps to
		explore and explain its behaviour. Machine Learning (ML) models
		are widely used and have various applications in classification
		or regression. Models created with boosting, bagging, stacking
		or similar techniques are often used due to their high
		performance. But such black-box models usually lack direct
		interpretability. DALEX package contains various methods that
		help to understand the link between input variables and model
		output. Implemented methods help to explore the model on the
		level of a single instance as well as a level of the whole
		dataset. All model explainers are model agnostic and can be
		compared across different models. DALEX package is the
		cornerstone for 'DrWhy.AI' universe of packages for visual
		model exploration. Find more details in (Biecek 2018)
