		Descriptive mAchine Learning EXplanations // Machine Learning
		(ML) models are widely used and have various applications in
		classification or regression. Models created with boosting,
		bagging, stacking or similar techniques are often used due to
		their high performance, but such black-box models usually lack
		of interpretability. DALEX package contains various explainers
		that help to understand the link between input variables and
		model output. The single_variable() explainer extracts
		conditional response of a model as a function of a single
		selected variable. It is a wrapper over packages 'pdp'
		(Greenwell 2017) doi:10.32614/RJ-2017-016, 'ALEPlot' (Apley
		2018) arXiv:1612.08468  and 'factorMerger' (Sitko and Biecek
		2017) arXiv:1709.04412. The single_prediction() explainer
		attributes parts of a model prediction to particular variables
		used in the model. It is a wrapper over 'breakDown' package
		(Staniak and Biecek 2018) doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-072. The
		variable_dropout() explainer calculates variable importance
		scores based on variable shuffling (Fisher at al. 2018)
		arXiv:1801.01489. All these explainers can be plotted with
		generic plot() function and compared across different models.
		'DALEX' is a part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe (Biecek 2018)
		arXiv:1806.08915.
