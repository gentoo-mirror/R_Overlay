		Datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen // The Datasaurus Dozen is a
		set of datasets with the same summary statistics. They retain
		the same summary statistics despite having radically different
		distributions. The datasets represent a larger and quirkier
		object lesson that is typically taught via Anscombe's Quartet
		(available in the 'datasets' package). Anscombe's Quartet
		contains four very different distributions with the same
		summary statistics and as such highlights the value of
		visualisation in understanding data, over and above summary
		statistics. As well as being an engaging variant on the
		Quartet, the data is generated in a novel way. The simulated
		annealing process used to derive datasets from the original
		Datasaurus is detailed in "Same Stats, Different Graphs:
		Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical
		Statistics through Simulated Annealing"
