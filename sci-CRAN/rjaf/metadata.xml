		Regularized Joint Assignment Forest with Treatment Arm Clustering
		// Personalized assignment to one of many treatment arms via
		regularized and clustered joint assignment forests as described
		in Ladhania, Spiess, Ungar, and Wu (2023)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2311.00577. The algorithm pools information
		across treatment arms: it considers a regularized forest-based
		assignment algorithm based on greedy recursive partitioning
		that shrinks effect estimates across arms; and it incorporates
		a clustering scheme that combines treatment arms with
		consistently similar outcomes.
