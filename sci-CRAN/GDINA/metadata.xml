		The Generalized DINA Model Framework // A set of psychometric
		tools for cognitive diagnosis modeling based on the generalized
		deterministic inputs, noisy and gate (G-DINA) model by de la
		Torre (2011) DOI:10.1007/s11336-011-9207-7 and its extensions,
		including the sequential G-DINA model by Ma and de la Torre
		(2016) DOI:10.1111/bmsp.12070 for polytomous responses, and the
		polytomous G-DINA model by Chen and de la Torre
		DOI:10.1177/0146621613479818 for polytomous attributes. Joint
		attribute distribution can be independent, saturated, higher-
		order, loglinear smoothed or structured. Q-matrix validation,
		item and model fit statistics, model comparison at test and
		item level and differential item functioning can also be
		conducted. A graphical user interface is also provided.
