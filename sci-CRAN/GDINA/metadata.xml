		The Generalized DINA Model Framework // A set of psychometric
		tools for cognitive diagnosis modeling for both dichotomous and
		polytomous responses. Various cognitive diagnosis models can be
		estimated, include the generalized deterministic inputs, noisy
		and gate (G-DINA) model by de la Torre (2011)
		DOI:10.1007/s11336-011-9207-7, the sequential G-DINA model by
		Ma and de la Torre (2016) DOI:10.1111/bmsp.12070, and many
		other models they subsume. Joint attribute distribution can be
		independent, saturated, higher-order, loglinear smoothed or
		structured. Q-matrix validation, item and model fit statistics,
		model comparison at test and item level and differential item
		functioning can also be conducted. A graphical user interface
		is also provided.
