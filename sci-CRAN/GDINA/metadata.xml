		The Generalized DINA Model Framework // A set of psychometric
		tools for cognitive diagnostic analyses for both dichotomous
		and polytomous responses. Various cognitive diagnosis models
		can be estimated, include the generalized deterministic inputs,
		noisy and gate (G-DINA) model by de la Torre (2011)
		DOI:10.1007/s11336-011-9207-7, the sequential G-DINA model by
		Ma and de la Torre (2016) DOI:10.1111/bmsp.12070, and many
		other models they subsume. Joint attribute distribution can be
		saturated, higher-order or structured. Q-matrix validation,
		item and model fit statistics, model comparison at test and
		item level and differential item functioning can also be
		conducted. A graphical user interface is also provided.
