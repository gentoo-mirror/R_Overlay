		Elementary Probability on Finite Sample Spaces // Performs
		elementary probability calculations on finite sample spaces,
		which may be represented by data frames  or lists. This package
		is meant to rescue some widely used functions from the archived
		'prob' package (see
		https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/prob/).
		Functionality includes setting up sample spaces, counting
		tools, defining probability spaces, performing set algebra,
		calculating probability and conditional probability, tools for
		simulation and checking the law of  large numbers, adding
		random variables, and finding marginal distributions.
		Characteristic functions for all base R distributions are
		included.
