		Adherence to Medications // Computation of adherence to
		medications from Electronic Health care Data and visualization
		of individual medication histories and adherence patterns. The
		package implements a set of S3 classes and functions consistent
		with current adherence guidelines and definitions. It allows
		the computation of different measures of adherence (as defined
		in the literature, but also several original ones), their
		publication-quality plotting, the interactive exploration of
		patient medication history and the real-time estimation of
		adherence given various parameter settings.
