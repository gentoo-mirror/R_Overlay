		Adherence to Medications // Computation of adherence to
		medications from Electronic Health care Data and visualization
		of individual medication histories and adherence patterns. The
		package implements a set of S3 classes and functions consistent
		with current adherence guidelines and definitions. It allows
		the computation of different measures of adherence (as defined
		in the literature, but also several original ones), their
		publication-quality plotting, the estimation of event duration
		and time to initiation, the interactive exploration of patient
		medication history and the real-time estimation of adherence
		given various parameter settings. It scales from very small
		datasets stored in flat CSV files to very large databases and
		from single-thread processing on mid-range consumer laptops to
		parallel processing on large heterogeneous computing clusters.
		It exposes a standardized interface allowing it to be used from
		other programming languages and platforms, such as Python.
