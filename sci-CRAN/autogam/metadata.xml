		Automate the Creation of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) //
		This wrapper package for 'mgcv' makes it easier to create high-
		performing Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). With its central
		function autogam(), by entering just a dataset and the name of
		the outcome column as inputs, 'AutoGAM' tries to automate the
		procedure of configuring a highly accurate GAM which performs
		at reasonably high speed, even for large datasets.
