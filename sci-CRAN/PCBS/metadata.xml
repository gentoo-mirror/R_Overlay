		Principal Component BiSulfite // A system for fast, accurate, and
		flexible whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data analysis
		of two-condition comparisons. Principal Component BiSulfite,
		'PCBS', assigns methylated loci eigenvector values from the
		treatment-delineating principal component in lieu of running
		millions of pairwise statistical tests, which dramatically
		increases analysis flexibility and reduces computational
		requirements. Methods: https://katlande.github.io/PCBS/articles
		/Differential_Methylation.html.
