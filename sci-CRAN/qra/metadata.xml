		Quantal Response Analysis for Dose-Mortality Data // Functions
		are provided that implement the use of the Fieller's formula
		methodology, for calculating a confidence interval for a ratio
		of (possibly, correlated) means.  See Fieller (1954)
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1954.tb00159.x.  Here, the application
		of primary interest is to studies ofinsect mortality response
		toincreasing doses of a fumigant, or, e.g., to time in
		coolstorage. The formula is used to calculate a confidence
		interval for the dose or time required to achieve a specified
		mortality proportion, commonly 0.5 or 0.99.  A vignette
		demonstrates link functions that may be considered, and
		alternative choices of error family.  Note in particular the
		beta-binomial error family.  See also Maindonald, Waddell, and
		Petry (2001) doi:10.1016/S0925-5214(01)00082-5.
