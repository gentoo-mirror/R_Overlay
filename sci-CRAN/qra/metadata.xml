		Quantal Response Analysis for Dose-Mortality Data // Functions
		are provided that implement the use of the Fieller's formula
		methodology, for calculating a confidence interval for a ratio
		of (commonly, correlated) means.  See Fieller (1954)
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1954.tb00159.x.  Here, the application
		of primary interest is to studies ofinsect mortality response
		toincreasing doses of a fumigant, or, e.g., to time in
		coolstorage. The formula is used to calculate a confidence
		interval for the dose or time required to achieve a specified
		mortality proportion, commonly 0.5 or 0.99.  Vignettes
		demonstrate link functions that may be considered, checks on
		fitted models, and alternative choices of error family.  Note
		in particular the betabinomial error family. See also
