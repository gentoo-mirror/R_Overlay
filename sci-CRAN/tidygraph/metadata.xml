		A Tidy API for Graph Manipulation // A graph, while not "tidy" in
		itself, can be thought of as two tidy data frames describing
		node and edge data respectively. 'tidygraph' provides an
		approach to manipulate these two virtual data frames using the
		API defined in the 'dplyr' package, as well as provides tidy
		interfaces to a lot of common graph algorithms.
