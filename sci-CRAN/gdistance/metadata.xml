		Distances and Routes on Geographical Grids // Provides classes
		and functions to calculate various distance measures and routes
		in heterogeneous geographic spaces represented as grids. The
		package implements measures to model dispersal histories first
		presented by van Etten and Hijmans (2010)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012060. Least-cost distances as well
		as more complex distances based on (constrained) random walks
		can be calculated. The distances implemented in the package are
		used in geographical genetics, accessibility indicators, and
		may also have applications in other fields of geospatial
		analysis.
