		The Pareto, Piecewise Pareto and Generalized Pareto Distribution
		// Utilities for the Pareto, piecewise Pareto and generalized
		Pareto distribution that are useful for reinsurance pricing. In
		particular, the package provides a non-trivial algorithm that
		can be used to match the expected losses of a tower of
		reinsurance layers with a layer-independent collective risk
		model. The theoretical background of the matching algorithm and
		most other methods are described in Ulrich Riegel (2018)
