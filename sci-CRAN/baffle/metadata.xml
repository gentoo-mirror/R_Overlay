		Make Waffle Plots with Base Graphics // Waffle plots are
		rectangular pie charts that represent a quantity or abundances
		using colored squares or other symbol. This makes them better
		at transmitting information as the discrete number of squares
		is easier to read than the circular area of pie charts. While
		the original waffle charts were rectangular with 10 rows and
		columns, with a single square representing 1%, they are
		nowadays popular in various infographics to visualize any
		proportional ratios.
