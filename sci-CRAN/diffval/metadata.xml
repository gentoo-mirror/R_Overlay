		Vegetation Patterns // Find, visualize and explore patterns of
		differential taxa in vegetation data (namely in a
		phytosociological table), using the Differential Value
		(DiffVal). Patterns are searched through mathematical
		optimization algorithms. Ultimately, Total Differential Value
		(TDV) optimization aims at obtaining classifications of
		vegetation data based on differential taxa, as in the
		traditional geobotanical approach. The Gurobi optimizer, as
		well as the R package 'gurobi', can be installed from
		https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/. The useful
		vignette Gurobi Installation Guide, from package 'prioritizr',
		can be found here:
		https://prioritizr.net/articles/gurobi_installation_guide.html.
