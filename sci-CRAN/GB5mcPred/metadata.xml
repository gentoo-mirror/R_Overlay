		Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Predicting Methylation States //
		DNA methylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the result of a
		multi-step, enzyme-dependent process. Predicting these sites
		in-vitro is laborious, time consuming as well as costly. This '
		Gb5mC-Pred ' package is an in-silico pipeline for predicting
		DNA sequences containing the 5mC sites. It uses a machine
		learning approach which uses Stochastic Gradient Boosting
		approach for prediction of the sequences with 5mC sites. This
		package has been developed by using the concept of Navarez and
		Roxas (2022) doi:10.1109/TCBB.2021.3082184.
