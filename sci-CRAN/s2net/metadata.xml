		The Generalized Semi-Supervised Elastic-Net // Implements the
		generalized semi-supervised elastic-net. This method extends
		the supervised elastic-net problem, and thus it is a practical
		solution to the problem of feature selection in semi-supervised
		contexts. Its mathematical formulation is presented from a
		general perspective, covering a wide range of models.  We focus
		on linear and logistic responses, but the implementation could
		be easily extended to other losses in generalized linear
		models. We develop a flexible and fast implementation, written
		in 'C++' using 'RcppArmadillo' and integrated into R via 'Rcpp'
		modules. See Culp, M. 2013 doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.657139 for
		references on the Joint Trained Elastic-Net.
