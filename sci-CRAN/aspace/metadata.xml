		Functions for Estimating Centrographic Statistics // A collection
		of functions for computing centrographic statistics (e.g.,
		standard distance, standard deviation ellipse, standard
		deviation box) for observations taken at point locations.
		Separate plotting functions have been developed for each
		measure. Users interested in writing results to ESRI shapefiles
		can do so by using results from 'aspace' functions as inputs to
		the convert.to.shapefile() and write.shapefile() functions in
		the 'shapefiles' library. We intend to provide 'terra'
		integration for geographic data in a future release. The
		'aspace' package was originally conceived to aid in the
		analysis of spatial patterns of travel behaviour (see Buliung
		and Remmel 2008 doi:10.1007/s10109-008-0063-7).
