		Interactive Self-Organizing Maps // Self-organizing maps (also
		known as SOM, see Kohonen (2001) doi:10.1007/978-3-642-56927-2)
		are a method for dimensionality reduction and clustering of
		continuous data. This package introduces interactive (html)
		graphics for easier analysis of SOM results. It also features
		an interactive interface, for push-button training and
		visualization of SOM, as well as tools to evaluate the quality
		of SOM.
