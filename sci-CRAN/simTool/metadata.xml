		Conduct Simulation Studies with a Minimal Amount of Source Code
		// Tool for statistical simulations that have two components.
		One component generates the data and the other one analyzes the
		data. The main aims of the package are the reduction of the
		administrative source code (mainly loops and management code
		for the results) and a simple applicability of the package that
		allows the user to quickly learn how to work with it. Parallel
		computing is also supported. Finally, convenient functions are
		provided to summarize the simulation results.
