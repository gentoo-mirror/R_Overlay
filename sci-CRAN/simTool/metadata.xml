		Conduct Simulation Studies with a Minimal Amount of Source Code.
		// The simTool package is designed for statistical simulations
		that have two components. One component generates the data and
		the other one analyzes the data. The main aims of the simTool
		package are the reduction of the administrative source code
		(mainly loops and management code for the results) and a simple
		applicability of the package that allows the user to quickly
		learn how to work with the simTool package. Parallel computing
		is also supported. Finally, convenient functions are provided
		to summarize the simulation results.
