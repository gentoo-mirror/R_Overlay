		Intensity Estimation on Geometric Networks with Penalized Splines
		// Fitting the intensity function of point processes on
		geometric networks. The method makes use of generalized
		additive models (GAM). The method is described in Marc
		Schneble, Gran Kauermann. "Intensity estimation on geometric
		networks with penalized splines." The Annals of Applied
		Statistics, 16(2) 843-865 June 2022. doi:10.1214/21-AOAS1522. A
		new class for representing linear networks as geometric
		networks is the core of the package.
