		Intensity Estimation on Geometric Networks with Penalized Splines
		// Fitting the intensity function of point processes on
		geometric networks. The method makes use of generalized
		additive models (GAM). The method is described in Schneble and
		Kauermann (2020) arXiv:2002.10270. A new class for representing
		linear networks as geometric networks is the core of the
		package.
