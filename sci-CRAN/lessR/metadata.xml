		Less Code, More Results // Each function accomplishes the work of
		several or more standard R functions. For example, two function
		calls, Read() and CountAll(), read the data and generate
		summary statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus
		histograms and bar charts as appropriate.  Other functions
		provide for descriptive statistics, a comprehensive regression
		analysis, analysis of variance and t-test, plotting including
		the introduced here Violin/Box/Scatter plot for a numerical
		variable, bar chart, histogram, box plot, density curves,
		calibrated power curve, reading multiple data formats with the
		same function call, variable labels, color themes, Trellis
		graphics and a built-in help system. Also includes a
		confirmatory factor analysis of multiple indicator measurement
		models, pedagogical routines for data simulation such as for
		the Central Limit Theorem, and generation of R markdown
		instructions for interpretative output.
