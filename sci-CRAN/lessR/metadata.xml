		Less Code, More Results // Each function accomplishes the work of
		multiple standard R functions. For example, two function calls,
		Read() and CountAll(), read the data and generate summary
		statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus histograms
		and bar charts as appropriate. Other functions provide for
		comprehensive summary statistics via pivot tables, a
		comprehensive regression analysis, ANOVA and t-test,
		visualizations including the Violin/Box/Scatter plot for a
		numerical variable, bar chart, histogram, box plot, density
		curves, calibrated power curve, reading multiple data formats
		with the same function call, variable labels, color themes, and
		Trellis graphics. Also includes a confirmatory factor analysis
		of multiple indicator measurement models, pedagogical routines
		for data simulation such as for the Central Limit Theorem,
		generation and rendering of regression instructions for
		interpretative output, and interactive visualizations.
