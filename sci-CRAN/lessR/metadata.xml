		Less Code, More Results // Each function accomplishes the work of
		several or more standard R functions. For example, two function
		calls, Read() and CountAll(), read the data and generate
		summary statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus
		histograms and bar charts as appropriate.  Other functions
		provide for descriptive statistics, a comprehensive regression
		analysis, analysis of variance and t-test, plotting, bar chart,
		histogram, box plot, density curves, calibrated power curve,
		reading multiple data formats with the same function call,
		variable labels, color themes, and a built-in help system. A
		confirmatory factor analysis of multiple indicator measurement
		models is available, as are pedagogical routines for data
		simulation such as for the Central Limit Theorem. Compatible
		with 'RStudio' and 'knitr' including generation of 'knitr'
		instructions for interpretative output.
