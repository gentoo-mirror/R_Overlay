		Less Code, More Results // Each function accomplishes the work of
		several or more standard R functions. For example, two function
		calls, Read() and CountAll(), read the data and generate
		summary statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus
		histograms and bar charts as appropriate. Other functions
		provide for descriptive statistics, a comprehensive regression
		analysis, analysis of variance and t-test, visualizations
		including the Violin/Box/Scatter plot for a numerical variable,
		bar chart, histogram, box plot, density curves, calibrated
		power curve, reading multiple data formats with the same
		function call, variable labels, color themes, Trellis graphics,
		and comprehensive summary statistics via pivot tables. Also
		includes a confirmatory factor analysis of multiple indicator
		measurement models, pedagogical routines for data simulation
		such as for the Central Limit Theorem, and generation and
		rendering of R markdown instructions for interpretative output.
