		Modified Poisson and Least-Squares Regressions for Binary Outcome
		// Modified Poisson and least-squares regression analyses for
		binary outcomes of Zou (2004) doi:10.1093/aje/kwh090 and Cheung
		(2007) doi:10.1093/aje/kwm223 have been standard multivariate
		analysis methods to estimate risk ratio and risk difference in
		clinical and epidemiological studies. This R package involves
		an easy-to-handle function to implement these analyses by
		simple commands. Also, recent studies have shown the ordinary
		robust variance estimator possibly has serious bias under small
		or moderate sample size situations for these methods. This
		package also provides computational tools to calculate
		alternative accurate confidence intervals (Noma and Gosho
		(2024) Forthcoming).
