		Comprehensive Tools for Drug Formulation Analysis and
		Visualization // This presents a comprehensive set of tools for
		the analysis and visualization of drug formulation data. It
		includes functions for statistical analysis, regression
		modeling, hypothesis testing, and comparative analysis to
		assess the impact of formulation parameters on drug release and
		other critical attributes. Additionally, the package offers a
		variety of data visualization functions, such as scatterplots,
		histograms, and boxplots, to facilitate the interpretation of
		formulation data. With its focus on usability and efficiency,
		this package aims to streamline the drug formulation process
		and aid researchers in making informed decisions during
		formulation design and optimization.
