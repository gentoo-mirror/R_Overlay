		Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 2 // A simulation modeling framework
		which significantly extends capabilities from the 'MGDrivE'
		simulation package via a new mathematical and computational
		framework based on stochastic Petri nets. For more information
		about 'MGDrivE', see our publication: Snchez et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13318 Some of the notable capabilities of
		'MGDrivE2' include: incorporation of human populations,
		epidemiological dynamics, time-varying parameters, and a
		continuous-time simulation framework with various sampling
		algorithms for both deterministic and stochastic
		interpretations. 'MGDrivE2' relies on the genetic inheritance
		structures provided in package 'MGDrivE', so we suggest
		installing that package initially.
