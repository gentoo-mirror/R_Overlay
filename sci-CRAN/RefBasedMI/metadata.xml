		Reference-Based Imputation for Longitudinal Clinical Trials with
		Protocol Deviation // Imputation of missing numerical outcomes
		for a longitudinal trial with protocol deviations. The package
		uses distinct treatment arm-based assumptions for the
		unobserved data, following the general algorithm of Carpenter,
		Roger, and Kenward (2013) doi:10.1080/10543406.2013.834911, and
		the causal model of White, Royes and Best (2020)
		doi:10.1080/10543406.2019.1684308. Sensitivity analyses to
		departures from these assumptions can be done by the Delta
		method of Roger. The program is derived from the 'mimix'
		'Stata' package written by Suzie Cro, with additional coding
		for the causal model and delta method. The reference-based
		methods are jump to reference (J2R), copy increments in
		reference (CIR), copy reference (CR), and the causal model, all
		of which must specify the reference treatment arm. Other
		methods are missing at random (MAR) and the last mean carried
		forward (LMCF). Individual-specific imputation methods (and
		their reference groups) can be specified.
