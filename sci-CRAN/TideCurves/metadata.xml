		Analysis and Prediction of Tides // Tidal analysis of evenly
		spaced observed time series (time step 1 to 60 min) with or
		without shorter gaps using the harmonic representation of
		inequalities. The analysis should preferably cover an
		observation period of at least 19 years. For shorter periods
		low frequency constituents are not taken into account, in
		accordance with the Rayleigh-Criterion. The main objective of
		this package is to synthesize or predict a tidal time series.
