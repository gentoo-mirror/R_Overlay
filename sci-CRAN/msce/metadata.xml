		Hazard of Multi-Stage Clonal Expansion Models // Functions to
		calculate hazard and survival function of Multi-Stage Clonal
		Expansion Models used in cancer epidemiology. For the Two-Stage
		Clonal Expansion Model an exact solution is implemented
		assuming piecewise constant parameters. Numerical solutions are
		provided for its extensions.
