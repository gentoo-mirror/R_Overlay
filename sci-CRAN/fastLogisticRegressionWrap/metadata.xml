		Fast Logistic Regression Wrapper // Provides very fast logistic
		regression with inferences plus other useful methods such as a
		forward stepwise model generator. It is fundamentally a wrapper
		to the amazing fastLR() method in the 'RcppNumerical' package
		by Yixuan Qiu et al. This package allows their work to be more
		useful to the wider community.
