		Lightweight Well-Known Geometry Parsing // Provides a minimal R
		and C++ API for parsing well-known binary and well-known text
		representation of geometries to and from R-native formats.
		Well-known binary is compact and fast to parse; well-known text
		is human-readable and is useful for writing tests. These
		formats are only useful in R if the information they contain
		can be accessed in R, for which high-performance functions are
		provided here.
