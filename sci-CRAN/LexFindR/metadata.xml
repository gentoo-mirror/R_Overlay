		Find Related Items and Lexical Dimensions in a Lexicon //
		Implements code to identify lexical competitors in a given list
		of words. We include many of the standard competitor types used
		in spoken word recognition research, such as functions to find
		cohorts, neighbors, and rhymes, amongst many others. The
		package includes documentation for using a variety of lexicon
		files, including those with form codes made up of multiple
		letters (i.e., phoneme codes) and also basic orthographies.
		Importantly, the code makes use of multiple CPU cores and
		vectorization when possible, making it extremely fast and able
		to handle large lexicons. Additionally, the package contains
		documentation for users to easily write new functions, allowing
		researchers to examine other relationships within a lexicon.
