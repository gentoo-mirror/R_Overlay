		Non Metric Space (Approximate) Library // A Non-Metric Space
		Library ('NMSLIB' https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) wrapper,
		which according to the authors "is an efficient cross-platform
		similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of
		similarity search methods. The goal of the 'NMSLIB'
		https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib Library is to create an
		effective and comprehensive toolkit for searching in generic
		non-metric spaces. Being comprehensive is important, because no
		single method is likely to be sufficient in all cases. Also
		note that exact solutions are hardly efficient in high
		dimensions and/or non-metric spaces. Hence, the main focus is
		on approximate methods". The wrapper also includes Approximate
		Kernel k-Nearest-Neighbor functions based on the 'NMSLIB'
		https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib 'Python' Library.
