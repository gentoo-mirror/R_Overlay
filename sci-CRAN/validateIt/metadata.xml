		Validating Topic Coherence and Topic Labels // By creating crowd-
		sourcing tasks that can be easily posted and results retrieved
		using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) API, researchers can use
		this solution to validate the quality of topics obtained from
		unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods, and the
		relevance of topic labels assigned. This helps ensure that the
		topic modeling results are accurate and useful for research
		purposes. See Ying and others (2022)
