		Simulation-Based Sensitivity Analysis for Causal Mediation
		Studies // Simulation-based sensitivity analysis for causal
		mediation studies. It numerically and graphically evaluates the
		sensitivity of causal mediation analysis results to the
		presence of unmeasured pretreatment confounding. The proposed
		method has primary advantages over existing methods. First,
		using an unmeasured pretreatment confounder conditional
		associations with the treatment, mediator, and outcome as
		sensitivity parameters, the method enables users to intuitively
		assess sensitivity in reference to prior knowledge about the
		strength of a potential unmeasured pretreatment confounder.
		Second, the method accurately reflects the influence of
		unmeasured pretreatment confounding on the efficiency of
		estimation of the causal effects. Third, the method can be
		implemented in different causal mediation analysis approaches,
		including regression-based, simulation-based, and propensity
		score-based methods. It is applicable to both randomized
		experiments and observational studies.
