		Bayesian Post-Estimation on the Mean Scale // Computes Bayesian
		posterior distributions of predictions, marginal effects, and
		differences of marginal effects for various generalized linear
		models. Importantly, the posteriors are on the mean (response)
		scale, allowing for more natural interpretation than summaries
		on the link scale. Also, predictions and marginal effects of
		the count probabilities for Poisson and negative binomial
		models can be computed.
