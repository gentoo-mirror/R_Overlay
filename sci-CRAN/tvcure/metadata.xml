		Additive Cure Survival Model with Time-Varying Covariates // Fit
		of a double additive cure survival model with time-varying
		covariates. The additive terms in the long- and short-term
		survival submodels, modelling the cure probability and the
		event timing for susceptible units, are estimated using Laplace
		P-splines. For more details, see Lambert and Kreyenfeld (2025)
