		Bayes Nets: 'RHugin' Emulation with 'gRain' // Wrappers for
		functions in the 'gRain' package to emulate some 'RHugin'
		functionality, allowing the building of Bayesian networks
		consisting on discrete chance nodes incrementally, through
		adding nodes, edges and conditional probability tables, the
		setting of evidence,   both 'hard' (boolean) or 'soft'
		(likelihoods), querying marginal probabilities   and
		normalizing constants, and generating sets of high-probability
		configurations. Computations will typically not be so fast as
		they are with 'RHugin', but this package should assist users
		without access to 'Hugin' to use code written to use 'RHugin'.
