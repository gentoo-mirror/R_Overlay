		Bayes Nets: 'RHugin' Emulation with 'gRain' // Wrappers for
		functions in the 'gRain' package to emulate some 'RHugin'
		functionality, allowing the building of Bayesian networks
		incrementally, through adding nodes, edges and conditional
		probability tables, the setting of evidence, both 'hard'
		(boolean) or 'soft' (likelihoods), and querying marginal
		probabilities and normalizing constants. Computations will
		typically not be so fast as they are with 'RHugin', but this
		package should assist users without access to 'Hugin' to use
		code written to use 'RHugin'.
