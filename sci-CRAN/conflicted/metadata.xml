		An Alternative Conflict Resolution Strategy // R's default
		conflict management system gives the most recently loaded
		package precedence. This can make it hard to detect conflicts,
		particularly when they arise because a package update creates
		ambiguity that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes a
		different approach, making every conflict an error and forcing
		you to choose which function to use.
