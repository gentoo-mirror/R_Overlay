		Calculate Distance to Features // Calculates distances from point
		locations to features. The usual approach for eg. resource
		selection function analyses is to generate a complete distance
		to features surface then sample it with your observed and
		random points. Since these raster based approaches can be
		pretty costly with large areas, and often lead to memory issues
		in R, the distanceto package opts to compute these distances
		using efficient, vector based approaches. As a helper, there's
		a decidedly low-res raster based approach for visually
		inspecting your region's distance surface. But the workhorse is
		distance_to.
