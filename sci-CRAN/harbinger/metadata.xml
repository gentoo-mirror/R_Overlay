		A Unified Time Series Event Detection Framework // By analyzing
		time series, it is possible to observe significant changes in
		the behavior of observations that frequently characterize
		events. Events present themselves as anomalies, change points,
		or motifs. In the literature, there are several methods for
		detecting events. However, searching for a suitable time series
		method is a complex task, especially considering that the
		nature of events is often unknown. This work presents
		Harbinger, a framework for integrating and analyzing event
		detection methods. Harbinger contains several state-of-the-art
		methods described in Salles et al. (2020)
