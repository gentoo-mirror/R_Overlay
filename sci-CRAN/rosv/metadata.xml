		Client to Access and Operate on the 'Open Source Vulnerability'
		API // Connect, query, and operate on information available
		from the 'Open Source Vulnerability' database https://osv.dev/.
		Although 'CRAN' has vulnerabilities listed, these are few
		compared to projects such as 'PyPI'. With tighter integration
		between 'R' and 'Python', having an 'R' specific package to
		access details about vulnerabilities from various sources is a
		worthwhile enterprise.
