		(Precipitation) Frequency Analysis and Variability with L-Moments
		from 'lmom' // It is an extension of 'lmom' R package:
		'pel...()','cdf...()',qua...()' function families are lumped
		and called from one function per each family respectively in
		order to create robust automatic tools to fit data  with
		different probability distributions and then to estimate
		probability values and return periods.  The implemented
		functions are able to manage time series with constant and/or
		missing values without stopping the execution with error
		messages. The package also contains tools to  calculate several
		indices based on variability (e.g. 'SPI' , Standardized
		Precipitation Index, see
		https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-
		precipitation-index-spi and http://spei.csic.es/) for multiple
		time series or spatially gridded values.
