		Matrix Exponential using Krylov Subspace Routines // Implements
		functions from 'EXPOKIT' (https://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/)
		to calculate matrix exponentials, Sidje RB, (1998)
		doi:10.1145/285861.285868. Includes functions for small dense
		matrices along with functions for large sparse matrices. The
		functions for large sparse matrices implement Krylov subspace
		methods which help minimise the computational complexity for
		matrix exponentials. 'Kexpmv' can be utilised to calculate both
		the matrix exponential in isolation along with the product of
		the matrix exponential and a vector.
