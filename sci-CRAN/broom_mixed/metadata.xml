		Tidying Methods for Mixed Models // Convert fitted objects from
		various R mixed-model packages into tidy data frames along the
		lines of the 'broom' package. The package provides three S3
		generics for each model: tidy(), which summarizes a model's
		statistical findings such as coefficients of a regression;
		augment(), which adds columns to the original data such as
		predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance(),
		which provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
