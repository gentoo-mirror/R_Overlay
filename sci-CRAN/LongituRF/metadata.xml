		Random Forests for Longitudinal Data // Random forests are a
		statistical learning method widely used in many areas of
		scientific research essentially for its ability to learn
		complex relationships between input and output variables and
		also its capacity to handle high-dimensional data. However,
		current random forests approaches are not flexible enough to
		handle longitudinal data.  In this package, we propose a
		general approach of random forests for high-dimensional
		longitudinal data. It includes a flexible stochastic model
		which allows the covariance structure to vary over time.
		Furthermore, we introduce a new method which takes intra-
		individual covariance into consideration to build random
		forests. The method is fully detailled in Capitaine et.al.
