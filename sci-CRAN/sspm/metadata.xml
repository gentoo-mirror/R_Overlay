		Spatial Surplus Production Model Framework for Northern Shrimp
		Populations // Implement a gam-based spatial surplus production
		model, aimed at modeling northern shrimp population in Atlantic
		Canada but potentially to any stock in any location. The
		package is opinionated in its implementation of SPMs as it
		internally makes the choice to use penalized spatial gams with
		time lags. However, it also aims to provide options for the
		user to customize their model.
