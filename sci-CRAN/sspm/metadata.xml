		Spatial Surplus Production Model Framework for Northern Shrimp
		Populations // Implement a GAM-based (Generalized Additive
		Models) spatial surplus production model (spatial SPM), aimed
		at modeling northern shrimp population in Atlantic Canada but
		potentially to any stock in any location. The package is
		opinionated in its implementation of SPMs as it internally
		makes the choice to use penalized spatial gams with time lags.
		However, it also aims to provide options for the user to
		customize their model. The methods are described in Pedersen et
		al. (2022, https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-
		sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2022/2022_062-eng.html).
