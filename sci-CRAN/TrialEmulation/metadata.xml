		Causal Analysis of Observational Time-to-Event Data // Implements
		target trial emulation methods to apply randomized clinical
		trial design and analysis in an observational setting. Using
		marginal structural models, it can estimate intention-to-treat
		and per-protocol effects in emulated trials using electronic
		health records. A description and application of the method can
		be found in Danaei et al (2013) doi:10.1177/0962280211403603.
