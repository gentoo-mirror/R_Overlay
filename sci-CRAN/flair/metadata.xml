		Highlight, Annotate, and Format your R Source Code // Facilitates
		easier formatting and highlighting of R source code in a R
		Markdown-based presentation. The main goal of the package is to
		allow users to preserve their code creation process within code
		chunks, then to specify formatting details for the source code,
		such as highlighting of particular syntactical elements.
