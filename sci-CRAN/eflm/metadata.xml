		Efficient Fitting of Linear and Generalized Linear Models //
		Efficient Fitting of Linear and Generalized Linear Models by
		using just base R. As an alternative to lm() and glm(), this
		package provides elm() and eglm(), with a significant speedup
		when the number of observations is larger than the number of
		parameters to estimate. The speed gains are obtained by
		reducing the NxP model matrix to a PxP matrix, and the best
		computational performance is obtained when R is linked against
		'OpenBLAS', 'Intel MKL' or other optimized 'BLAS' library. This
		implementation aims at being compatible with 'broom' and
		'sandwich' packages for summary statistics and clustering by
		providing S3 methods.
