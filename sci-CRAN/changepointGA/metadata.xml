		Changepoint Detection via Modified Genetic Algorithm // The
		Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to perform changepoint analysis
		in time series data. The package also includes an extended
		island version of GA, as described in Lu, Lund, and Lee (2010,
		doi:10.1214/09-AOAS289). By mimicking the principles of natural
		selection and evolution, GA provides a powerful stochastic
		search technique for solving combinatorial optimization
		problems. In 'changepointGA', each chromosome represents a
		changepoint configuration, including the number and locations
		of changepoints, hyperparameters, and model parameters. The
		package employs genetic operatorsselection, crossover, and
		mutationto iteratively improve solutions based on the given
		fitness (objective) function. Key features of 'changepointGA'
		include encoding changepoint configurations in an integer
		format, enabling dynamic and simultaneous estimation of model
		hyperparameters, changepoint configurations, and associated
		parameters. The detailed algorithmic implementation can be
		found in the package vignettes and in the paper of Li (2024,
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2410.15571).
