		Nonparametric Regression and Bandwidth Selection for Spatial
		Models // Nonparametric smoothing techniques for data on a
		lattice and functional time series. Smoothing is done via
		kernel regression or local polynomial regression, a bandwidth
		selection procedure based on an iterative plug-in algorithm is
		implemented. This package allows for modeling a dependency
		structure of the error terms of the nonparametric regression
		model.  Methods used in this paper are described in
