		The BETS Model for Early Epidemic Data // Implements likelihood
		inference for early epidemic analysis. BETS is short for the
		four key epidemiological events being modeled: Begin of
		exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of
		Symptom onset. The package contains a dataset of the trajectory
		of confirmed cases during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
		early outbreak. More detail of the statistical methods can be
		found in Zhao et al. (2020) arXiv:2004.07743.
