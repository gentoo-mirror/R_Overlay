		Modified Poisson Regression of Grouped and Right-Censored Counts
		// Implement maximum likelihood estimation for Poisson
		generalized linear models with grouped and right-censored count
		data. Intended to be used for analyzing grouped and right-
		censored data, which is widely applied in many branches of
		social sciences. The algorithm implemented is described in Fu
		et al., (2021) doi:10.1111/rssa.12678.
