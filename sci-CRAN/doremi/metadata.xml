		Dynamics of Return to Equilibrium During Multiple Inputs //
		Provides models to fit the dynamics of a regulated system
		experiencing exogenous inputs. The underlying models use
		differential equations and linear mixed-effects regressions to
		estimate the characteristic parameters of the equation (the
		coefficients) and an estimated signal. The package also
		provides print, summary, plot and predict functions, specific
		for the models outputs.
