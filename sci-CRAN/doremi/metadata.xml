		Dynamics of Return to Equilibrium During Multiple Inputs //
		Provides models to fit the dynamics of a regulated system
		experiencing exogenous inputs. The underlying models use
		differential equations and linear mixed-effects regressions to
		estimate the coefficients of the equation. With them, the
		functions can provide an estimated signal. The package provides
		simulation and analysis functions and also print, summary, plot
		and predict methods, adapted to the function outputs, for easy
		implementation and presentation of results.
