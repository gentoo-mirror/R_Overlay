		Prevalence Adjusted PPV Confidence Interval // Positive
		predictive value (PPV) defined as the conditional probability
		of clinical trial assay (CTA) being positive given Companion
		diagnostic device (CDx) being positive is a key performance
		parameter for evaluating the clinical validity utility of a
		companion diagnostic test in clinical bridging studies. When
		bridging study patients are enrolled based on CTA assay
		results, Binomial-based confidence intervals (CI) may are not
		appropriate for PPV CI estimation. Bootstrap CIs which are not
		restricted by the Binomial assumption may be used for PPV CI
		estimation only when PPV is not 100%. Bootstrap CI is not valid
		when PPV is 100% and becomes a single value of [1, 1]. We
		proposed a risk ratio-based method for constructing CI for PPV.
		By simulation we illustrated that the coverage probability of
		the proposed CI is close to the nominal value even when PPV is
		high and negative percent agreement (NPA) is close to 100%.
		There is a lack of R package for PPV CI calculation. we
		developed a publicly available R package along with this shiny
		app to implement the proposed approach and some other existing
		methods.
