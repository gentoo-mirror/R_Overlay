		Plots for Circular Data // Provides functions to produce some
		circular plots for circular data, in a height- or area-
		proportional manner. They include barplots, smooth density
		plots, stacked dot plots, histograms, multi-class stacked
		smooth density plots, and multi-class stacked histograms. The
		new methodology for general area-proportional circular
		visualization is described in an article submitted (after
		revision) to Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.
