		Bayesian Inference for Multivariate Stochastic Differential
		Equations // Implements an MCMC sampler for the posterior
		distribution of arbitrary time-homogeneous multivariate
		stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with possibly
		latent components.  The package provides a simple entry point
		to integrate user-defined models directly with the sampler's
		C++ code, and parallelizes large portions of the calculations
		when compiled with 'OpenMP'.
