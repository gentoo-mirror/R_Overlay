		Furniture for Quantitative Scientists // Contains two main
		functions (i.e., two pieces of furniture): table1() which
		produces a well-formatted table of descriptives common as Table
		1 in research articles and washer() which is helpful in
		cleaning up the data. In addition, long() and wide(), built on
		the stats::reshape(), can help reformat the data. These
		furniture functions are designed to simplify common tasks in
		quantitative analysis. Other data summary and cleaning tools
		are also available.
