		Furniture for Quantitative Scientists // Contains three main
		functions (i.e., three pieces of furniture): table1() which
		produces a well-formatted table of descriptives common as Table
		1 in research articles, tableC() which produces a well-
		formatted table of correlations, tableF() which provides
		frequency counts, and washer() which is helpful in cleaning up
		the data. In addition, long() and wide(), built on the
		stats::reshape(), can help reformat the data. These furniture-
		themed functions are designed to simplify common tasks in
		quantitative analysis. Other data summary and cleaning tools
		are also available.
