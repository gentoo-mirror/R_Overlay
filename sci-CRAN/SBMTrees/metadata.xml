		Sequential Imputation with Bayesian Trees Mixed-Effects Models
		for Longitudinal Data // Implements a sequential imputation
		framework using Bayesian Mixed-Effects Trees ('SBMTrees') for
		handling missing data in longitudinal studies. The package
		supports a variety of models, including non-linear
		relationships and non-normal random effects and residuals,
		leveraging Dirichlet Process priors for increased flexibility.
		Key features include handling Missing at Random (MAR)
		longitudinal data, imputation of both covariates and outcomes,
		and generating posterior predictive samples for further
		analysis. The methodology is designed for applications in
		epidemiology, biostatistics, and other fields requiring robust
		handling of missing data in longitudinal settings.
