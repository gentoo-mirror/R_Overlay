		Tools for Clinical Research // Every research team have their own
		script for data management, statistics and most importantly
		hemodynamic indices. The purpose is to standardize scripts
		utilized in clinical research. The hemodynamic indices can be
		used in a long-format dataframe, and add both periods of
		interest (trigger-periods), and delete artifacts with deleter-
		files. Transfer function analysis (Claassen et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1177/0271678X15626425) and Mx (Czosnyka et al. (1996)
		doi:10.1161/01.str.27.10.1829) can be calculated using this
		package.
