		A Mixed-Effects Model for Analyzing Cluster-Level Non-Ignorable
		Missing Data // Contains functions for estimating a mixed-
		effects model for clustered data (or batch-processed data) with
		cluster-level (or batch- level) missing values in the outcome,
		i.e., the outcomes of some clusters are either all observed or
		missing altogether. The model is developed for analyzing
		incomplete data from labeling-based quantitative proteomics
		experiments but is not limited to this type of data. We used an
		expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm for model
		estimation. The cluster-level missingness may depend on the
		average value of the outcome in the cluster (missing not at
		random).
