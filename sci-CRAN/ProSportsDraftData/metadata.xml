		Professional Sports Draft Data // We provide comprehensive draft
		data for major professional sports leagues, including the
		National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association
		(NBA), and National Hockey League (NHL). It offers access to
		both historical and current draft data, allowing for detailed
		analysis and research on player biases and player performance.
		The package is useful for sports fans and researchers
		interested in identifying biases and trends within scouting
		reports. Created by web scraping data from leading websites
		that cover professional sports player scouting reports, the
		package allows users to filter and summarize data for
		analytical purposes. For further details on the methods used,
		please refer to Wickham (2022) "rvest: Easily Harvest (Scrape)
		Web Pages" https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rvest and
		Harrison (2023) "RSelenium: R Bindings for Selenium WebDriver"
