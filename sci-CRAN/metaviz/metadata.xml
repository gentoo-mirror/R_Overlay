		Forest Plots, Funnel Plots, and Visual Funnel Plot Inference for
		Meta-Analysis // A compilation of functions to plot meta-
		analytic data using 'ggplot2'. Currently allows to create
		forest plots, funnel plots, and many of their variants, such as
		rainforest plots and additional evidence contour enhanced
		funnel plots. In addition, functionalities for visual funnel
		plot inference are provided. In the near future, the 'metaviz'
		package will be extended by further, established as well as
		novel, plotting options for visualizing meta-analytic data.
