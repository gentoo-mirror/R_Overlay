		Robust Tests for Differential Dispersion and Differential
		Expression in RNA-Sequencing Data // Implements the algorithm
		described in Jun Li and Alicia T. Lamere, "DiPhiSeq: Robust
		comparison of expression levels on RNA-Seq data with large
		sample sizes"  (Unpublished). Detects not only genes that show
		different average expressions ("differential expression", DE),
		but also genes that show different diversities of expressions
		in different groups ("differentially dispersed", DD). DD genes
		can be important clinical markers. 'DiPhiSeq' uses a
		redescending penalty on the quasi-likelihood function, and thus
		has superior robustness against outliers and other noise.
		Updates from version 0.1.0: (1) Added the option of using
		adaptive initial value for phi. (2) Added a function for
		estimating the proportion of outliers in the data. (3) Modified
		the input parameter names for clarity, and modified the output
		format for the main function.
