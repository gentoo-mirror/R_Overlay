		RNA-Seq Profile Classifier // We developed a lightweight machine
		learning tool for RNA profiling of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
		(ALL), however, it can be used for any problem where multiple
		classes need to be identified from multi-dimensional data. The
		methodology is described in Makinen V-P, Rehn J, Breen J, Yeung
		D, White DL (2022) Multi-cohort transcriptomic subtyping of
		B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, International Journal of
		Molecular Sciences 23:4574, doi:10.3390/ijms23094574. The
		classifier contains optimized mean profiles of the classes
		(centroids) as observed in the training data, and new samples
		are matched to these centroids using the shortest Euclidean
		distance. Centroids derived from a dataset of 1,598 ALL
		patients are included, but users can train the models with
		their own data as well. The output includes both numerical and
		visual presentations of the classification results. Samples
		with mixed features from multiple classes or atypical values
		are also identified.
