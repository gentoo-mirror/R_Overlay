		RNA-Seq Profile Classifier // We developed a lightweight machine
		learning tool for RNA profiling of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
		(ALL), however, it can be used for any problem where multiple
		classes need to be identified from multi-dimensional data. The
		methodology is described in Makinen V-P, Rehn J, Breen J, Yeung
		D, White DL (2022) Multi-cohort transcriptomic subtyping of
		B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, medRxiv,
		doi:10.1101/2022.02.17.22270919. The classifier contains
		optimized mean profiles of the classes (centroids) as observed
		in the training data, and new samples are matched to these
		centroids using the shortest Euclidean distance. Centroids
		derived from a dataset of 1,598 ALL patients are included, but
		users can train the models with their own data as well. The
		output includes both numerical and visual presentations of the
		classification results. Samples with mixed features from
		multiple classes or atypical values are also identified.
