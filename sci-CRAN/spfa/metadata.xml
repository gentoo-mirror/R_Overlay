		Semi-Parametric Factor Analysis // Estimation, scoring, and
		plotting functions for the semi-parametric factor model
		proposed by Liu  Wang (2022) doi:10.1007/s11336-021-09832-8 and
		Liu  Wang (2023) arXiv:2303.10079. Both the conditional
		densities of observed responses given the latent factors and
		the joint density of latent factors are estimated non-
		parametrically. Functional parameters are approximated by
		smoothing splines, whose coefficients are estimated by
		penalized maximum likelihood using an expectation-maximization
		(EM) algorithm. E- and M-steps can be parallelized on multi-
		thread computing platforms that support 'OpenMP'. Both
		continuous and unordered categorical response variables are
		supported.
