		Smooth Additive Quantile Regression Models // Smooth additive
		quantile regression models, fitted using the methods of Fasiolo
		et al. (2017) arXiv:1707.03307. Differently from 'quantreg',
		the smoothing parameters are estimated automatically by
		marginal loss minimization, while the regression coefficients
		are estimated using either PIRLS or Newton algorithm. The
		learning rate is determined so that the Bayesian credible
		intervals of the estimated effects have approximately the
		correct coverage. The main function is qgam() which is similar
		to gam() in 'mgcv', but fits non-parametric quantile regression
		models.
