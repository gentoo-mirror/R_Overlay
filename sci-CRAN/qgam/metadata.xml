		Smooth Additive Quantile Regression Models // Smooth additive
		quantile regression models, fitted using the methods of Fasiolo
		et al. (2020) doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1725521. See Fasiolo at
		al. (2021) doi:10.18637/jss.v100.i09 for an introduction to the
		package. Differently from 'quantreg', the smoothing parameters
		are estimated automatically by marginal loss minimization,
		while the regression coefficients are estimated using either
		PIRLS or Newton algorithm. The learning rate is determined so
		that the Bayesian credible intervals of the estimated effects
		have approximately the correct coverage. The main function is
		qgam() which is similar to gam() in 'mgcv', but fits non-
		parametric quantile regression models.
