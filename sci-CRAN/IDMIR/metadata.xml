		Identification of Dysregulated MiRNAs Based on MiRNA-MiRNA
		Interaction Network // A systematic biology tool was developed
		to identify dysregulated miRNAs via a miRNA-miRNA interaction
		network. 'IDMIR' first constructed a weighted miRNA interaction
		network through integrating miRNA-target interaction
		information, molecular function data from Gene Ontology (GO)
		database and gene transcriptomic data in specific-disease
		context, and then, it used a network propagation algorithm on
		the network to identify significantly dysregulated miRNAs.
