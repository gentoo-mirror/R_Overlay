		Solving Imbalanced Regression Tasks // Imbalanced domain learning
		has almost exclusively focused on solving classification tasks,
		where the objective is to predict cases labelled with a rare
		class accurately. Such a well-defined approach for regression
		tasks lacked due to two main factors. First, standard
		regression tasks assume that each value is equally important to
		the user. Second, standard evaluation metrics focus on
		assessing the performance of the model on the most common
		cases. This package contains methods to tackle imbalanced
		domain learning problems in regression tasks, where the
		objective is to predict extreme (rare) values. The methods
		contained in this package are: 1) an automatic and non-
		parametric method to obtain such relevance functions; 2)
		visualisation tools; 3) suite of evaluation measures for
		optimisation/validation processes; 4) the squared-error
		relevance area measure, an evaluation metric tailored for
		imbalanced regression tasks. More information can be found in
		Ribeiro and Moniz (2020) doi:10.1007/s10994-020-05900-9.
