		Markov Model for the Online Multi-Channel Attribution Problem //
		Advertisers use a variety of online marketing channels to reach
		consumers and they want to know the degree each channel
		contributes to their marketing success. This is called the
		online multi-channel attribution problem. This package contains
		a probabilistic algorithm for the attribution problem. The
		model uses a k-order Markov representation to identify
		structural correlations in the customer journey data. The
		package also contains three heuristic algorithms (first-touch,
		last-touch and linear-touch approach) for the same problem. The
		algorithms are implemented in C++.
