		Machine Learning Algorithms with Unified Interface and Confusion
		Matrices // A unified interface is provided to various machine
		learning algorithms like LDA, QDA, k-nearest neighbour, LVQ,
		random forest, SVM, ... It allows to train, test, and apply
		cross-validation using similar functions and function arguments
		with a minimalist and clean, formula-based interface. Missing
		data are threated the same way as base and stats R functions
		for all algorithms, both in training and testing. Confusion
		matrices are also provided with a rich set of metrics
		calculated and a few specific plots.
