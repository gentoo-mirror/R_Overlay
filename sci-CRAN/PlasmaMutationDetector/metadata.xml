		Tumor Mutation Detection in Plasma // Aims at detecting single
		nucleotide variation (SNV) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) in
		circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), used as a surrogate marker for
		tumor, at each base position of an Next Generation Sequencing
		(NGS) analysis. Mutations are assessed by comparing the minor-
		allele frequency at each position to the measured PER in
		control samples.
