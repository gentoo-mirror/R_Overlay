		Robust Mixture Discriminant Analysis // Robust mixture
		discriminant analysis (RMDA, Bouveyron  Girard, 2009) allows to
		build a robust supervised classifier from learning data with
		label noise. The idea of the proposed method is to confront an
		unsupervised modeling of the data with the supervised
		information carried by the labels of the learning data in order
		to detect inconsistencies. The method is able afterward to
		build a robust classifier taking into account the detected
		inconsistencies into the labels.
