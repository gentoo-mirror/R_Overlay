		Robust Mixture Discriminant Analysis // Robust mixture
		discriminant analysis (RMDA), proposed in Bouveyron  Girard,
		2009 doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2009.03.027, allows to build a robust
		supervised classifier from learning data with label noise. The
		idea of the proposed method is to confront an unsupervised
		modeling of the data with the supervised information carried by
		the labels of the learning data in order to detect
		inconsistencies. The method is able afterward to build a robust
		classifier taking into account the detected inconsistencies
		into the labels.
