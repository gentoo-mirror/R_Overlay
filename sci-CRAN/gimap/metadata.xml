		Calculate Genetic Interactions for Paired CRISPR Targets // Helps
		find meaningful patterns in complex genetic experiments. First
		gimap takes data from paired CRISPR (Clustered regularly
		interspaced short palindromic repeats) screens that has been
		pre-processed to counts table of paired gRNA (guide Ribonucleic
		Acid) reads. The input data will have cell counts for how well
		cells grow (or don't grow) when different genes or pairs of
		genes are disabled. The output of the 'gimap' package is
		genetic interaction scores which are  the distance between the
		observed CRISPR score and the expected CRISPR score. The
		expected CRISPR scores are what we expect for the CRISPR values
		to be for two unrelated genes. The further away an observed
		CRISPR score is from its expected score the more we suspect
		genetic interaction. The work in this package is based off of
		original research from the Alice Berger lab at Fred Hutchinson
		Cancer Center (2021) doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109597.
