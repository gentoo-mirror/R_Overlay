		Some Algorithms for Mixed Models // This program can be used to
		fit Gaussian linear mixed models (LMM). Univariate and
		multivariate response models, multiple variance components, as
		well as, certain correlation and covariance structures are
		supported. In many occasions, the user can pick one of the
		several mixed model fitting algorithms, which are explained
		further in the details section. Some algorithms are specific to
		certain types of models (univariate or multivariate, diagonal
		or non-diagonal residual, one or multiple variance components,
		etc,...).
