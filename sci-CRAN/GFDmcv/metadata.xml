		General Hypothesis Testing Problems for Multivariate Coefficients
		of Variation // Performs test procedures for general hypothesis
		testing problems for four multivariate coefficients of
		variation (Ditzhaus and Smaga, 2023 arXiv:2301.12009). We can
		verify the global hypothesis about equality as well as the
		particular hypotheses defined by contrasts, e.g., we can
		conduct post hoc tests. We also provide the simultaneous
		confidence intervals for contrasts.
