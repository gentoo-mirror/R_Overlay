		Differential Evolution Optimization in Pure R // Differential
		Evolution (DE) stochastic heuristic algorithms for global
		optimization of problems with and without general constraints.
		The aim is to curate a collection of its variants that (1) do
		not sacrifice simplicity of design, (2) are essentially tuning-
		free, and (3) can be efficiently implemented directly in the R
		language. Currently, it provides implementations of the
		algorithms 'jDE' by Brest et al. (2006)
		doi:10.1109/TEVC.2006.872133 for single-objective optimization
		and 'NCDE' by Qu et al. (2012) doi:10.1109/TEVC.2011.2161873
		for multimodal optimization (single-objective problems with
		multiple solutions).
