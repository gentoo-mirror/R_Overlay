		Residual Diagnostics for Hierarchical (Multi-Level / Mixed)
		Regression Models // The 'DHARMa' package uses a simulation-
		based approach to create readily interpretable scaled
		(quantile) residuals for fitted (generalized) linear mixed
		models. Currently supported are linear and generalized linear
		(mixed) models from 'lme4' (classes 'lmerMod', 'glmerMod'),
		'glmmTMB' and 'spaMM', generalized additive models ('gam' from
		'mgcv'), 'glm' (including 'negbin' from 'MASS', but excluding
		quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model classes. Moreover,
		externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive
		simulations from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN', or
		'BUGS' can be processed as well. The resulting residuals are
		standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted
		as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression. The
		package also provides a number of plot and test functions for
		typical model misspecification problems, such as
		over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and residual spatial and
		temporal autocorrelation.
