		Functions for Epidemiological Analysis using Population Data //
		Enables computation of epidemiological statistics, including
		those where counts or mortality rates of the reference
		population are used.  Currently supported: excess hazard models
		(Dickman, Sloggett, Hills, and Hakulinen (2012)
		doi:10.1002/sim.1597), rates, mean survival times, relative/net
		survival (in particular the Ederer II (Ederer and Heise (1959))
		and Pohar Perme (Pohar Perme, Stare, and Esteve (2012)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01640.x) estimators), and
		standardized incidence and mortality ratios, all of which can
		be easily adjusted for by covariates such as age. Fast
		splitting and aggregation of 'Lexis' objects (from package
		'Epi') and other computations achieved using 'data.table'.
