		Functions for Epidemiological Analysis using Population Data //
		Enables computation of epidemiological statistics, including
		those where counts or mortality rates of the reference
		population are used. Currently supported: excess hazard models,
		rates, mean survival times, relative survival, and standardized
		incidence and mortality ratios (SIRs/SMRs), all of which can be
		easily adjusted for by covariates such as age. Fast splitting
		and aggregation of 'Lexis' objects (from package 'Epi') and
		other computations achieved using 'data.table'.
