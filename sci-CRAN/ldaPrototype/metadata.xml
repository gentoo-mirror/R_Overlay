		Prototype of Multiple Latent Dirichlet Allocation Runs //
		Determine a Prototype from a number of runs of Latent Dirichlet
		Allocation (LDA) measuring its similarities with S-CLOP: A
		procedure to select the LDA run with highest mean pairwise
		similarity, which is measured by S-CLOP (Similarity of multiple
		sets by Clustering with Local Pruning), to all other runs. LDA
		runs are specified by its assignments leading to estimators for
		distribution parameters. Repeated runs lead to different
		results, which we encounter by choosing the most representative
		LDA run as prototype.
