		Model Selection in Multivariate Longitudinal Data Analysis // An
		efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed for Bayesian
		multivariate longitudinal data analysis with the focus on
		selection of important elements in the generalized
		autoregressive matrix. It provides posterior samples and
		estimates of parameters. In addition, estimates of several
		information criteria such as Akaike information criterion
		(AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance
		information criterion (DIC) and prediction accuracy such as the
		marginal predictive likelihood (MPL) and the mean squared
		prediction error (MSPE) are provided for model selection.
