		Small Area Estimation under ZIB Distribution using Hierarchical
		Bayesian // Provides function for area level of small area
		estimation using hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method with Zero-
		Inflated Binomial (ZIB) distribution for variables of interest.
		Some dataset produced by a data generation are also provided.
		The 'rjags' package is employed to obtain parameter estimates.
		Model-based estimators involves the HB estimators which include
		the mean and the variation of mean. For references, see Wiley
