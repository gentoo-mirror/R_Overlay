		Small Area Estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian under Zero
		Inflated Binomial Distribution // Provides function for area
		level of small area estimation using hierarchical Bayesian (HB)
		method with Zero-Inflated Binomial distribution for variables
		of interest. Some dataset produced by a data generation are
		also provided. The 'rjags' package is employed to obtain
