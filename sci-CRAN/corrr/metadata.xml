		Correlations in R // A tool for exploring correlations.  It makes
		it possible to easily perform routine tasks when exploring
		correlation matrices such as ignoring the diagonal, focusing on
		the correlations of certain variables against others, or
		rearranging and visualizing the matrix in terms of the strength
		of the correlations.
