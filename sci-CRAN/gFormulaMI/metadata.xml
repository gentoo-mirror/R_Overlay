		G-Formula for Causal Inference via Multiple Imputation //
		Implements the G-Formula method for causal inference with time-
		varying treatments and confounders using Bayesian multiple
		imputation methods, as described by Bartlett, Olarte Parra and
		Daniel (2023) arXiv:2301.12026. It creates multiple synthetic
		imputed datasets under treatment regimes of interest using the
		'mice' package. These can then be analysed using rules
		developed for analysing multiple synthetic datasets.
