		Quantifying Habitat-Induced Acoustic Signal Degradation //
		Intended to facilitate acoustic analysis of (animal) sound
		transmission experiments, which typically aim to quantify
		changes in signal structure when transmitted in a given habitat
		by broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds at increasing
		distances. The package offers a workflow with functions to
		prepare the data set for analysis as well as to calculate and
		visualize several degradation metrics, including blur ratio,
		signal-to-noise ratio, excess attenuation and envelope
		correlation among others (Dabelsteen et al 1993
		doi:10.1121/1.406682).
