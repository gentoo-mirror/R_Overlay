		Bayesian Quantile Elastic Net for Genetic Study // As heavy-
		tailed error distribution and outliers in the response variable
		widely exist, models which are robust to data contamination are
		highly demanded. Here, we develop a novel robust Bayesian
		variable selection method with elastic net penalty for quantile
		regression in genetic analysis. In particular, the spike-and-
		slab priors have been incorporated to impose sparsity. An
		efficient Gibbs sampler has been developed to facilitate
		computation.The core modules of the package have been developed
		in 'C++' and R.
