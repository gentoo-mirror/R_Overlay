		Affine Invariant Tests of Multivariate Normality // Various
		affine invariant multivariate normality tests are provided. It
		is designed to accompany the survey article Ebner, B. and
		Henze, N. (2020) arXiv:2004.07332 titled "Tests for
		multivariate normality -- a critical review with emphasis on
		weighted L^2-statistics". We implement new and time honoured
		L^2-type tests of multivariate normality, such as the
		Baringhaus-Henze-Epps-Pulley (BHEP) test, the Henze-Zirkler
		test, the test of Henze-Jimnes-Gamero, the test of Henze-
		Jimnes-Gamero-Meintanis, the test of Henze-Visage, the Drr-
		Ebner-Henze test based on harmonic oscillator and the Drr-
		Ebner-Henze test based on a double estimation in a PDE.
		Secondly, we include the measures of multivariate skewness and
		kurtosis by Mardia, Koziol, Malkovich and Afifi and Mri,
		Rohatgi and Szkely, as well as the associated tests. Thirdly,
		we include the tests of multivariate normality by Cox and
		Small, the 'energy' test of Szkely and Rizzo, the tests based
		on spherical harmonics by Manzotti and Quiroz and the test of
		Pudelko. All the functions and tests need the data to be a n x
		d matrix where n is the samplesize (number of rows) and d is
		the dimension (number of columns).
