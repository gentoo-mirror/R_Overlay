		Using CF-Compliant Calendars with Climate Projection Data //
		Support for all calendars as specified in the Climate and
		Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions for climate and forecasting
		data. The CF Metadata Conventions is widely used for
		distributing files with climate observations or projections,
		including the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) data
		used by climate change scientists and the Intergovernmental
		Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This package specifically
		allows the user to work with any of the CF-compliant calendars
		(many of which are not compliant with POSIXt). The CF time
		coordinate is formally defined in the CF Metadata Conventions
		document available at https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-
		conventions/cf-conventions-1.12/cf-conventions.html#time-
		coordinate.
