		Analysis of Plant Disease Epidemics // A toolbox to make it easy
		to analyze plant disease epidemics. It provides a common
		framework for plant disease intensity data recorded over time
		and/or space. Implemented statistical methods are currently
		mainly focused on spatial pattern analysis (e.g., aggregation
		indices, Taylor and binary power laws, distribution fitting,
		SADIE and mapcomp methods). See Madden LV, Hughes G, van den
		Bosch F (2007, ISBN: 978-089054-354-2) for further information
		on these methods. Several data sets that were mainly published
		in plant disease epidemiology literature are also included in
		this package.
