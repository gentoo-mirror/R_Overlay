		Analysis of Plant Disease Epidemics // A toolbox to make it easy
		to analyze plant disease epidemics. It provides a common
		framework for plant disease intensity data recorded over time
		and/or space. Implemented statistical methods are currently
		mainly focused on spatial pattern analysis (e.g., aggregation
		indices, Taylor and binary power laws, distribution fitting,
		SADIE and 'mapcomp' methods). See Laurence V. Madden, Gareth
		Hughes, Franck van den Bosch (2007) doi:10.1094/9780890545058
		for further information on these methods. Several data sets
		that were mainly published in plant disease epidemiology
		literature are also included in this package.
