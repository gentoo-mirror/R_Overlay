		Underlying Graphs of Proximity Catch Digraphs and Their
		Applications // Contains the functions for construction and
		visualization of underlying and reflexivity graphs of the three
		families of the proximity catch digraphs (PCDs), see (Ceyhan
		(2005) ISBN:978-3-639-19063-2), and for computing the edge
		density of these PCD-based graphs which are then used for
		testing the patterns of segregation and association against
		complete spatial randomness (CSR)) or uniformity in one and two
		dimensional cases. The PCD families considered are Arc-Slice
		PCDs, Proportional-Edge (PE) PCDs (Ceyhan et al. (2006)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2005.03.002) and Central Similarity PCDs
		(Ceyhan et al. (2007) doi:10.1002/cjs.5550350106). See also
		(Ceyhan (2016) doi:10.1016/j.stamet.2016.07.003) for edge
		density of the underlying and reflexivity graphs of PE-PCDs.
		The package also has tools for visualization of PCD-based
		graphs for one, two, and three dimensional data.
