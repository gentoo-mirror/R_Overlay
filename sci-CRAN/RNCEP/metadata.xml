		Obtain, Organize, and Visualize NCEP Weather Data // Contains
		functions to retrieve, organize, and visualize weather data
		from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis
		(https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html)
		and NCEP/DOE Reanalysis II
		(https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html)
		datasets.  Data are queried via the Internet and may be
		obtained for a specified spatial and temporal extent or
		interpolated to a point in space and time.  We also provide
		functions to visualize these weather data on a map.  There are
		also functions to simulate flight trajectories according to
		specified behavior using either NCEP wind data or data
		specified by the user.
