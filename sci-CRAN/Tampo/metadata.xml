		Tools for the Analysis of Microchemical Profiles from Otoliths //
		Facilitates analyzing microchemical profiles (both mono- and
		multielemental composition) from fish otoliths (stones from the
		inner ear) using a recursive partitioning approach that can
		accommodate some form of user-specified constraints. It also
		allows extracting environmental histories from otolith based on
		typical elemental sequences generated using methods such as LA-
		ICPMS. Microchemical analysis is widely used in fisheries
		management and fisheries biology to identify stocks and
		characterize fish movements but the provided functions may be
		considered from the more general perspective of the
		chronological clustering of multivariate time series using
		piecewise constant regressions.
