		Detect and Characterize Sub-Daily Flow Fluctuations // An
		important environmental impact on running water ecosystems is
		caused by hydropeaking - the discontinuous release of turbine
		water because of peaks of energy demand. An event-based
		algorithm is implemented to detect flow fluctuations referring
		to increase events (IC) and decrease events (DC). For each
		event, a set of parameters related to the fluctuation intensity
		is calculated: maximum flow fluctuation rate mafr(), mean flow
		fluctuation rate mefr(), amplitude amp(), flow ratio fr(), and
		duration dur(). The framework is introduced in Greimel et al.
		(2016) "A method to detect and characterize sub-daily flow
		fluctuations" doi:10.1002/hyp.10773 and can be used to identify
		different fluctuation types according to the potential source:
		e.g., sub-daily flow fluctuations caused by hydropeaking,
		rainfall, or snow and glacier melt.
