		Detect and Characterize Sub-Daily Flow Fluctuations // An
		important environmental impact on running water ecosystems is
		caused by hydropeaking - the discontinuous release of turbine
		water because of peaks of energy demand. An event-based
		algorithm is implemented to detect flow fluctuations referring
		to increase events (IC) and decrease events (DC). For each
		event, a set of parameters related to the fluctuation intensity
		is calculated. The framework is introduced in Greimel et al.
		(2016) "A method to detect and characterize sub-daily flow
		fluctuations" doi:10.1002/hyp.10773 and can be used to identify
		different fluctuation types according to the potential source:
		e.g., sub-daily flow fluctuations caused by hydropeaking,
		rainfall, or snow and glacier melt. This is a companion to the
		package 'hydroroute', which is used to detect and follow
		hydropower plant-specific hydropeaking waves at the sub-
		catchment scale and to describe how hydropeaking flow
		parameters change along the longitudinal flow path as proposed
		and validated in Greimel et al. (2022).
