		Multilevel Monitoring System Data for Wells in the USGS INL
		Aquifer Monitoring Network // Analysis-ready datasets detailing
		the Multilevel Monitoring System (MLMS) wells within the U.S.
		Geological Survey's (USGS) aquifer-monitoring network at the
		Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in Idaho, and the data
		collected within these wells. Supported by the U.S. Department
		of Energy (DOE), the USGS collected discrete measurements of
		hydraulic head at various depths from wells in the eastern
		Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer over several years. These
		measurements were derived from data on fluid pressure, fluid
		temperature, and atmospheric pressure. Each well was equipped
		with an MLMS, which included valved measurement ports, packer
		bladders, casing segments, and couplers. The MLMS facilitated
		monitoring at multiple hydraulically isolated depth intervals,
		reaching significant depths below the land surface.
		Additionally, groundwater samples were collected from these
		wells over multiple years and analyzed for various chemical and
		physical parameters.
