		Estimates PET neuroreceptor occupancies // This package provides
		a generic function for estimating positron emission tomography
		(PET) neuroreceptor occupancies from the total volumes of
		distribution of a set of regions of interest. Fittings methods
		include the simple 'reference region' and 'ordinary least
		squares' (sometimes known as occupancy plot) methods, as well
		as the more efficient 'restricted maximum likelihood
		estimation'.
