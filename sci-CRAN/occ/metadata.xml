		Estimation of PET Neuroreceptor Occupancies // Estimate the
		positron emission tomography (PET) neuroreceptor occupancies
		from the total volumes of distribution of a set of regions of
		interest. Fitting methods include the simple 'reference
		region', 'ordinary least squares' (sometimes known as occupancy
		plot), and 'restricted maximum likelihood estimation'.
