		Estimates PET Neuroreceptor Occupancies // Generic function for
		estimating positron emission tomography (PET) neuroreceptor
		occupancies from the total volumes of distribution of a set of
		regions of interest. Fittings methods include the simple
		'reference region' and 'ordinary least squares' (sometimes
		known as occupancy plot) methods, as well as the more efficient
		'restricted maximum likelihood estimation'.
