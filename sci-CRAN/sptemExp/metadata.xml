		Constrained Spatiotemporal Mixed Models for Exposure Estimation
		// The approach of constrained spatiotemporal mixed models is
		to make reliable estimation of air pollutant concentrations at
		high spatiotemporal resolution (Li, L., Zhang, J., Meng, X.,
		Fang, Y., Ge, Y., Wang, J., Wang, C., Wu, J., Kan, H. (2018)
		doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.09.001; Li, L., Lurmann, F., Habre,
		R., Urman, R., Rappaport, E., Ritz, B., Chen, J., Gilliland,
		F., Wu, J., (2017) doi:10.1021/acs.est.7b01864). This package
		is an extensive tool for this modeling approach with support of
		block Kriging (Goovaerts, P. (1997)
		http://www.gbv.de/dms/goettingen/229148123.pdf) and uses the
		PM2.5 modeling as examples. It provides the following
		functionality: (1) Extraction of covariates from the satellite
		images such as GeoTiff and NC4 raster; (2) Generation of
		temporal basis functions to simulate the seasonal trends in the
		study regions; (3) Generation of the regional monthly or yearly
		means of air pollutant concentration; (4) Generation of
		Thiessen polygons and spatial effect modeling; (5) Ensemble
		modeling for spatiotemporal mixed models, supporting multi-core
		parallel computing; (6) Integrated predictions with or without
		weights of the model's performance, supporting multi-core
		parallel computing; (7) Constrained optimization to interpolate
		the missing values; (8) Generation of the grid surfaces of air
		pollutant concentration estimates at high resolution; (9) Block
		Kriging for regional mean estimation at multiple scales.
