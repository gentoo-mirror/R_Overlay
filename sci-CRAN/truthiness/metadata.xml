		Illusory Truth Longitudinal Study // Data and functions for
		analyzing and simulating illusory truth datasets, developed as
		part of a longitudinal study by Henderson, Barr, and Simons
		(2020). The illusory truth effect is the observation that
		people rate repeated statements as more likely to be true than
		novel statements. We tested the trajectory of the illusory
		truth effect by collecting truth ratings for statements
		repeated across four time intervals: immediately, one day, one
		week, and one month following initial presentation. The package
		contains the anonymized data from the study along with stimulus
		materials, as well as functions for analyzing the data, running
		simulations, and calculating power. Further details about the
		project are available at https://osf.io/nvugt/, which includes
		Stage 1 of the Registered Report at the Journal of Cognition
		(https://osf.io/vqnx2/).
