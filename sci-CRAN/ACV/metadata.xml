		Optimal Out-of-Sample Forecast Evaluation and Testing under
		Stationarity // Package 'ACV' (short for Affine Cross-
		Validation) offers an improved time-series cross-validation
		loss estimator which utilizes both in-sample and out-of-sample
		forecasting performance via a carefully constructed affine
		weighting scheme. Under the assumption of stationarity, the
		estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator of the out-of-
		sample loss. Besides that, the package also offers improved
		versions of Diebold-Mariano and Ibragimov-Muller tests of equal
		predictive ability which deliver more power relative to their
		conventional counterparts. For more information, see the
		accompanying article Stanek (2021) doi:10.2139/ssrn.3996166.
