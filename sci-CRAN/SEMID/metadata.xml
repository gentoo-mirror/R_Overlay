		Identifiability of Linear Structural Equation Models // Provides
		routines to check identifiability or non-identifiability of
		linear structural equation models as described in Drton,
		Foygel, and Sullivant (2011) DOI:10.1214/10-AOS859, Foygel,
		Draisma, and Drton (2012) DOI:10.1214/12-AOS1012, and other
		works. The routines are based on the graphical representation
		of structural equation models by a path diagram/mixed graph.
