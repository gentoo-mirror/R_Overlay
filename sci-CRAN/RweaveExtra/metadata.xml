		Sweave Drivers with Extra Tricks Up their Sleeve // Weave and
		tangle drivers for Sweave extending the standard drivers.
		RweaveExtraLatex and RtangleExtra provide options to completely
		ignore code chunks on weaving, tangling, or both. Chunks
		ignored on weaving are not parsed, yet are written out verbatim
		on tangling. Chunks ignored on tangling may be evaluated as
		usual on weaving, but are completely left out of the tangled
		scripts. The driver RtangleExtra also provides an option to
		specify the extension of the file name (or remove it entirely)
		when splitting is selected on tangling.
