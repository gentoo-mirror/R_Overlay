		Sweave Drivers with Extra Tricks Up their Sleeve // Weave and
		tangle drivers for Sweave extending the standard drivers with
		additional code chunk options. Currently, these are only
		options to completely ignore, or skip, code chunks on weaving,
		tangling, or both. Chunks ignored on weaving are not parsed and
		are written out verbatim on tangling. Chunks ignored on
		tangling are processed as usual on weaving, but completely left
		out of the tangled scripts.
