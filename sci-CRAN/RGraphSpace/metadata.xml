		A Lightweight Interface Between 'ggplot2' and 'igraph' Objects //
		Interface to integrate 'igraph' and 'ggplot2' graphics within
		spatial maps. 'RGraphSpace' implements new geometric objects
		using 'ggplot2' prototypes, customized for representing large
		'igraph' objects in a normalized coordinate system. By scaling
		shapes and graph elements, 'RGraphSpace' can provide a
		framework for layered visualizations.
