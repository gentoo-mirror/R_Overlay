		A Lightweight Package for Representing Large 'igraph' Objects in
		a Normalized Coordinate System // Interface to integrate
		'igraph' and 'ggplot2' graphics within spatial maps.
		'RGraphSpace' implements new geometric objects using 'ggplot2'
		prototypes, customized for representing large 'igraph' objects
		in a normalized coordinate system. By scaling shapes and graph
		elements, 'RGraphSpace' can provide a framework for layered
		visualizations.
