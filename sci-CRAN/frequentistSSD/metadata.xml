		Screened Selection Design with Survival Endpoints // A study
		based on the screened selection design (SSD) is an exploratory
		phase II randomized trial with two or more arms but without
		concurrent control. The primary aim of the SSD trial is to pick
		a desirable treatment arm (e.g., in terms of the median
		survival time) to recommend to the subsequent randomized phase
		IIb (with the concurrent control) or phase III. Though The
		survival endpoint is often encountered in phase II trials, the
		existing SSD methods cannot deal with the survival endpoint.
		Furthermore, the existing SSD wont control the type I error
		rate.  The proposed designs can partially control or provide
		the empirical type I error/false positive rate by an optimal
		algorithm (implemented by the optimal() function) for each arm.
		All the design needed components (sample size, operating
		characteristics) are supported.
