		Moran Eigenvector-Based Spatial Regression Models // Functions
		for estimating spatial varying coefficient models, mixed
		models, and other spatial regression models for Gaussian and
		non-Gaussian data. Moran eigenvectors are used to an
		approximate Gaussian process modeling which is interpretable in
		terms of the Moran coefficient. The GP is used for modeling the
		spatial processes in residuals and regression coefficients. For
		details see Murakami (2021) arXiv:1703.04467v10.
