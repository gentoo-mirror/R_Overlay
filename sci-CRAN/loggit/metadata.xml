		Modern Logging for the R Ecosystem // An effortless 'ndjson'
		(newline-delimited 'JSON') logger, with two primary log-writing
		interfaces. It provides a set of wrappings for base R's
		message(), warning(), and stop() functions that maintain
		identical functionality, but also log the handler message to an
		'ndjson' log file. 'loggit' also exports its internal
		'loggit()' function for powerful and configurable custom
		logging. No change in existing code is necessary to use this
		package, and should only require additions to fully leverage
		the power of the logging system. 'loggit' also provides a log
		reader for reading an 'ndjson' log file into a data frame, log
		rotation, and live echo of the 'ndjson' log messages to
		terminal 'stdout' for log capture by external systems (like
		containers). 'loggit' is ideal for Shiny apps, data pipelines,
		modeling work flows, and more. Please see the vignettes for
		detailed example use cases.
