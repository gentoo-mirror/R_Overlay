		Effortless Exception Logging // A very simple and easy-to-use set
		of suspiciously-familiar functions. 'loggit' provides a set of
		wrappings for base R's message(), warning(), and stop()
		functions that maintain identical functionality, but also log
		the handler message to a 'JSON' log file. While mostly
		automatic, powerful custom logging is available via these
		handlers' logging function, loggit(), which is also exported
		for use. No change in existing code is necessary to use this
		package.
