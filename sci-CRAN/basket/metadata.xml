		Basket Trial Analysis // Implementation of multisource
		exchangeability models for Bayesian analyses of prespecified
		subgroups arising in the context of basket trial design and
		monitoring.  The R 'basket' package facilitates implementation
		of the binary, symmetric multi-source exchangeability model
		(MEM) with posterior inference arising from both exact
		computation and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Analysis
		output includes full posterior samples as well as posterior
		probabilities, highest posterior density (HPD) interval
		boundaries, effective sample sizes (ESS), mean and median
		estimations, posterior exchangeability probability matrices,
		and maximum a posteriori MEMs. In addition to providing
		"basketwise" analyses, the package includes similar
		calculations for "clusterwise" analyses for which subgroups are
		combined into meta-baskets, or clusters, using graphical
		clustering algorithms that treat the posterior exchangeability
		probabilities as edge weights. In addition plotting tools are
		provided to visualize basket and cluster densities as well as
		their exchangeability.  References include Hyman, D.M.,
