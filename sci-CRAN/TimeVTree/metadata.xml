		Survival Analysis of Time Varying Coefficients Using a Tree-Based
		Approach // Estimates time varying regression effects under Cox
		type models in survival data using classification and
		regression tree. The codes in this package were originally
		written in S-Plus for the paper "Survival Analysis with Time-
		Varying Regression Effects Using a Tree-Based Approach," by Xu,
		R. and Adak, S. (2002) doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2002.00305.x,
		Biometrics, 58: 305-315. Development of this package was
		supported by NIH grants AG053983 and AG057707, and by the UCSD
		Altman Translational Research Institute, NIH grant UL1TR001442.
