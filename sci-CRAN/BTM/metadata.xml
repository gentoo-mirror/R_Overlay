		Biterm Topic Models for Short Text // Biterm Topic Models find
		topics in collections of short texts. It is a word co-
		occurrence based topic model that learns topics by modeling
		word-word co-occurrences patterns which are called biterms.
		This in contrast to traditional topic models like Latent
		Dirichlet Allocation and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
		which are word-document co-occurrence topic models. A biterm
		consists of two words co-occurring in the same short text
		window. This context window can for example be a twitter
		message, a short answer on a survey, a sentence of a text or a
		document identifier. The techniques are explained in detail in
		the paper 'A Biterm Topic Model For Short Text' by Xiaohui Yan,
		Jiafeng Guo, Yanyan Lan, Xueqi Cheng (2013) https://github.com/
		xiaohuiyan/xiaohuiyan.github.io/blob/master/paper/BTM-
		WWW13.pdf.
