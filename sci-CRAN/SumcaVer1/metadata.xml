		Mean Square Prediction Error Estimation in Small Area Estimation
		// Estimation of mean squared prediction error of a small area
		predictor is provided. In particular, the recent method of
		Simple, Unified, Monte-Carlo Assisted approach for the mean
		squared prediction error estimation of small area predictor is
		provided. We also provide other existing methods of mean
		squared prediction error estimation such as jackknife method
		for the mixed logistic model.
