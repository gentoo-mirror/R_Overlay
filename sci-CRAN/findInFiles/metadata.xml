		Find Pattern in Files // Creates a HTML widget which displays the
		results of searching for a pattern in files in a given folder.
		The results can be viewed in the 'RStudio' viewer pane,
		included in a 'R Markdown' document or in a 'Shiny'
		application. Also provides a 'Shiny' application allowing to
		run this widget and to navigate in the files found by the
		search. Instead of creating a HTML widget, it is also possible
		to get the results of the search in a 'tibble'. The search is
		performed by the 'grep' command-line utility.
