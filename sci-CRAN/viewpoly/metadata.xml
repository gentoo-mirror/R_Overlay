		A Shiny App to Visualize Genetic Maps and QTL Analysis in
		Polyploid Species // Provides a graphical user interface to
		integrate, visualize and explore results from linkage and
		quantitative trait loci analysis, together with genomic
		information for autopolyploid species. The app is meant for
		interactive use and allows users to optionally upload different
		sources of information, including  gene annotation and
		alignment files, enabling the exploitation and search for
		candidate genes in a genome browser. In its current version,
		'VIEWpoly' supports inputs from 'MAPpoly', 'polymapR',
		'diaQTL', 'QTLpoly', 'polyqtlR', 'GWASpoly', and 'HIDECAN'
		packages.
