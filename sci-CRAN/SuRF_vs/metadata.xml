		Subsampling Ranking Forward Selection (SuRF) // Performs variable
		selection based on subsampling, ranking forward selection. Xo
		is the matrix of predictor variables. y is the response
		variable. Currently only binary responses using logistic
		regression are supported. X is a matrix of additional
		predictors which should be scaled to have sum 1 prior to
		analysis. fold is the number of folds for cross-validation.
		Alpha is the parameter for the elastic net method used in the
		subsampling procedure: the default value of 1 corresponds to
		LASSO. prop is the proportion of variables to remove in the
		each subsample. weights indicates whether observations should
		be weighted by class size. When the class sizes are unbalanced,
		weighting observations can improve results. B is the number of
		subsamples to use for ranking the variables. C is the number of
		permutations to use for estimating the critical value of the
		null distribution. If the 'doParallel' package is installed,
		the function can be run in parallel by setting ncores to the
		number of threads to use. If the default value of 1 is used, or
		if the 'doParallel' package is not installed, the function does
		not run in parallel. display.progress indicates whether the
		function should display messages indicating its progress.
		family is a family variable for the glm() fitting. Note that
		the 'glmnet' package does not permit the use of nonstandard
		link functions, so will always use the default link function.
		However, the glm() fitting will use the specified link. The
		default is binomial with logistic regression, because this is a
		common use case. pval is the p-value for inclusion of a
		variable in the model. Under the null case, the number of false
		positives will be geometrically distributed with this as
		probability of success, so if this parameter is set to p, the
		expected number of false positives should be p/(1-p).
