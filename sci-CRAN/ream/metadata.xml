		Density, Distribution, and Sampling Functions for Evidence
		Accumulation Models // Calculate the probability density
		functions (PDFs) for two threshold evidence accumulation models
		(EAMs). These are defined using the following Stochastic
		Differential Equation (SDE), dx(t) = v(x(t),t)*dt+D(x(t),t)*dW,
		where x(t) is the accumulated evidence at time t, v(x(t),t) is
		the drift rate, D(x(t),t) is the noise scale, and W is the
		standard Wiener process. The boundary conditions of this
		process are the upper and lower decision thresholds,
		represented by b_u(t) and b_l(t), respectively. Upper threshold
		b_u(t)  0, while lower threshold b_l(t)  0. The initial
		condition of this process x(0) = z where b_l(t)  z  b_u(t). We
		represent this as the relative start point w =
		z/(b_u(0)-b_l(0)), defined as a ratio of the initial threshold
		location. This package generates the PDF using the same
		approach as the 'python' package it is based upon, 'PyBEAM' by
		Murrow and Holmes (2023) doi:10.3758/s13428-023-02162-w. First,
		it converts the SDE model into the forwards Fokker-Planck
		equation dp(x,t)/dt =
		d(v(x,t)*p(x,t))/dt-0.5*d^2(D(x,t)^2*p(x,t))/dx^2, then solves
		this equation using the Crank-Nicolson method to determine
		p(x,t). Finally, it calculates the flux at the decision
		thresholds, f_i(t) = 0.5*d(D(x,t)^2*p(x,t))/dx evaluated at x =
		b_i(t), where i is the relevant decision threshold, either
		upper (i = u) or lower (i = l). The flux at each thresholds
		f_i(t) is the PDF for each threshold, specifically its PDF. We
		discuss further details of this approach in this package and
		'PyBEAM' publications. Additionally, one can calculate the
		cumulative distribution functions of and sampling from the
		EAMs.
