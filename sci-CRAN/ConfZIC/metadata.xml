		Confidence Envelopes for Model Selection Criteria Based on
		Minimum ZIC // Narrow down the number of models to look at in
		model selection using the confidence envelopes based on the
		minimum ZIC (Generalized Information Criteria) values for
		regression and time series data. Functions involve the
		computation of multivariate normal-probabilities with
		covariance matrices based on minimum ZIC inverting the CDF of
		the minimum ZIC. It involves both the computation of singular
		and non-singular probabilities as described in Genz (1992)
