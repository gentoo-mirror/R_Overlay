		Tidy Prediction and Plotting of Generalised Additive Models //
		Provides functions that compute predictions from Generalised
		Additive Models (GAMs) fitted with 'mgcv' and return them as a
		tibble. These can be plotted with a generic plot()-method that
		uses 'ggplot2' or plotted as any other data frame. The main
		function is predict_gam().
