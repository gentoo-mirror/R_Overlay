		Privacy-Protecting Hazard Ratio Estimation in Distributed Data
		Networks // An implementation of the one-step privacy-
		protecting method for estimating the overall and site-specific
		hazard ratios using inverse probability weighted Cox models in
		distributed data network studies, as proposed by Shu, Yoshida,
		Fireman, and Toh (2019) doi: 10.1177/0962280219869742. This
		method only requires sharing of summary-level riskset tables
		instead of individual-level data. Both the conventional inverse
		probability weights and the stabilized weights are implemented.
