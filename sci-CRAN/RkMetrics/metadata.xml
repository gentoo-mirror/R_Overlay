		Hybrid Mortality Estimation // Hybrid Mortality Modelling (HMM)
		provides a framework in which mortality around "the accident
		hump" and at very old ages can be modelled under a single
		model. The graphics' codes necessary for visualization of the
		models' output are included here. Specifically, the graphics
		are based on the assumption that, the mortality rates can be
		expressed as a function of the area under the curve between the
		crude mortality rates plots and the tangential transform of the
		force of mortality.
