		Independent component analysis using score functions from the
		Pearson system // The Pearson-ICA algorithm is a mutual
		information-based method for blind separation of statistically
		independent source signals. It has been shown that the
		minimization of mutual information leads to iterative use of
		score functions, i.e. derivatives of log densities. The Pearson
		system allows adaptive modeling of score functions. The
		flexibility of the Pearson system makes it possible to model a
		wide range of source distributions including asymmetric
		distributions. The algorithm is designed especially for
		problems with asymmetric sources but it works for symmetric
		sources as well.
