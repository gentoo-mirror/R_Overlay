		Design and Analysis of Non-Inferiority Trials // Provides tools
		to help the design and analysis of resilient non-inferiority
		trials. These include functions for sample size calculations
		and analyses of trials, with either a risk difference, risk
		ratio or arc-sine difference margin, and a function to run
		simulations to design a trial with the methods described in
		Quartagno et al. (2019) arXiv:1905.00241.
