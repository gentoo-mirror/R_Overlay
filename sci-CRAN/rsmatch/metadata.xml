		Matching Methods for Time-Varying Observational Studies //
		Implements popular methods for matching in time-varying
		observational studies. Matching is difficult in this scenario
		because participants can be treated at different times which
		may have an influence on the outcomes. The core methods
		include: "Balanced Risk Set Matching" from Li, Propert, and
		Rosenbaum (2011) doi:10.1198/016214501753208573 and "Propensity
		Score Matching with Time-Dependent Covariates" from Lu (2005)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00356.x. Some functions use the
		'Gurobi' optimization back-end to improve the optimization
		problem speed; the 'gurobi' R package and associated software
		can be downloaded from https://www.gurobi.com after obtaining a
		license.
