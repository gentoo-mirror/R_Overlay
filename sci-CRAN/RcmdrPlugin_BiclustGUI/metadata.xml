		'Rcmdr' Plug-in GUI for Biclustering // A plug-in for R Commander
		('Rcmdr'). The package is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in
		which several biclustering methods can be executed, followed by
		diagnostics and plots of the results. Further, the GUI also has
		the possibility to connect the methods to more general
		diagnostic packages for biclustering. Biclustering methods from
		'biclust', 'fabia', 's4vd', 'iBBiG', 'isa2', 'BiBitR', 'rqubic'
		and 'BicARE' are implemented. Additionally, 'superbiclust' and
		'BcDiag' are also implemented to be able to further investigate
		results. The GUI also provides a couple of extra utilities to
		export, save, search through and plot the results.
		'RcmdrPlugin.BiclustGUI' also provides a very specific
		framework for biclustering in which new methods, diagnostics
		and plots can be added. Scripts were prepared so that R-package
		developers can freely design their own dialogs in the GUI which
		can then be added by the maintainer of
		'RcmdrPlugin.BiclustGUI'. These scripts do not required any
		knowledge of 'tcltk' and 'Rcmdr' and are easy to fill in.
		(Note: rqubic currently requires manual installation through
		BiocManager::install('rqubic').)
