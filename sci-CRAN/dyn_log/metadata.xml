		Dynamic Logging for R Inspired by Configuration Driven
		Development // A comprehensive and dynamic configuration driven
		logging package for R. While there are several excellent
		logging solutions already in the R ecosystem, I always feel
		constrained in some way by each of them. Every project is
		designed differently to solve it's domain specific problem, and
		ultimately the utility of a logging solution is its ability to
		adapt to this design. This is the raison d'tre for 'dyn.log':
		to provide a modular design, template mechanics and a
		configuration-based integration model, so that the logger can
		integrate deeply into your design, even though it knows nothing
		about it.
