		Bayesian BIN (Bias, Information, Noise) Model of Forecasting // A
		recently proposed Bayesian BIN model disentangles the
		underlying processes that enable forecasters and forecasting
		methods to improve, decomposing forecasting accuracy into three
		components: bias, partial information, and noise. By describing
		the differences between two groups of forecasters, the model
		allows the user to carry out useful inference, such as
		calculating the posterior probabilities of the treatment
		reducing bias, diminishing noise, or increasing information. It
		also provides insight into how much tamping down bias and noise
		in judgment or enhancing the efficient extraction of valid
		information from the environment improves forecasting accuracy.
		This package provides easy access to the BIN model. For further
		information refer to the paper Ville A. Satop, Marat Salikhov,
		Philip E. Tetlock, and Barbara Mellers (2021) "Bias,
		Information, Noise: The BIN Model of Forecasting"
