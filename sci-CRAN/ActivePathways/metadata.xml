		Integrative Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Multivariate Omics
		Data // Framework for analysing multiple omics datasets in the
		context of molecular pathways, biological processes and other
		types of gene sets. The package uses p-value merging to combine
		gene- or protein-level signals, followed by ranked
		hypergeometric tests to determine enriched pathways and
		processes. Genes can be integrated using directional
		constraints that reflect how the input datasets are expected
		interact with one another. This approach allows researchers to
		interpret a series of omics datasets in the context of known
		biology and gene function, and discover associations that are
		only apparent when several datasets are combined. The recent
		version of the package is part of the following publication:
		Directional integration and pathway enrichment analysis for
		multi-omics data. Slobodyanyuk M^, Bahcheli AT^, Klein ZP,
		Bayati M, Strug LJ, Reimand J. Nature Communications (2024)
		doi:10.1038/s41467-024-49986-4.
