		Integrative Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Multivariate Omics
		Data // Framework for analysing multiple omics datasets in the
		context of molecular pathways, biological processes and other
		types of gene sets. The package uses p-value merging to combine
		gene- or protein-level signals, followed by ranked
		hypergeometric tests to determine enriched pathways and
		processes. This approach allows researchers to interpret a
		series of omics datasets in the context of known biology and
		gene function, and discover associations that are only apparent
		when several datasets are combined. The package is part of the
		following publication: Integrative Pathway Enrichment Analysis
		of Multivariate Omics Data. Paczkowska M^, Barenboim J^,
		Sintupisut N, Fox NS, Zhu H, Abd-Rabbo D, Mee MW, Boutros PC,
		PCAWG Drivers and Functional Interpretation Working Group;
		Reimand J, PCAWG Consortium. Nature Communications (2020)
