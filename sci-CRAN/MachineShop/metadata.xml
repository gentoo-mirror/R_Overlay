		Machine Learning Models and Tools // Meta-package for statistical
		and machine learning with a unified interface for model
		fitting, prediction, performance assessment, and presentation
		of results.  Approaches for model fitting and prediction of
		numerical, categorical, or censored time-to-event outcomes
		include traditional regression models, regularization methods,
		tree-based methods, support vector machines, neural networks,
		ensembles, data preprocessing, filtering, and model tuning and
		selection.  Performance metrics are provided for model
		assessment and can be estimated with independent test sets,
		split sampling, cross-validation, or bootstrap resampling.
		Resample estimation can be executed in parallel for faster
		processing and nested in cases of model tuning and selection.
		Modeling results can be summarized with descriptive statistics;
		calibration curves; variable importance; partial dependence
		plots; confusion matrices; and ROC, lift, and other performance
		curves.
