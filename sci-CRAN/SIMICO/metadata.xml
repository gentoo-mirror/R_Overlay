		Set-Based Inference for Multiple Interval-Censored Outcomes //
		Contains tests for association between a set of genetic
		variants and multiple correlated outcomes that are interval
		censored. Interval-censored data arises when the exact time of
		the onset of an outcome of interest is unknown but known to
		fall between two time points.
