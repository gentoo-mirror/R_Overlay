		Bayesian Smoothing of Remote Sensing Image Classification // A
		Bayesian smoothing method for post-processing of remote sensing
		image classification which refines the labelling in a
		classified image in order to enhance its classification
		accuracy. Combines pixel-based classification methods with a
		spatial post-processing method to remove outliers and
		misclassified pixels.
