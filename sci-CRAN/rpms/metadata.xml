		Recursive Partitioning for Modeling Survey Data // Functions to
		allow users to build and analyze design consistent tree and
		random forest models using survey data from a complex sample
		design.  The tree model algorithm can fit a linear model to
		survey data in each node obtained by recursively partitioning
		the data.  The splitting variables and selected splits are
		obtained using a randomized permutation test procedure which
		adjusted for complex sample design features used to obtain the
		data. Likewise the model fitting algorithm produces design-
		consistent coefficients to any specified least squares linear
		model between the dependent and independent variables used in
		the end nodes. The main functions return the resulting binary
		tree or random forest as an object of "rpms" or "rpms_forest"
		type. The package also provides methods modeling a "boosted"
		tree or forest model and a tree model for zero-inflated data as
		well as a number of functions and methods available for use
		with these object types.
