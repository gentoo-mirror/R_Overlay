		3D Volcano Plots and Polar Plots for Three-Class Data //
		Generates interactive plots for analysing and visualising
		three-class high dimensional data. It is particularly suited to
		visualising differences in continuous attributes such as
		gene/protein/biomarker expression levels between three groups.
		Differential gene/biomarker expression analysis between two
		classes is typically shown as a volcano plot. However, with
		three groups this type of visualisation is particularly
		difficult to interpret. This package generates 3D volcano plots
		and 3-way polar plots for easier interpretation of three-class
		data.
