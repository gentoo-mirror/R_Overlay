		Interactive Plotting of Three-Way Differential Expression
		Analysis // Differential expression (DE) analysis can be used
		to discover quantitative changes in expression levels between
		experimental groups. Such results are typically visualised
		using volcano plots, however in cases where more than two
		experimental groups are involved, visualising results can
		become convoluted and it quickly becomes difficult to see the
		wood for the trees. This package provides easy-to-use functions
		to extract and visualise outputs from DE between three groups
		(primarily aimed at 'limma' and 'DESeq2' outputs). We present
		novel methods to map DE results into polar coordinates to
		enable users to combine and simultaneously view three sets of
		results. These graphics also possess optional 'plotly' outputs
		for interactive and three-dimensional functionality, as seen in
		Lewis et. al. (2019) doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.091.
