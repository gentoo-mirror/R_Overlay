		Measures of Uncertainty for Model Selection // Following the
		common types of measures of uncertainty for parameter
		estimation, two measures of uncertainty were proposed for model
		selection, see Liu, Li and Jiang (2020)
		doi:10.1007/s11749-020-00737-9. The first measure is a kind of
		model confidence set that relates to the variation of model
		selection, called Mac. The second measure focuses on error of
		model selection, called LogP. They are all computed via
		bootstrapping. This package provides functions to compute these
		two measures. Furthermore, a similar model confidence set
		adapted from Bayesian Model Averaging can also be computed
		using this package.
