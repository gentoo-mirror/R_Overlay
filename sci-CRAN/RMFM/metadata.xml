		Robust Matrix Factor Model // We introduce a robust matrix factor
		model that explicitly incorporates tail behavior and employs a
		mean-shift term to avoid efficiency losses through pre-
		centering of observed matrices. More details on the methods
		related to our paper are currently under submission. A full
		reference to the paper will be provided in future versions once
		the paper is published.
