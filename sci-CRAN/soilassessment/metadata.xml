		Assessment Models for Agriculture Soil Conditions and Crop
		Suitability // Soil assessment builds information for improved
		decision in soil management. It analyzes soil conditions with
		regard to agriculture crop suitability requirements [such as
		those given by FAO https://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-
		and-software/crop-information/en/] soil fertility classes, soil
		erosion, and soil salinity classification
		[doi:10.1002/ldr.4211]. Suitability requirements are for crops
		grouped into cereal crops, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables,
		industrial crops, and root crops.
