		Assessment Models for Agriculture Soil Conditions and Crop
		Suitability // Soil assessment builds information for improved
		decision in soil management. It analyzes soil conditions with
		regard to agriculture crop suitability requirements [such as
		those given by FAO http://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-
		software/crop-information/en/] soil fertility classes, soil
		erosion models and soil salinity classification. Suitability
		requirements are for crops  grouped into cereal crops, nuts,
		legumes, fruits, vegetables, industrial crops, and root crops.
