		Concurrent Regression and History Index Models for Functional
		Data // Provides an implementation of concurrent or varying
		coefficient regression methods for functional data. The
		implementations are done for both dense and sparsely observed
		functional data. Pointwise confidence bands can be constructed
		for each case. Further, the influence of past predictor values
		are modeled by a smooth history index function, while the
		effects on the response are described by smooth varying
		coefficient functions, which are very useful in analyzing real
		data such as COVID data. References: Yao, F., Mller, H.G.,
