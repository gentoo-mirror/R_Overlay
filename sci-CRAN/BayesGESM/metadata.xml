		Bayesian Analysis of Generalized Elliptical Semi-Parametric
		Models and Flexible Measurement Error Models // Set of tools to
		perform the statistical inference based on the Bayesian
		approach for regression models under the assumption that
		independent additive errors follow normal, Student-t, slash,
		contaminated normal, Laplace or symmetric hyperbolic
		distributions, i.e., additive errors follow a scale mixtures of
		normal distributions. The regression models considered in this
		package are: (i) Generalized elliptical semi-parametric models,
		where both location and dispersion parameters of the response
		variable distribution include non-parametric additive
		components described by using B-splines; and (ii) Flexible
		measurement error models under the presence of homoscedastic
		and heteroscedastic random errors, which admit explanatory
		variables with and without measurement additive errors as well
		as the presence of a non-parametric components approximated by
		using B-splines.
