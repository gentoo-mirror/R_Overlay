		Package 'FuzzyStatTra' in Encapsulated Object Oriented
		Programming // The aim of the package is to contain the package
		'FuzzyStatTra' in Encapsulated Object Oriented Programming
		using R6. 'FuzzyStatTra' contains Statistical Methods for
		Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers, whose aim is to provide some basic
		functions for doing statistical analysis with trapezoidal fuzzy
		numbers. For more details, you can visit the website of the
		SMIRE+CoDiRE (Statistical Methods with Imprecise Random
		Elements and Comparison of Distributions of Random Elements)
		Research Group
		(https://bellman.ciencias.uniovi.es/smire+codire/). The most
		related paper can be found in References. Now, those functions
		are organized in specific classes and methods. This object-
		based approach is an important step in making statistical
		computing more accessible to users.
