		Local Control Strategy for Robust Analysis of Cross-Sectional
		Data // Especially when cross-sectional data are observational,
		effects of treatment selection bias and confounding are
		revealed by using the Nonparametric and Unsupervised
		"preprocessing" methods central to Local Control (LC) Strategy.
		The LC objective is to estimate the "effect-size distribution"
		that best quantifies a potentially causal relationship between
		a numeric y-Outcome variable and a t-Treatment or e-Exposure
		variable. Treatment variables are binary {either 1 = "new" or 0
		= "control"}, while Exposure variables vary continuously over a
		finite range. LC Strategy starts by CLUSTERING experimental
		units (individual patients, US Counties, etc.) on their
		X-confounder characteristics. Clusters represent exclusive and
		exhaustive BLOCKS of relatively well-matched units. The
		implicit statistical model for LC is thus simple one-way ANOVA.
		Within-Block measures of effect-size are Local Rank
		Correlations (LRCs) when Exposure is numeric with (many) more
		than two levels. Otherwise, Treatment choice is Nested within
		BLOCKS, and effect-sizes are LOCAL Treatment Differences (LTDs)
		between Within-Cluster y-Outcome Means ["new" minus "control"].
		An Instrumental Variable (IV) method is also provided so that
		Local Average y-Outcomes (LAOs) within BLOCKS may also
		contribute information for effect-size inferences ...assuming
		that X-Covariates influence only Treatment choice or Exposure
		level and otherwise have no direct effects on y-Outcome.
		Finally, a "Most-Like-Me" function provides histograms of
		effect-size distributions to aid Doctor-Patient or Researcher-
		Society communications about Heterogeneous Outcomes.
