		Local Control Strategy for Analysis of Cross-Sectional Data //
		Especially when cross-sectional data are observational, effects
		of treatment selection bias and confounding are revealed by
		using the unsupervised, nonparametric preprocessing methods
		central to Local Control (LC) strategy. The LC objective is to
		estimate the "effect-size distribution" that best quantifies a
		potentially causal relationship between a continuous y-Outcome
		variable and a t-Treatment variable. This t-variable may be
		either binary {1 = "new" vs 0 = "control"} or a numeric measure
		of Exposure level. LC Strategy starts by CLUSTERING
		experimental units (patients) on baseline x-Covariates, forming
		mutually exclusive and exhaustive BLOCKS of relatively well-
		matched units. The implicit statistical model for LC is thus
		simple one-way ANOVA. The Within-Block measures of effect-size
		are Local Rank Correlations (LRCs) when Exposure is numeric
		with more than two levels. Otherwise, Treatment choice is
		Nested within BLOCKS, and effect-sizes are Local Treatment
		Differences (LTDs) between within-cluster y-Outcome Means
		["new" minus "control"]. An Instrumental Variable (IV) method
		is also provided so that Local Average y-Outcomes (LAOs) within
		BLOCKS may also contribute information for effect-size
		inferences ...assuming that x-Covariates influence only
		Treatment choice or Exposure level and otherwise have no direct
		effects on y-Outcome.
