		Optimal Linear Regression // The olr function systematically
		evaluates multiple linear regression models by exhaustively
		fitting all possible combinations of independent variables
		against the specified dependent variable. It selects the model
		that yields the highest adjusted R-squared (by default) or
		R-squared, depending on user preference. In model evaluation,
		both R-squared and adjusted R-squared are key metrics:
		R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained but
		tends to increase with the addition of predictorsregardless of
		relevancepotentially leading to overfitting. Adjusted R-squared
		compensates for this by penalizing model complexity, providing
		a more balanced view of fit quality. The goal of olr is to
		identify the most suitable model that captures the underlying
		structure of the data while avoiding unnecessary complexity. By
		comparing both metrics, it offers a robust evaluation framework
		that balances predictive power with model parsimony. Example
		Analogy: Imagine a gardener trying to understand what
		influences plant growth (the dependent variable). They might
		consider variables like sunlight, watering frequency, soil
		type, and nutrients (independent variables). Instead of
		manually guessing which combination works best, the olr
		function automatically tests every possible combination of
		predictors and identifies the most effective modelbased on
		either the highest R-squared or adjusted R-squared value. This
		saves the user from trial-and-error modeling and highlights
		only the most meaningful variables for explaining the outcome.
		A Python version is also available at
		https://pypi.org/project/olr.
