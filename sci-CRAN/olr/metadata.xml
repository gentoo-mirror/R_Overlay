		Optimal Linear Regression // The optimal linear regression olr(),
		runs all the possible combinations of linear regression
		equations. The olr() returns the equation that has the greatest
		adjusted R-squared term or the greatest R-squared term.
		Essentially, the olr() returns the best fit equation out of all
		the possible equations. Complimentary functions are included
		which list all of the equations, all of the equations in
		ascending order, a function to give the user a specific model's
		summary, and the list of adjusted R-squared terms  R-squared
