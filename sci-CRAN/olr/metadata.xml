		Optimal Linear Regression // The optimal linear regression olr(),
		runs all the possible combinations of linear regression
		equations. The olr() returns the equation which has the
		greatest adjusted R-squared term or the greatest R-squared term
		based on the user's discretion. Essentially, the olr() returns
		the best fit equation out of all the possible equations.
		R-squared increases with the addition of an explanatory
		variable whether it is 'significant' or not, thus this was
		developed to eliminate that conundrum. Adjusted R-squared is
		preferred to overcome this phenomenon, but each combination
		will still produce different results and this will return the
		best one. Complimentary functions are included which list all
		of the equations, all of the equations in ascending order, a
		function to give the user a specific model's summary, and the
		list of adjusted R-squared terms  R-squared terms. A 'Python'
		version is available at: https://pypi.org/project/olr/.
