		Dynamic models for survival data // Functions to fit time-varying
		coefficient models for interval censored and right censored
		survival data. Three major approaches are implemented: 1)
		Bayesian Cox model with time-independent, time-varying or
		dynamic coefficients for right censored and interval censored
		data; 2) Spline based time-varying coefficient Cox model for
		right censored data; 3) Transformation model with time-varying
		coefficients for right censored data using estimating
		equations.
