		Dynamic Models for Survival Data // Time-varying coefficient
		models for interval censored and right censored survival data
		including 1) Bayesian Cox model with time-independent, time-
		varying or dynamic coefficients for right censored and interval
		censored data studied by Sinha et al. (1999)
		doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00585.x and Wang et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1007/s10985-013-9246-8, 2) Spline based time-varying
		coefficient Cox model for right censored data proposed by
		Perperoglou et al. (2006) doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2005.11.006, and
		3) Transformation model with time-varying coefficients for
		right censored data using estimating equations proposed by Peng
		and Huang (2007) doi:10.1093/biomet/asm058.
