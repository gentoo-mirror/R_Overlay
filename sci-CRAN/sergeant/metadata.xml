		Drill is a low-latency distributed query engine designed to
		enable data exploration and analysis on both relational and
		non-relational data stores, scaling to petabytes of data.
		Methods are provided that enable working with Apache Drill
		instances via the REST API, DBI methods and using
		'dplyr'/'dbplyr' idioms. Helper functions are included to
		facilitate using official Drill Docker images/containers.
