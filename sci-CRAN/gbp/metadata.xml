		A Bin Packing Problem Solver // Basic infrastructure and several
		algorithms for 1d-4d bin packing problem. This package provides
		a set of c-level classes and solvers for 1d-4d bin packing
		problem, and an r-level solver for 4d bin packing problem,
		which is a wrapper over the c-level 4d bin packing problem
		solver. The 4d bin packing problem solver aims to solve bin
		packing problem, a.k.a container loading problem, with an
		additional constraint on weight. Given a set of rectangular-
		shaped items, and a set of rectangular-shaped bins with weight
		limit, the solver looks for an orthogonal packing solution such
		that minimizes the number of bins and maximize volume
		utilization. Each rectangular-shaped item i = 1, .. , n is
		characterized by length l_i, depth d_i, height h_i, and weight
		w_i, and each rectangular-shaped bin j = 1, .. , m is specified
		similarly by length l_j, depth d_j, height h_j, and weight
		limit w_j. The item can be rotated into any orthogonal
		direction, and no further restrictions implied.
