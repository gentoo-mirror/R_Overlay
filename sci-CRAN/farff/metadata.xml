		A Faster 'ARFF' File Reader and Writer // Reads and writes 'ARFF'
		files. 'ARFF' (Attribute-Relation File Format) files are like
		'CSV' files, with a little bit of added meta information in a
		header and standardized NA values. They are quite often used
		for machine learning data sets and were introduced for the
		'WEKA' machine learning 'Java' toolbox. See
		https://waikato.github.io/weka-
		wiki/formats_and_processing/arff_stable/ for further info on
		'ARFF' and for http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ for more
		info on 'WEKA'. 'farff' gets rid of the 'Java' dependency that
		'RWeka' enforces, and it is at least a faster reader (for
		bigger files). It uses 'readr' as parser back-end for the data
		section of the 'ARFF' file. Consistency with 'RWeka' is tested
		on 'Github' and 'Travis CI' with hundreds of 'ARFF' files from
		'OpenML'.
