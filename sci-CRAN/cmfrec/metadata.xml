		Collective Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems //
		Collective matrix factorization (a.k.a. multi-view or multi-way
		factorization, Singh, Gordon, (2008)
		doi:10.1145/1401890.1401969) tries to approximate a matrix 'X'
		as the product of two low-dimensional matrices aided with
		secondary information matrices about rows and/or columns of 'X'
		which are also factorized using the same latent components. The
		intended usage is for recommender systems, dimensionality
		reduction, and missing value imputation. Implements extensions
		of the original model (Cortes, (2018) arXiv:1809.00366) and can
		produce different factorizations such as the weighted
		'implicit-feedback' model (Hu, Koren, Volinsky, (2008)
		doi:10.1109/ICDM.2008.22) or the enhanced model with 'implicit
		features' (Rendle, Zhang, Koren, (2019) arXiv:1905.01395), with
		or without side information. Can use gradient-based procedures
		or alternating-least squares procedures (Koren, Bell, Volinsky,
		(2009) doi:10.1109/MC.2009.263), with either a Cholesky solver,
		a faster conjugate gradient solver (Takacs, Pilaszy, Tikk,
		(2011) doi:10.1145/2043932.2043987), or a non-negative
		coordinate descent solver (Franc, Hlavac, Navara, (2005)
		doi:10.1007/11556121_50), providing efficient methods for
		sparse and dense data, and mixtures thereof. Offers alternative
		most-popular and content-based models, and implements
		functionality for cold-start recommendations and imputation of
		2D data.
