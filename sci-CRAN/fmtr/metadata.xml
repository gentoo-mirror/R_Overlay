		Easily Apply Formats to Data // Contains a set of functions that
		can be used to apply formats to data frames or vectors.  The
		package aims to provide to functionality similar to that of SAS
		formats. Formats are assigned to the format attribute on data
		frame columns.  Then when the fdata() function is called, a new
		data frame is created with the column data formatted as
		specified.  The package also contains a value() function to
		create a user-defined format, similar to a SAS user-defined
		format.
