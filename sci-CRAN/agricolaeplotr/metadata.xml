		Visualization of Design of Experiments from the 'agricolae'
		Package // Visualization of Design of Experiments from the
		'agricolae' package with 'ggplot2' framework The user provides
		an experiment design from the 'agricolae' package, calls the
		corresponding function and will receive a visualization with
		'ggplot2' based functions that are specific for each design. As
		there are many different designs, each design is tested on its
		type. The output can be modified with standard 'ggplot2'
		commands or with other packages with 'ggplot2' function
		extensions.
