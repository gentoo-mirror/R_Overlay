		Non-Negative and Sparse CCA // Two implementations of canonical
		correlation analysis (CCA) that are based on iterated
		regression. By choosing the appropriate regression algorithm
		for each data domain, it is possible to enforce sparsity, non-
		negativity or other kinds of constraints on the projection
		vectors. Multiple canonical variables are computed sequentially
		using a generalized deflation scheme, where the additional
		correlation not explained by previous variables is maximized.
		nscancor() is used to analyze paired data from two domains, and
		has the same interface as cancor() from the 'stats' package
		(plus some extra parameters). mcancor() is appropriate for
		analyzing data from three or more domains. See https://sigg-
		iten.ch/learningbits/2014/01/20/canonical-correlation-analysis-
		under-constraints/ and Sigg et al. (2007)
		doi:10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414315 for more details.
