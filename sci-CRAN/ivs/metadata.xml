		Interval Vectors // Provides a library for generic interval
		manipulations using a new interval vector class. Capabilities
		include: locating various kinds of relationships between two
		interval vectors, merging overlaps within a single interval
		vector, splitting an interval vector on its overlapping
		endpoints, and applying set theoretical operations on interval
		vectors. Many of the operations in this package were inspired
		by James Allen's interval algebra, Allen (1983)
