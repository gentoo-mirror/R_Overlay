		Query the GTEx Portal API // A convenient R interface to the
		Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Portal API. The GTEx project
		is a comprehensive public resource for studying tissue-specific
		gene expression and regulation in human tissues. Through
		systematic analysis of RNA sequencing data from 54 non-diseased
		tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, GTEx provides
		crucial insights into the relationship between genetic
		variation and gene expression. This data is accessible through
		the GTEx Portal API enabling programmatic access to human gene
		expression data. For more information on the API, see
		https://gtexportal.org/api/v2/redoc.
