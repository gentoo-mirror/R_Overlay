		Predicting Totals and Weighted Sums from Spatial Data // Performs
		predictions of totals and weighted sums, or finite population
		block kriging, on spatial data using the methods in Ver Hoef
		(2008) doi:10.1007/s10651-007-0035-y. The primary outputs are
		an estimate of the total, mean, or weighted sum in the region,
		an estimated prediction variance, and a plot of the predicted
		and observed values. This is useful primarily to users with
		ecological data that are counts or densities measured on some
		sites in a finite area of interest. Spatial prediction for the
		total count or average density in the entire region can then be
		done using the functions in this package.
