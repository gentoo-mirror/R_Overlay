		Bayesian Constrained Generalised Linear Models // Fits
		generalised partial linear regression models using a Bayesian
		approach, where shape and smoothness constraints are imposed on
		nonparametrically modelled predictors through shape-restricted
		splines, and no constraints are imposed on optional
		parametrically modelled covariates. See Meyer et al. (2011)
		doi/10.1080/10485252.2011.597852 for more details. IMPORTANT:
		before installing 'bcgam', you need to install 'Rtools'
		(Windows) or 'Xcode' (Mac OS X). These are required for the
		correct installation of 'nimble'
		(https://r-nimble.org/download).
