		Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modelling // Flexible and robust
		estimation and inference of generalised autoregressive
		conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models with covariates
		based on the results by Francq and Thieu (2018)
		doi:10.1017/S0266466617000512. Coefficients can
		straightforwardly be set to zero by omission, and quasi maximum
		likelihood methods ensure estimates are generally consistent
		and inference valid, even when the standardised innovations are
		non-normal and/or dependent over time.
