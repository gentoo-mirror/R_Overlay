		Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modelling // Flexible and robust
		estimation and inference of generalised autoregressive
		conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models with covariates
		based on the results by Francq and Thieu (2018)
		doi:10.1017/S0266466617000512. Suitable subsets of the
		coefficients can be restricted to zero during estimation, and
		quasi maximum likelihood methods ensure estimates are generally
		consistent, even when the standardised innovations are non-
		normal and/or not independent and identically distributed.
