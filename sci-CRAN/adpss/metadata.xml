		Design and Analysis of Locally or Globally Efficient Adaptive
		Designs // Provides the functions for planning and conducting a
		clinical trial with adaptive sample size determination. Maximal
		statistical efficiency will be exploited even when dramatic or
		multiple adaptations are made. Such a trial consists of
		adaptive determination of sample size at an interim analysis
		and implementation of frequentist statistical test at the
		interim and final analysis with a prefixed significance level.
		The required assumptions for the stage-wise test statistics are
		independent and stationary increments and normality.
		Predetermination of adaptation rule is not required.
