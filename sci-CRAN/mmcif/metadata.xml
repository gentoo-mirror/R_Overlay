		Mixed Multivariate Cumulative Incidence Functions // Fits the
		mixed cumulative incidence functions model suggested by
		doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxx072 which decomposes within
		cluster dependence of risk and timing. The estimation method
		supports computation in parallel using a shared memory C++
		implementation. A sandwich estimator of the covariance matrix
		is available. Natural cubic splines are used to provide a
		flexible model for the cumulative incidence functions.
