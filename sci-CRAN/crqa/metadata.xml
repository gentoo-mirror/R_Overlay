		Recurrence Quantification Analysis for Categorical and Continuous
		Time-Series // Auto, Cross and Multi-dimensional recurrence
		quantification analysis. Different methods for computing
		recurrence, cross vs. multidimensional or profile iti.e., only
		looking at the diagonal recurrent points, as well as functions
		for optimization and plotting are proposed. in-depth measures
		of the whole cross-recurrence plot, Please refer to by Coco and
		Dale (2014) doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00510 and Wallot (2018)
		doi:10.1080/00273171.2018.1512846 for further details about the
		method.
