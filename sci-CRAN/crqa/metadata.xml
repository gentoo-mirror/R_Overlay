		Unidimensional and Multidimensional Methods for Recurrence
		Quantification Analysis // Auto, Cross and Multi-dimensional
		recurrence quantification analysis. Different methods for
		computing recurrence, cross vs. multidimensional or profile
		iti.e., only looking at the diagonal recurrent points, as well
		as functions for optimization and plotting are proposed. in-
		depth measures of the whole cross-recurrence plot, Please refer
		to Coco and others (2021) doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-062, Coco and
		Dale (2014) doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00510 and Wallot (2018) doi:
		10.1080/00273171.2018.1512846 for further details about the
