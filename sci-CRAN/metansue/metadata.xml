		Meta-Analysis of Studies with Non Statistically-Significant
		Unreported Effects // Revisited version of MetaNSUE, a novel
		meta-analytic method that allows an unbiased inclusion of
		studies with Non Statistically-Significant Unreported Effects
		(NSUEs). Briefly, the method first calculates the interval
		where the unreported effects (e.g. t-values) should be
		according to the threshold of statistical significance used in
		each study. Afterwards, maximum likelihood techniques are used
		to impute the expected effect size of each study with NSUEs,
		accounting for between-study heterogeneity and potential
		covariates. Multiple imputations of the NSUEs are then randomly
		created based on the expected value, variance and statistical
		significance bounds. Finally, a restricted-maximum likelihood
		random-effects meta-analysis is separately conducted for each
		set of imputations, and estimations from these meta-analyses
		are pooled. Please read the reference in 'metansue' for details
		of the procedure.
