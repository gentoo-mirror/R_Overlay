		Meta-Analysis of Studies with Non-Statistically Significant
		Unreported Effects // Novel method to unbiasedly include
		studies with Non-statistically Significant Unreported Effects
		(NSUEs) in a meta-analysis. First, the function calculates the
		interval where the unreported effects (e.g., t-values) should
		be according to the threshold of statistical significance used
		in each study. Afterward, the method uses maximum likelihood
		techniques to impute the expected effect size of each study
		with NSUEs, accounting for between-study heterogeneity and
		potential covariates. Multiple imputations of the NSUEs are
		then randomly created based on the expected value, variance,
		and statistical significance bounds. Finally, it conducts a
		restricted-maximum likelihood random-effects meta-analysis
		separately for each set of imputations, and it performs
		estimations from these meta-analyses. Please read the reference
		in 'metansue' for details of the procedure.
