		Mapping Data for 'usmap' Package // Provides a container for data
		used by the 'usmap' package. The data used by 'usmap' has been
		extracted into this package so that the file size of the
		'usmap' package can be reduced greatly. The data in this
		package will be updated roughly once per year (plus bug fixes)
		as new shape files are provided by the US Census bureau.
