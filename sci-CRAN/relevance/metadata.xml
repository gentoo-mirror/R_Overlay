		Calculate Relevance and Significance Measures // Calculates
		relevance and significance values for simple models and for
		many types of regression models. These are introduced in
		'Stahel, Werner A.' (2021) "Measuring Significance and
		Relevance instead of p-values."
		https://stat.ethz.ch/~stahel/relevance/stahel-
		relevance2103.pdf. These notions are also applied to
		replication studies, as described in the manuscript 'Stahel,
		Werner A.' (2022) "'Replicability': Terminology, Measuring
		Success, and Strategy" available in the documentation.
