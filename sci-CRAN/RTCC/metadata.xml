		Detecting Trait Clustering in Environmental Gradients // The
		Randomized Trait Community Clustering method (Triado-Margarit
		et al., 2019, doi:10.1038/s41396-019-0454-4) is a statistical
		approach which allows to determine whether if an observed trait
		clustering pattern is related to an increasing environmental
		constrain. The method 1) determines whether exists or not a
		trait clustering on the sampled communities and 2) assess if
		the observed clustering signal is related or not to an
		increasing environmental constrain along an environmental
		gradient. Also, when the effect of the environmental gradient
		is not linear, allows to determine consistent thresholds on the
		community assembly based on trait-values.
