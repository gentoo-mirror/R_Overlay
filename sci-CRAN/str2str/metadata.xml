		Convert R Objects from One Structure to Another // Offers a suite
		of functions for converting to and from (atomic) vectors,
		matrices, data.frames, and (3D+) arrays as well as lists of
		these objects. It is an alternative to the base R
		as.str.method() functions (e.g., as.data.frame.array()) that
		provides more useful and/or flexible restructuring of R
		objects. To do so, it only works with common structuring of R
		objects (e.g., data.frames with only atomic vector columns).
