		Help for Writing Unit Tests Based on Function Examples // Take
		the examples written in your documentation of functions and use
		them to create shells (skeletons which must be manually
		completed by the user) of test files to be tested with the
		'testthat' package. Sort of like python 'doctests' for R.
