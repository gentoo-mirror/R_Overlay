		Easy Graphs for Data Visualisation and Linear Models for ANOVA //
		Easily explore data by generating different kinds of graphs
		with few lines of code. Use these ggplot() wrappers to quickly
		draw graphs of scatter/dots with box-whiskers, violins or SD
		error bars, data distributions, before-after graphs, factorial
		ANOVA and more. Customise graphs and choose from 8 colour-blind
		friendly discreet or 1 continuous colour scheme. Simple code
		for ANOVA as ordinary (lm()) or mixed-effects linear models
		(lmer()), including randomised-block or repeated-measures
		designs. Carry out post-hoc comparisons on fitted models (via
		emmeans() wrappers). Also includes small datasets for
		practicing code and teaching basics before users move on to
		more complex designs. See vignettes for details on usage
