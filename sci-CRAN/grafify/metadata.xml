		Easy Graphs for Data Visualisation and Linear Models for ANOVA //
		Easily explore data by plotting graphs with a few lines of
		code. Use these ggplot() wrappers to quickly draw graphs of
		scatter/dots with box-whiskers, violins or SD error bars, data
		distributions, before-after graphs, factorial ANOVA and more.
		Customise graphs in many ways, for example, by choosing from
		colour blind-friendly palettes (12 discreet, 3 continuous and 2
		divergent palettes). Use the simple code for ANOVA as ordinary
		(lm()) or mixed-effects linear models (lmer()), including
		randomised-block or repeated-measures designs, and fit non-
		linear outcomes as a generalised additive model (gam) using
		mgcv(). Obtain estimated marginal means and perform post-hoc
		comparisons on fitted models (via emmeans()). Also includes
		small datasets for practicing code and teaching basics before
		users move on to more complex designs. See vignettes for
		details on usage https://grafify-vignettes.netlify.app/.
