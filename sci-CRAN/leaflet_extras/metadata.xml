		Extra Functionality for 'leaflet' Package // The 'leaflet'
		JavaScript library provides many plugins some of which are
		available in the core 'leaflet' package, but there are many
		more. It is not possible to support them all in the core
		'leaflet' package. This package serves as an add-on to the
		'leaflet' package by providing extra functionality via
		'leaflet' plugins.
