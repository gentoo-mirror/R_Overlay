		C++ Header Files for Stan // The C++ header files of the Stan
		project are provided by this package, but it contains no R
		code, vignettes, or function documentation. There is a shared
		object containing part of the CVODES library, but it is not
		accessible from R. StanHeaders is only useful for developers
		who want to utilize the LinkingTo directive of their package's
		DESCRIPTION file to build on the Stan library without incurring
		unnecessary dependencies. The Stan project develops a
		probabilistic programming language that implements full or
		approximate Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo or variational methods and implements (optionally
		penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via optimization. The
		Stan library includes an advanced automatic differentiation
		scheme, templated statistical and linear algebra functions that
		can handle the automatically differentiable scalar types (and
		doubles, ints, etc.), and a parser for the Stan language. The
		'rstan' package provides user-facing R functions to parse,
		compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models.
