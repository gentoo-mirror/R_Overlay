		C++ Header Files for Stan // The C++ header files of the Stan
		project are provided by this package, but it contains little R
		code or documentation. The main reference is the vignette.
		There is a shared object containing part of the 'CVODES'
		library, but its functionality is not accessible from R.
		'StanHeaders' is only useful for developers who want to utilize
		the 'LinkingTo' directive of their package's DESCRIPTION file
		to build on the Stan library without incurring unnecessary
		dependencies. The Stan project develops a probabilistic
		programming language that implements full or approximate
		Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo or
		'variational' methods and implements (optionally penalized)
		maximum likelihood estimation via optimization. The Stan
		library includes an advanced automatic differentiation scheme,
		'templated' statistical and linear algebra functions that can
		handle the automatically 'differentiable' scalar types (and
		doubles, 'ints', etc.), and a parser for the Stan language. The
		'rstan' package provides user-facing R functions to parse,
		compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models.
