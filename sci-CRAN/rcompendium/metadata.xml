		Create a Package or Research Compendium Structure // Makes easier
		the creation of R package or research compendium (i.e. a
		predefined files/folders structure) so that users can focus on
		the code/analysis instead of wasting time organizing files. A
		full ready-to-work structure is set up with some additional
		features: version control, remote repository creation, CI/CD
		configuration (check package integrity under several OS, test
		code with 'testthat', and build and deploy website using
		'pkgdown'). This package heavily relies on the R packages
		'devtools' and 'usethis' and follows recommendations made by
		Wickham H. (2015) ISBN:9781491910597 and Marwick B. et al.
