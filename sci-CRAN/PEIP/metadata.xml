		Geophysical Inverse Theory and Optimization // Several functions
		introduced in Aster et al.'s book on inverse theory. The
		functions are often translations of MATLAB code developed by
		the authors to illustrate concepts of inverse theory as applied
		to geophysics. Generalized inversion, tomographic inversion
		algorithms (conjugate gradients, 'ART' and 'SIRT'), non-linear
		least squares, first and second order Tikhonov regularization,
		roughness constraints, and procedures for estimating smoothing
		parameters are included.
