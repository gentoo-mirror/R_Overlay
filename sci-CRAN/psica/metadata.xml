		Decision Tree Analysis for Probabilistic Subgroup Identification
		with Multiple Treatments // In the situation when multiple
		alternative treatments or interventions available, different
		population groups may respond differently to different
		treatments. This package implements a method that discovers the
		population subgroups in which a certain treatment has a better
		effect than the other alternative treatments. This is done by
		first estimating the treatment effect for a given treatment and
		its uncertainty by computing random forests, and the resulting
		model is summarized by a decision tree in which the
		probabilities that the given treatment is best for a given
		subgroup is shown in the corresponding terminal node of the
		tree.
