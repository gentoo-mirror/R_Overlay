		The Maybe Monad // The maybe type represents the possibility of
		some value or nothing. It is often used instead of throwing an
		error or returning `NULL`. The advantage of using a maybe type
		over `NULL` is that it is both composable and requires the
		developer to explicitly acknowledge the potential absence of a
		value, helping to avoid the existence of unexpected behaviour.
