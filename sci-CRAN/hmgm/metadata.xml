		High-Dimensional Mixed Graphical Models Estimation // Provides
		weighted lasso framework for high-dimensional mixed data graph
		estimation. In the graph estimation stage, the graph structure
		is estimated by maximizing the conditional likelihood of one
		variable given the rest. We focus on the conditional
		loglikelihood of each variable and fit separate regressions to
		estimate the parameters, much in the spirit of the neighborhood
		selection approach proposed by Meinshausen-Buhlmann for the
		Gaussian Graphical Model and by Ravikumar for the Ising Model.
		Currently, the discrete variables can only take two values. In
		the future, method for general discrete data and for
		visualizing the estimated graph will be added. For more
		details, see the linked paper.
