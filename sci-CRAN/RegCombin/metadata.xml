		Partially Linear Regression under Data Combination // We
		implement linear regression when the outcome of interest and
		some of the covariates are observed in two different datasets
		that cannot be linked, based on D'Haultfoeuille, Gaillac,
		Maurel (2022) doi:10.3386/w29953. The package allows for common
		regressors observed in both datasets, and for various shape
		constraints on the effect of covariates on the outcome of
		interest. It also provides the tools to perform a test of point
		identification. See the associated vignette https://github.com/
		cgaillac/RegCombin/blob/master/RegCombin_vignette.pdf for
		theory and code examples.
