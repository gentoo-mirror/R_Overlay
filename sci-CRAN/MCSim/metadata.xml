		Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters // Identifies the
		optimal number of clusters by calculating the similarity
		between two clustering methods at the same number of clusters
		using the corrected indices of Rand and Jaccard as described in
		Albatineh and Niewiadomska-Bugaj (2011). The number of clusters
		at which the index attain its maximum more frequently is a
		candidate for being the optimal number of clusters.
