		Adaptive k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier Based on Local Curvature
		Estimation // Implements the kK-NN algorithm, an adaptive
		k-nearest neighbor classifier that adjusts the neighborhood
		size based on local data curvature. The method estimates local
		Gaussian curvature by approximating the shape operator of the
		data manifold. This approach aims to improve classification
		performance, particularly in datasets with limited samples.
