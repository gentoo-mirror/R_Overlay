		Omitted Variable Tool // This tool was designed to assess the
		sensitivity of research findings to omitted variables when
		estimating causal effects using propensity score (PS)
		weighting. This tool produces graphics and summary results that
		will enable a researcher to quantify the impact an omitted
		variable would have on their results. Burgette et al. (2021)
		describe the methodology behind the primary function in this
		package, ov_sim. The method is demonstrated in Griffin et al.
