		Tools for Polyploid Microsatellite Analysis // A collection of
		tools to handle microsatellite data of any ploidy (and samples
		of mixed ploidy) where allele copy number is not known in
		partially heterozygous genotypes.  It can import and export
		data in ABI 'GeneMapper', 'Structure', 'ATetra',
		'Tetrasat'/'Tetra', 'GenoDive', 'SPAGeDi', 'POPDIST', 'STRand',
		and binary presence/absence formats.  It can calculate pairwise
		distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model
		or infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and
		allele frequencies into account.  These distances can be used
		for the calculation of clonal diversity statistics or used for
		further analysis in R.  Allelic diversity statistics are also
		available.  polysat can assist the user in estimating the
		ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele frequencies in
		populations, calculate pairwise Fst values based on those
		frequencies, and export allele frequencies to 'SPAGeDi' and
		'adegenet'.  Functions are also included for assigning alleles
		to isoloci in cases where one pair of microsatellite primers
		amplifies alleles from two or more independently segregating
		isoloci.
