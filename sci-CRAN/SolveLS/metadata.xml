		Iterative Methods for Solving Linear System of Equations //
		Solving a system of linear equations is one of the most
		fundamental computational problems for many fields of
		mathematical studies, such as regression problems from
		statistics or numerical partial differential equations. We
		provide basic stationary iterative solvers such as Jacobi,
		Gauss-Seidel, Successive Over-Relaxation and SSOR methods.
		Nonstationary, also known as Krylov subspace methods are also
		provided. Sparse matrix computation is also supported in that
		solving large and sparse linear systems can be manageable using
		'Matrix' package along with 'RcppArmadillo'. For a more
		detailed description, see a book by Saad (2003)
