		Statistical Inference on Lineup Fairness // Since the early 1970s
		eyewitness testimony researchers have recognised the importance
		of estimating properties such as lineup bias (is the lineup
		biased against the suspect, leading to a rate of choosing
		higher than one would expect by chance?), and lineup size (how
		many reasonable choices are in fact available to the witness? A
		lineup is supposed to consist of a suspect and a number of
		additional members, or foils, whom a poor-quality witness might
		mistake for the perpetrator). Lineup measures are descriptive,
		in the first instance, but since the earliest articles in the
		literature researchers have recognised the importance of
		reasoning inferentially about them. This package contains
		functions to compute various properties of laboratory or police
		lineups, and is intended for use by researchers in forensic
		psychology and/or eyewitness testimony research. Among others,
		the r4lineups package includes functions for calculating lineup
		proportion, functional size, various estimates of effective
		size, diagnosticity ratio, homogeneity of the diagnosticity
		ratio, ROC curves for confidence x accuracy data and the degree
		of similarity of faces in a lineup.
