		Software implementation of step-down and step-up Dunnett test
		procedures // For the implementation of the step-down or step-
		up Dunnett testing procedures, the package includes R functions
		to calculate critical constants and R functions to calculate
		adjusted P-values of the test statistics. In addition, the
		package also contains functions to evaluate testing powers and
		hence the necessary sample sizes specially for the classical
		problem of comparisons of several treatments with a control.
