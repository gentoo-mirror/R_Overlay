		The Composer of Plots // The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong
		API for sequentially building up a plot, but does not concern
		itself with composition of multiple plots. 'patchwork' is a
		package that expands the API to allow for arbitrarily complex
		composition of plots by, among others, providing mathematical
		operators for combining multiple plots. Other packages that try
		to address this need (but with a different approach) are
		'gridExtra' and 'cowplot'.
