		Creating and Reading Data Packages // Open, read data from and
		modify Data Packages. Data Packages are an open standard for
		bundling and describing data sets (https://datapackage.org).
		When data is read from a Data Package care is taken to convert
		the data as much a possible to R appropriate data types. The
		package can be extended with plugins for additional data types.
