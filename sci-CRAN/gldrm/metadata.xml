		Generalized Linear Density Ratio Models // Fits a generalized
		linear density ratio model (GLDRM). A GLDRM is a semiparametric
		generalized linear model. In contrast to a GLM, which assumes a
		particular exponential family distribution, the GLDRM uses a
		semiparametric likelihood to estimate the reference
		distribution. The reference distribution may be any discrete,
		continuous, or mixed exponential family distribution. The model
		parameters, which include both the regression coefficients and
		the cdf of the unspecified reference distribution, are
		estimated by maximizing a semiparametric likelihood. Regression
		coefficients are estimated with no loss of efficiency, i.e. the
		asymptotic variance is the same as if the true exponential
		family distribution were known. Huang (2014)
