		High-Dimensional Aggregate Density Forecasts // Provides a
		forecasting method that maps vast numbers of (scalar-valued)
		signals of any type into an aggregate density forecast in a
		time-varying and computationally fast manner. The method
		proceeds in two steps: First, it transforms a predictive signal
		into a density forecast. Second, it combines the generated
		candidate density forecasts into an ultimate density forecast.
		The methods are explained in detail in Adaemmer et al. (2023)
