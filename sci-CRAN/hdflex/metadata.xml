		High-Dimensional Aggregate Density Forecasts // Provides a
		forecasting method that efficiently maps vast numbers of
		(scalar-valued) signals into an aggregate density forecast in a
		time-varying and computationally fast manner. The method
		proceeds in two steps: First, it transforms a predictive signal
		into a density forecast and, second, it combines the resulting
		candidate density forecasts into an ultimate aggregate density
		forecast. For a detailed explanation of the method, please
		refer to Adaemmer et al. (2023) doi:10.2139/ssrn.4342487.
