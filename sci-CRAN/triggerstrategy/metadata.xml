		Trigger Strategy in Clinical Trials // The trigger strategy is a
		general framework for a multistage statistical design with
		multiple hypotheses, allowing an adaptive selection of interim
		analyses. The selection of interim stages can be associated
		with some prespecified endpoints which serve as the trigger.
		This selection allows us to refine the critical boundaries in
		hypotheses testing procedures, and potentially increase the
		statistical power. This package includes several trial designs
		using the trigger strategy. See Gou, J. (2023), "Trigger
		strategy in repeated tests on multiple hypotheses", Statistics
		in Biopharmaceutical Research, 15(1), 133-140, and Gou, J.
		(2022), "Sample size optimization and initial allocation of the
		significance levels in group sequential trials with multiple
		endpoints", Biometrical Journal, 64(2), 301-311.
