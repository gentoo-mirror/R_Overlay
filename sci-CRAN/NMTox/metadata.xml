		Dose-Response Relationship Analysis of Nanomaterial Toxicity //
		Perform an exploration and a preliminary analysis on the dose-
		response relationship of nanomaterial toxicity. Several
		functions are provided for data exploration, including
		functions for creating a subset of dataset, frequency tables
		and plots. Inference for order restricted dose- response data
		is performed by testing the significance of monotonic dose-
		response relationship, using Williams, Marcus, M, Modified M
		and Likelihood ratio tests. Several methods of multiplicity
		adjustment are also provided. Description of the methods can be
		found in https://github.com/rahmasarina/dose-response-
		analysis/blob/main/Methodology.pdf.
