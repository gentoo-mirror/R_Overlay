		Probabilistic Two Sample Mendelian Randomization // Efficient
		statistical inference of two-sample MR (Mendelian
		Randomization) analysis. It can account for the correlated
		instruments and the horizontal pleiotropy, and can provide the
		accurate estimates of both causal effect and horizontal
		pleiotropy effect as well as the two corresponding p-values.
		There are two main functions in the 'PPMR' package. One is
		PMR_individual() for individual level data, the other is
		PMR_summary() for summary data.
