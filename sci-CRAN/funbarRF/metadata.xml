		Fungal Species Identification using DNA Barcode with Random
		Forest // A machine learning based approach for fungal species
		identification using barcode sequence data. The multi-class
		random forest model has been used for prediction purpose, where
		the gap-pair compositional feature was used to encode the
		barcode sequence data. The encoded dataset was used as input
		for prediction purpose. Though this approach has been developed
		for fungal species identification in particular, can be used
		for other species identification as well.
