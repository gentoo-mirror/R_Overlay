		HydroBudget  Groundwater Recharge Model // HydroBudget is a
		spatially distributed groundwater recharge model that computes
		a superficial water budget on grid cells with outputs
		aggregated into monthly time steps. It was developed as an
		accessible and computationally affordable model to simulate
		groundwater recharge over large areas (thousands of km2,
		regional-scale watersheds) and for long time periods (decades),
		in cold and humid climates. Model algorithms are based on the
		research of Dubois, E. et al. (2021a) doi:10.5683/SP3/EUDV3H
		and Dubois, E. et al. (2021b) doi:10.5194/hess-25-6567-2021.
