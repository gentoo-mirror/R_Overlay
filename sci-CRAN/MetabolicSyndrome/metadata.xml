		Diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome // The modified Adult Treatment
		Panel -III guidelines (ATP-III) proposed by American Heart
		Association (AHA) and National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
		(NHLBI) are used widely for the clinical diagnosis of Metabolic
		Syndrome. The AHA-NHLBI criteria advise using parameters such
		as waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP),
		diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG),
		triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
		(HDLC) for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Each parameter has
		to be interpreted based on the proposed cut-offs, making the
		diagnosis slightly complex and error-prone. This package is
		developed by incorporating the modified ATP-III guidelines, and
		it will aid in the easy and quick diagnosis of metabolic
		syndrome in busy healthcare settings and also for research
		purposes. The modified ATP-III-AHA-NHLBI criteria for the
		diagnosis is described by Grundy et al ., (2005)
