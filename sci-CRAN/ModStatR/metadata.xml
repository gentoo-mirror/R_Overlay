		Statistical Modelling in Action with R // Datasets and functions
		for the book "Modlisation statistique par la pratique avec R",
		F. Bertrand, E. Claeys and M. Maumy-Bertrand (2019,
		ISBN:9782100793525, Dunod, Paris). The first chapter of the
		book is dedicated to an introduction to the R statistical
		software. The second chapter deals with correlation analysis:
		Pearson, Spearman and Kendall simple, multiple and partial
		correlation coefficients. New wrapper functions for permutation
		tests or bootstrap of matrices of correlation are provided with
		the package. The third chapter is dedicated to data exploration
		with factorial analyses (PCA, CA, MCA, MDA) and clustering. The
		fourth chapter is dedicated to regression analysis: fitting and
		model diagnostics are detailed. The exercises focus on
		covariance analysis, logistic regression, Poisson regression,
		two-way analysis of variance for fixed or random factors.
		Various example datasets are shipped with the package: for
		instance on pokemon, world of warcraft, house tasks or food
		nutrition analyses.
