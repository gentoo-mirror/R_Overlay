		Generalized Kernel Regularized Least Squares // Kernel
		regularized least squares, also known as kernel ridge
		regression, is a flexible machine learning method. This package
		implements this method by providing a smooth term for use with
		'mgcv' and uses random sketching to facilitate scalable
		estimation on large datasets. It provides additional functions
		for calculating marginal effects after estimation and for use
		with ensembles ('SuperLearning'), double/debiased machine
		learning ('DoubleML'), and robust/clustered standard errors
		('sandwich'). Chang and Goplerud (2024) doi:10.1017/pan.2023.27
		provide further details.
