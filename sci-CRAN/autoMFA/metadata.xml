		Algorithms for Automatically Fitting MFA Models // Provides
		methods for fitting the Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) model
		automatically. The MFA model is a mixture model where each sub-
		population is assumed to follow the Factor Analysis model. The
		Factor Analysis (FA) model is a latent variable model which
		assumes that observations are normally distributed, but imposes
		constraints on their covariance matrix. The MFA model contains
		two hyperparameters; g (the number of components in the
		mixture) and q (the number of factors in each component Factor
		Analysis model). Usually, the Expectation-Maximisation
		algorithm would be used to fit the MFA model, but this requires
		g and q to be known. This package treats g and q as unknowns
		and provides several methods which infer these values with as
		little input from the user as possible.
