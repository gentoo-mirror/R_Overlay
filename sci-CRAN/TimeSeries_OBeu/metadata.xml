		Time Series Analysis 'OpenBudgets' // Estimate and return the
		needed parameters for visualisations designed for 'OpenBudgets'
		http://openbudgets.eu/ time series data. Calculate time series
		model and forecast parameters in Budget time series data of
		municipalities across Europe, according to the 'OpenBudgets'
		data model. There are functions for measuring deterministic and
		stochastic trend of the input time series data, decomposing
		with local regression models or seasonal trend decomposition,
		modelling the appropriate auto regressive integrated moving
		average model and provide forecasts for the input 'OpenBudgets'
		time series fiscal data. Also, can be used generally to extract
		visualisation parameters convert them to 'JSON' format and use
		them as input in a different graphical interface.
