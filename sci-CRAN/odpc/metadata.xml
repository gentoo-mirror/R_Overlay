		One-Sided Dynamic Principal Components // Functions to compute
		the one-sided dynamic principal components ('odpc') introduced
		in Pea, Smucler and Yohai (2019)
		DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1520117. 'odpc' is a novel dimension
		reduction technique for multivariate time series, that is
		useful for forecasting. These dynamic principal components are
		defined as the linear combinations of the present and past
		values of the series that minimize the reconstruction mean
		squared error.
