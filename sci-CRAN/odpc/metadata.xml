		One-Sided Dynamic Principal Components // Functions to compute
		the one-sided dynamic principal components ('odpc') introduced
		in Smucler, Pea and Yohai (2017) arXiv:1708.04705. 'odpc' is a
		novel dimension reduction technique for multivariate time
		series, that is useful for forecasting. These dynamic principal
		components are defined as the linear combinations of the
		present and past values of the series that minimize the
		reconstruction mean squared error.
