		Add Nonparametric Bootstrap SE to 'glmnet' for Selected
		Coefficients (No Shrinkage) // Builds a LASSO, Ridge, or
		Elastic Net model with 'glmnet' or 'cv.glmnet' with bootstrap
		inference statistics (SE, CI, and p-value) for selected
		coefficients with no shrinkage applied for them. Model
		performance can be evaluated on test data and an automated
		alpha selection is implemented for Elastic Net. Parallelized
		computation is used to speed up the process. The methods are
		described in Friedman et al. (2010) doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01
		and Simon et al. (2011) doi:10.18637/jss.v039.i05.
