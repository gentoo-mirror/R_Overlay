		Statistical Learning with Kernel for Persistence Diagrams //
		Provides tools for exploiting topological information into
		standard statistical learning algorithms. To this aim, this
		package contains the most popular kernels defined on the space
		of persistence diagrams, and persistence images. Moreover, it
		provides a solver for kernel Support Vector Machines problems,
		whose kernels are not necessarily positive semidefinite, based
		on the C++ library 'LIBSVM'
		https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/, and on its R
		implementation 'e1071'. Additionally, it allows to compute
		Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams with an
		arbitrary ground metric, building an R interface for the C++
		library 'HERA'
		https://bitbucket.org/grey_narn/hera/src/master/.
