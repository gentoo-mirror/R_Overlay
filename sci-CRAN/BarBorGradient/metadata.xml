		Function Minimum Approximator // Tool to find where a function
		has its lowest value(minimum). The functions can be any
		dimensions. Recommended use is with eps=10^-10, but can be run
		with 10^-20, although this depends on the function. Two more
		methods are in this package, simple gradient method (Gradmod)
		and Powell method (Powell). These are not recommended for use,
		their purpose are purely for comparison.
