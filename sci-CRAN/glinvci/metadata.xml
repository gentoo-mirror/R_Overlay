		Phylogenetic Comparative Methods with Uncertainty Estimates // A
		framework for analytically computing the asymptotic confidence
		intervals and maximum-likelihood estimates of a class of
		continuous-time Gaussian branching processes defined by Mitov
		V, Bartoszek K, Asimomitis G, Stadler T (2019)
		doi:10.1016/j.tpb.2019.11.005. The class of model includes the
		widely used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Brownian motion branching
		processes. The framework is designed to be flexible enough so
		that the users can easily specify their own sub-models, or re-
		parameterizations, and obtain the maximum-likelihood estimates
		and confidence intervals of their own custom models.
