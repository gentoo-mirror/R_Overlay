		Equivalence Test for the Means of Two Normal Distributions // Two
		methods for performing equivalence test for the means of two
		(test and reference) normal distributions are implemented. The
		null hypothesis of the equivalence test is that the absolute
		difference between the two means are greater than or equal to
		the equivalence margin and the alternative is that the absolute
		difference is less than the margin. Given that the margin is
		often difficult to obtain a priori, it is assumed to be a
		constant multiple of the standard deviation of the reference
		distribution. The first method assumes a fixed margin which is
		a constant multiple of the estimated standard deviation of the
		reference data and whose variability is ignored. The second
		method takes into account the margin variability. In addition,
		some tools to summarize and illustrate the data and test
		results are included to facilitate the evaluation of the data
		and interpretation of the results.
