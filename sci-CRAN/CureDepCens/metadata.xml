		Dependent Censoring Regression Models with Cure Fraction // Cure
		dependent censoring regression models for long-term survival
		multivariate data. These models are based on extensions of the
		frailty models, capable to accommodating the cure fraction and
		the dependence between failure and censoring times, with
		Weibull and piecewise exponential marginal distributions.
		Theoretical details regarding the models implemented in the
		package can be found in Schneider et al. (2022)
