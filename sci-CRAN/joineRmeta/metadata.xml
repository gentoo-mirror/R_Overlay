		Joint Modelling for Meta-Analytic (Multi-Study) Data // Fits
		joint models of the type proposed by Henderson and colleagues
		(2000) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465, but extends to the
		multi-study, meta-analytic case. Functions for meta-analysis of
		a single longitudinal and a single  time-to-event outcome from
		multiple studies using joint models. Options to produce plots
		for multi study joint data, to pool joint model fits from 'JM'
		and 'joineR' packages in a two stage meta-analysis, and to
		model multi-study joint data in a one stage meta-analysis.
