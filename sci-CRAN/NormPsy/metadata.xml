		Normalisation of Psychometric Tests // Functions for normalizing
		psychometric test scores. The normalization aims at correcting
		the metrological properties of the psychometric tests such as
		the ceiling and floor effects and the curvilinearity (unequal
		interval scaling). Functions to compute and plot predictions in
		the natural scale of the psychometric test from the estimates
		of a linear mixed model estimated on the normalized scores are
		also provided. See Philipps et al (2014) doi:10.1159/000365637
		for details.
