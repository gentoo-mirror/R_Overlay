		Bayesian Variable Selection in High Dimensional Settings using
		Nonlocal Priors // Variable/Feature selection in high or ultra-
		high dimensional settings has gained a lot of attention
		recently specially in cancer genomic studies. This package
		provides a Bayesian approach to tackle this problem, where it
		exploits mixture of point masses at zero and nonlocal priors to
		improve the performance of variable selection and coefficient
		estimation. product moment (pMOM) and product inverse moment
		(piMOM) nonlocal priors are implemented and can be used for the
		analyses. This package performs variable selection for binary
		response and survival time response datasets which are widely
		used in biostatistic and bioinformatics community. Benefiting
		from parallel computing ability, it reports necessary outcomes
		of Bayesian variable selection such as Highest Posterior
		Probability Model (HPPM), Median Probability Model (MPM) and
		posterior inclusion probability for each of the covariates in
		the model. The option to use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is
		also part of this package that can be exploited for predictive
		power measurements in real datasets.
