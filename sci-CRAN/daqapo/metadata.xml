		Data Quality Assessment for Process-Oriented Data // Provides a
		variety of methods to identify data quality issues in process-
		oriented data, which are useful to verify data quality in a
		process mining context. Builds on the class for activity logs
		implemented in the package 'bupaR'. Methods to identify data
		quality issues either consider each activity log entry
		independently (e.g. missing values, activity duration
		outliers,...), or focus on the relation amongst several
		activity log entries (e.g. batch registrations, violations of
		the expected activity order,...).
