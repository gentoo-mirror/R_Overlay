		Simulate and Develop Streaming Processing // While streaming
		processing provides opportunities to deal with extremely large
		and ever growing data sets in (near) real time, the development
		of streaming algorithms for complex models is often cumbersome:
		the software packages that facilitate streaming processing in
		production environments do not provide statisticians with the
		simulation, estimation, and plotting tools they are used to.
		Developers of streaming algorithms would thus benefit from the
		flexibility of [R] to create, plot and compute data while
		developing streaming algorithms. Package RStorm implements a
		streaming architecture modeled on Storm for easy development
		and testing of streaming algorithms in [R]. RStorm is not
		intended as a production package, but rather a development tool
		for streaming algorithms.
