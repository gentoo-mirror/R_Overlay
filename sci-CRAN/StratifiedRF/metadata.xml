		Builds Trees by Sampling Variables from Groups // Random Forest
		that works with groups of predictor variables. When building a
		tree, a number of variables is taken randomly from each group
		separately, thus ensuring that it contains variables from each
		group. Useful when rows contain information about different
		things (e.g. user information and product information) and it's
		not sensible to make a prediction with information from only
		one group of variables, or when there are far more variables
		from one group than the other and it's desired to have groups
		appear evenly on trees. Trees are grown using the C5.0
		algorithm. Currently works for classification only.
