		Builds Trees by Sampling Variables in Groups // Random Forest-
		like tree ensemble that works with groups of predictor
		variables. When building a tree, a number of variables is taken
		randomly from each group separately, thus ensuring that it
		considers variables from each group for the splits. Useful when
		rows contain information about different things (e.g. user
		information and product information) and it's not sensible to
		make a prediction with information from only one group of
		variables, or when there are far more variables from one group
		than the other and it's desired to have groups appear evenly on
		trees. Trees are grown using the C5.0 algorithm rather than the
		usual CART algorithm. Supports parallelization (multithreaded),
		missing values in predictors, and categorical variables
		(without doing One-Hot encoding in the processing). Can also be
		used to create a regular (non-stratified) Random Forest-like
		model, but made up of C5.0 trees and with some additional
		control options. As it's built with C5.0 trees, it works only
		for classification (not for regression).
