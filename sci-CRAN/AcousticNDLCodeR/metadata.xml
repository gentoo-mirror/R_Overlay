		Coding Sound Files for Use with NDL // Make acoustic cues to use
		with the R packages 'ndl' or 'ndl2'. The package implements
		functions used in the PLoS ONE paper: Denis Arnold, Fabian
		Tomaschek, Konstantin Sering, Florence Lopez, and R. Harald
		Baayen (2017). Words from spontaneous conversational speech can
		be recognized with human-like accuracy by an error-driven
		learning algorithm that discriminates between meanings straight
		from smart acoustic features, bypassing the phoneme as
		recognition unit.  PLoS ONE 12(4):e0174623
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0174623 More details can be found in
		the paper and the supplement. 'ndl' is available on CRAN.
		'ndl2' is available by request from konstantin.sering@uni-
		tuebingen.de.
