		Fits a Model that Partitions the Covariate Space into Blocks in a
		Data- Adaptive Way // Implements convex regression with
		interpretable sharp partitions (CRISP), which considers the
		problem of predicting an outcome variable on the basis of two
		covariates, using an interpretable yet non-additive model.
		CRISP partitions the covariate space into blocks in a data-
		adaptive way, and fits a mean model within each block. Unlike
		other partitioning methods, CRISP is fit using a non-greedy
		approach by solving a convex optimization problem, resulting in
		low-variance fits. More details are provided in Petersen, A.,
		Simon, N., and Witten, D. (2016). Convex Regression with
		Interpretable Sharp Partitions. Journal of Machine Learning
		Research, 17(94): 1-31
