		Manipulation Testing Based on Density Discontinuity // Density
		discontinuity testing (a.k.a. manipulation testing) is commonly
		employed in regression discontinuity designs and other program
		evaluation settings to detect perfect self-selection
		(manipulation) around a cutoff where treatment/policy
		assignment changes. This package implements manipulation
		testing procedures using the local polynomial density
		estimators: rddensity() to construct test statistics and
		p-values given a prespecified cutoff, rdbwdensity() to perform
		data-driven bandwidth selection, and rdplotdensity() to
		construct density plots.
