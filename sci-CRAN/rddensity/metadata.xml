		Manipulation Testing Based on Density Discontinuity // Density
		discontinuity test (a.k.a. manipulation test) is commonly
		employed in regression discontinuity designs and other
		treatment effect settings to detect whether there is evidence
		suggesting perfect self-selection (manipulation) around a
		cutoff where a treatment/policy assignment changes. This
		package provides tools for conducting the aforementioned
		statistical test: rddensity() to construct local polynomial
		based density discontinuity test given a prespecified cutoff,
		rdbwdensity() to perform bandwidth selection, and
		rdplotdensity() to construct density plot near the cutoff.
