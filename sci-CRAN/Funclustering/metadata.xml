		Functional Data Clustering // This package proposes a model-based
		clustering algorithm for multivariate functional data. The
		parametric mixture model, based on the assumption of normality
		of the principal components resulting from a multivariate
		functional PCA, is estimated by an EM-like algorithm. The main
		advantage of the proposed algorithm is its ability to take into
		account the dependence among curves.
