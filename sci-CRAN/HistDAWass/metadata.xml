		Histogram-Valued Data Analysis // In the framework of Symbolic
		Data Analysis, a relatively new approach to the statistical
		analysis of multi-valued data, we consider histogram-valued
		data, i.e., data described by univariate histograms. The
		methods and the basic statistics for histogram-valued data are
		mainly based on the L2 Wasserstein metric between
		distributions, i.e., the Euclidean metric between quantile
		functions. The package contains unsupervised classification
		techniques, least square regression and tools for histogram-
		valued data and for histogram time series. An introducing paper
		is Irpino A. Verde R. (2015) \doi{10.1007/s11634-014-0176-4}.
