		Causal Decomposition Analysis // We implement causal
		decomposition analysis using the methods proposed by Park, Lee,
		and Qin (2020) arXiv:2008.12812 and Park, Kang, and Lee
		(2021+). This package allows researchers to use the multiple-
		mediator-imputation, single-mediator-imputation, and product-
		of-coefficients regression methods to estimate the initial
		disparity, disparity reduction, and disparity remaining. It
		also allows to make the inference conditional on baseline
		covariates.
