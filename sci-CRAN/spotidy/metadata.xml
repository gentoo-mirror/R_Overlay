		Providing Convenience Functions to Connect R with the Spotify API
		// Providing convenience functions to connect R with the
		'Spotify' application programming interface ('API'). At first
		it aims to help setting up the OAuth2.0 Authentication flow.
		The default output of the get_*() functions is tidy, but
		optionally the functions could return the raw response from the
		'API' as well. The search_*() and get_*() functions can be
		combined. See the vignette for more information and examples
		and the official Spotify for Developers website
		https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ for
		information about the Web 'API'.
