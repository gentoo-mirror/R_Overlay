		Inference for Released Plug-in Sampling Single Synthetic Dataset
		// Considering the singly imputed synthetic data generated via
		plug-in sampling under the multivariate normal model, draws
		inference procedures including the generalized variance, the
		sphericity test, the test for independence between two subsets
		of variables, and the test for the regression of one set of
		variables on the other. For more details see Klein et al.
