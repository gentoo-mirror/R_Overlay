		Optimal Two-Period Multiarm Platform Design with New Experimental
		Arms Added During the Trial // Design parameters of the optimal
		two-period multiarm platform design (controlling for either
		family-wise error rate or pair-wise error rate) can be
		calculated using this package, allowing pre-planned deferred
		arms to be added during the trial. More details about the
		design method can be found in the paper: Pan, H., Yuan, X. and
		Ye, J. (2022) "An optimal two-period multiarm platform design
		with new experimental arms added during the trial". Manuscript
		submitted for publication. For additional references: Dunnett,
		C. W. (1955) doi:10.2307/2281208.
