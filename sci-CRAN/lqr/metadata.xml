		Robust Linear Quantile Regression // It fits a robust linear
		quantile regression model using a new family of zero-quantile
		distributions for the error term. Missing values and censored
		observations can be handled as well. This family of
		distribution includes skewed versions of the Normal, Student's
		t, Laplace, Slash and Contaminated Normal distribution. It also
		performs logistic quantile regression for bounded responses as
		shown in Galarza et.al.(2020) doi:10.1007/s13571-020-00231-0.
		It provides estimates and full inference. It also provides
		envelopes plots for assessing the fit and confidences bands
		when several quantiles are provided simultaneously.
