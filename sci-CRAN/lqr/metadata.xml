		Robust Linear Quantile Regression // It fits a robust linear
		quantile regression model using a new family of zero-quantile
		distributions for the error term. This family of distribution
		includes skewed versions of the Normal, Student's t, Laplace,
		Slash and Contaminated Normal distribution. It also performs
		logistic quantile regression for bounded responses as shown in
		Bottai et.al.(2009) doi:10.1002/sim.3781. It provides estimates
		and full inference. It also provides envelopes plots for
		assessing the fit and confidences bands when several quantiles
		are provided simultaneously.
