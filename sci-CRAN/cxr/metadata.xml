		A Toolbox for Modelling Species Coexistence in R // Recent
		developments in modern coexistence theory have advanced our
		understanding on how species are able to persist and co-occur
		with other species at varying abundances. However, applying
		this mathematical framework to empirical data is still
		challenging, precluding a larger adoption of the theoretical
		tools developed by empiricists. This package provides a
		complete toolbox for modelling interaction effects between
		species, and calculate fitness and niche differences.  The
		functions are flexible, may accept covariates, and different
		fitting algorithms can be used.  A full description of the
		underlying methods is available in Garca-Callejas, D., Godoy,
		O., and Bartomeus, I. (2020) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13443.
		Furthermore, the package provides a series of functions to
		calculate dynamics for stage-structured populations across
		sites.
