		Open Source Geometry Engine ('GEOS') C API // Provides the Open
		Source Geometry Engine ('GEOS') as a C API that can be used to
		write high-performance C and C++ geometry operations using R as
		an interface. Headers are provided to make linking to and using
		these functions from C++ code as easy and as safe as possible.
		If a suitable version of 'GEOS' is not available, an internal
		version of 'GEOS' will be built and used.
