		Independent Components Analysis Techniques for Functional Data //
		Performs smoothed (and non-smoothed) principal/independent
		components analysis of functional data. Various functional pre-
		whitening approaches are implemented as discussed in Vidal and
		Aguilera (2022) Novel whitening approaches in functional
		settings", doi:10.1002/sta4.516. Further whitening
		representations of functional data can be derived in terms of a
		few principal components, providing an avenue to explore hidden
		structures in low dimensional settings: see Vidal, Rosso and
		Aguilera (2021) Bi-smoothed functional independent component
		analysis for EEG artifact removal, doi:10.3390/math9111243.
