		The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) Method
		for Dimensionality Reduction // An implementation of the
		Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection dimensionality
		reduction by McInnes et al. (2018)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1802.03426. It also provides means to
		transform new data and to carry out supervised dimensionality
		reduction. An implementation of the related LargeVis method of
		Tang et al. (2016) doi:10.48550/arXiv.1602.00370 is also
		provided. This is a complete re-implementation in R (and C++,
		via the 'Rcpp' package): no Python installation is required.
		See the uwot website (https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot) for
		more documentation and examples.
