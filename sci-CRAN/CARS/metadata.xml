		Covariate Assisted Ranking and Screening for Large-Scale Two-
		Sample Inference // It implements the CARS procedure, which is
		a two-sample multiple testing procedure that utilizes an
		additional auxiliary variable to capture the sparsity
		information, hence improving power. The CARS procedure is shown
		to be asymptotically valid and optimal for FDR control. For
		more information, please see the website http://www-
		bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/Papers/CARS.html and the accompanying
		paper.
