		Easily Install and Load the 'Futureverse' // The 'Futureverse' is
		a set of packages for parallel and distributed process with the
		'future' package at its core, cf. Bengtsson (2021)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048. This package is designed to make it
		easy to install and load multiple 'Futureverse' packages in a
		single step. This package is intended for end-users,
		interactive use, and R scripts. Packages must not list it as a
		dependency - instead, explicitly declare each 'Futureverse'
		package as a dependency as needed.
