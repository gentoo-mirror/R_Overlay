		'Rcpp'-Based Helper Functions to Pass 'Int64' and 'nanotime'
		Values Between 'R' and 'C++' // 'Int64' values can be created
		and accessed via the 'bit64' package and its 'integer64' class
		which package the 'int64' representation cleverly into a
		'double'. The 'nanotime' packages builds on this to support
		nanosecond-resolution timestamps. This packages helps
		conversions between 'R' and 'C++' via several helper functions
		provided via a single header file.  A complete example client
		package is included as an illustration.
