		Group Sorted L1 Penalized Estimation // Group SLOPE (Group Sorted
		L1 Penalized Estimation) is a penalized linear regression
		method that is used for adaptive selection of groups of
		significant predictors in a high-dimensional linear model. The
		Group SLOPE method can control the (group) false discovery rate
		at a user-specified level (i.e., control the expected
		proportion of irrelevant among all selected groups of
		predictors). For additional information about the implemented
		methods please see Brzyski, Gossmann, Su, Bogdan (2018)
