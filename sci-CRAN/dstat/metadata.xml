		Conditional Sensitivity Analysis for Matched Observational
		Studies // A d-statistic tests the null hypothesis of no
		treatment effect in a matched, nonrandomized study of the
		effects caused by treatments.  A d-statistic focuses on subsets
		of matched pairs that demonstrate insensitivity to unmeasured
		bias in such an observational study, correcting for double-use
		of the data by conditional inference. This conditional
		inference can, in favorable circumstances, substantially
		increase the power of a sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum (2010)
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1213-8_14).  There are two examples, one
		concerning unemployment from Lalive et al. (2006)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-937X.2006.00406.x, the other concerning
		smoking and periodontal disease from Rosenbaum (2017)
		doi:10.1214/17-STS621.
