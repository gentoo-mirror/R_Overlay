		Optimum Threshold Estimation // Functions that provide point and
		interval estimations of optimum thresholds for continuous
		diagnostic tests. The methodology used is based on minimizing
		an overall cost function in the two- and three-state settings.
		We also provide functions for sample size determination and
		estimation of diagnostic accuracy measures. We also include
		graphical tools. The statistical methodology used here can be
		found in Perez-Jaume et al (2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v082.i04.
