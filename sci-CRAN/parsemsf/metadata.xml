		Parse ThermoFisher MSF Files and Estimate Protein Abundances //
		Provides functions for parsing ThermoFisher MSF files produced
		by Proteome Discoverer 1.4.x (see https://thermofisher.com for
		more information). This package makes it easy to view
		individual peptide information, including peak areas, and to
		map peptides to locations within the parent protein sequence.
		This package also estimates protein abundances from peak areas
		and across multiple technical replicates. The author of this
		package is not affiliated with ThermoFisher Scientific in any
		way.
