		Hierarchical Multinomial Processing Tree Modeling // User-
		friendly analysis of hierarchical multinomial processing tree
		(MPT) models that are often used in cognitive psychology.
		Implements the latent-trait MPT approach (Klauer, 2010)
		DOI:10.1007/s11336-009-9141-0 and the beta-MPT approach (Smith
		Batchelder, 2010) DOI:10.1016/j.jmp.2009.06.007 to model
		heterogeneity of participants. MPT models are conveniently
		specified by an .eqn-file as used by other MPT software and
		data are provided by a .csv-file or directly in R. Models are
		either fitted by calling JAGS or by an MPT-tailored Gibbs
		sampler in C++ (only for nonhierarchical and beta MPT models).
		Provides tests of heterogeneity and MPT-tailored summaries and
		plotting functions. A detailed documentation is available in
		Heck, Arnold,  Arnold (2018) DOI:10.3758/s13428-017-0869-7 and
		a tutorial on MPT modeling can be found in Schmidt, Erdfelder,
		Heck (2023) DOI:10.1037/met0000561.
