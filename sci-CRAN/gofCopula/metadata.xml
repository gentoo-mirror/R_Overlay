		Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae // Several Goodness-of-Fit
		(GoF) tests for Copulae are provided. A new hybrid test, Zhang
		et al. (2016) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.02.017 is implemented
		which supports all of the individual tests in the package, e.g.
		Genest et al. (2009) doi:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2007.10.005.
		Estimation methods for the margins are provided and all the
		tests support parameter estimation and predefined values. The
		parameters are estimated by pseudo maximum likelihood but if it
		fails the estimation switches automatically to inversion of
		Kendall's tau. For reproducibility of results, the functions
		support the definition of seeds. Also all the tests support
		automatized parallelization of the bootstrapping tasks. The
		package provides an interface to perform new GoF tests by
		submitting the test statistic.
