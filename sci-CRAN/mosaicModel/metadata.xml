		An Interface to Statistical Modeling Independent of Model
		Architecture // Provides functions for evaluating, displaying,
		and interpreting statistical models. The goal is to abstract
		the operations on models from the particular architecture of
		the model. For instance, calculating effect sizes rather than
		looking at coefficients. The package includes interfaces to
		both regression and classification architectures, including
		lm(), glm(), rlm() in 'MASS', random forests and recursive
		partitioning, k-nearest neighbors, linear and quadratic
		discriminant analysis, and models produced by the 'caret'
		package's train(). It's straightforward to add in other other
		model architectures.
