		Learning to Rank Bagging Workflows with Metalearning // A
		framework for automated machine learning. Concretely, the focus
		is on the optimisation of bagging workflows. A bagging
		workflows is composed by three phases: (i) generation: which
		and how many predictive models to learn; (ii) pruning: after
		learning a set of models, the worst ones are cut off from the
		ensemble; and (iii) integration: how the models are combined
		for predicting a new observation. autoBagging optimises these
		processes by combining metalearning and a learning to rank
		approach to learn from metadata. It automatically ranks 63
		bagging workflows by exploiting past performance and dataset
		characterization. A complete description of the method can be
		found in: Pinto, F., Cerqueira, V., Soares, C., Mendes-Moreira,
		J. (2017): "autoBagging: Learning to Rank Bagging Workflows
		with Metalearning" arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.09367.
