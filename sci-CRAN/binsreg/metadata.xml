		Binscatter Estimation and Inference // Provides tools for
		statistical analysis using the binscatter methods developed by
		Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2021a) arXiv:1902.09608 and
		Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2021b) arXiv:1902.09615.
		Binscatter provides a flexible way of describing the
		relationship between two variables based on
		partitioning/binning of the independent variable of interest.
		binsreg(), binsqreg() and binsglm() implement binscatter least
		squares regression, quantile regression and generalized linear
		regression respectively, with particular focus on constructing
		binned scatter plots. They also implement robust (pointwise and
		uniform) inference of regression functions and derivatives
		thereof. binstest() implements hypothesis testing procedures
		for parametric functional forms of and nonparametric shape
		restrictions on the regression function. binspwc() implements
		hypothesis testing procedures for pairwise group comparison of
		binscatter estimators. binsregselect() implements data-driven
		procedures for selecting the number of bins for binscatter
		estimation. All the commands allow for covariate adjustment,
		smoothness restrictions and clustering.
