		Improved Access for Blind Users // Blind users do not have access
		to the graphical output from R without printing the content of
		graph windows to an embosser of some kind. This is not as
		immediate as is required for efficient access to statistical
		output. The functions here are created so that blind people can
		make even better use of R.
