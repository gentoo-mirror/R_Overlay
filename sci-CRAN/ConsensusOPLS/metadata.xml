		Consensus OPLS for Multi-Block Data Fusion // Merging data from
		multiple sources is a relevant approach for comprehensively
		evaluating complex systems. However, the inherent problems
		encountered when analyzing single tables are amplified with the
		generation of multi-block datasets, and finding the
		relationships between data layers of increasing complexity
		constitutes a challenging task. For that purpose, a generic
		methodology is proposed by combining the strengths of
		established data analysis strategies, i.e. multi-block
		approaches and the Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS)
		framework to provide an efficient tool for the fusion of data
		obtained from multiple sources. The package enables quick and
		efficient implementation of the consensus OPLS model for any
		horizontal multi-block data structure (observation-based
		matching). Moreover, it offers an interesting range of metrics
		and graphics to help to determine the optimal number of
		components and check the validity of the model through
		permutation tests. Interpretation tools include scores and
		loadings plots, as well as Variable Importance in Projection
		(VIP), and performance coefficients such as R2, Q2 and DQ2
		coefficients. J. Boccard and D.N. Rutledge (2013)
