		A Multivariate Meta-Analysis Model for High-Dimensional
		Metabolomics Data // Performs multivariate meta-analysis for
		high-dimensional metabolomics data for integrating and
		collectively analysing individual-level data generated from
		multiple studies as well as for combining summary estimates.
		This approach accounts for correlation between outcomes,
		considers variability within and between studies, handles
		missing values and uses shrinkage estimation to allow for high
		dimensionality. A detailed vignette with example datasets and
		code to prepare data and analyses are available on
		https://bookdown.org/a2delivera/MetaHD/.
