		A Multivariate Meta-Analysis Model for Metabolomics Data //
		Performs multivariate meta-analysis for high-dimensional
		metabolomics data for integrating and collectively analysing
		individual-level metabolomics data generated from multiple
		studies as well as for combining summary estimates. This
		approach accounts for correlation between metabolites,
		considers variability within and between studies, handles
		missing values and uses shrinkage estimation to allow for high
		dimensionality. A detailed vignette with example datasets and
		code to prepare data and analyses are available on
		https://bookdown.org/a2delivera/MetaHD/.
