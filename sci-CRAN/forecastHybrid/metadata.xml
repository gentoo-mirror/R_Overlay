		Convenient Functions for Ensemble Time Series Forecasts //
		Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
		approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated
		from auto.arima(), ets(), thetaf(), nnetar(), stlm(), tbats(),
		snaive() and arfima() can be combined with equal weights,
		weights based on in-sample errors (introduced by Bates  Granger
		(1969) doi:10.1057/jors.1969.103), or cross-validated weights.
		Cross validation for time series data with user-supplied models
		and forecasting functions is also supported to evaluate model
		accuracy.
