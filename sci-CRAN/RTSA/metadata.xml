		'Trial Sequential Analysis' for Error Control and Inference in
		Sequential Meta-Analyses // Frequentist sequential meta-
		analysis based on 'Trial Sequential Analysis' (TSA) in
		programmed in Java by the Copenhagen Trial Unit (CTU). The
		primary function is the calculation of group sequential designs
		for meta-analysis to be used for planning and analysis of both
		prospective and retrospective sequential meta-analyses to
		preserve type-I-error control under sequential testing. 'RTSA'
		includes tools for sample size and trial size calculation for
		meta-analysis and core meta-analyses methods such as fixed-
		effect and random-effects models and forest plots. TSA is
		described in Wetterslev et. al (2008)
		doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2007.03.013. The methods for deriving
		the group sequential designs are based on Jennison and Turnbull
		(1999, ISBN:9780849303166).
