		Stochastic Simulation of Streamflow Time Series using Phase
		Randomization // Provides a simulation framework to simulate
		streamflow time series with similar main characteristics as
		observed data. These characteristics include the distribution
		of daily streamflow values and their temporal correlation as
		expressed by short- and long-range dependence. The approach is
		based on the randomization of the phases of the Fourier
		transform or the phases of the wavelet transform. The function
		prsim() is applicable to single site simulation and uses the
		Fourier transform. The function prsim.wave() extends the
		approach to multiple sites and is based on the complex wavelet
		transform. The function prsim.weather() extends the approach to
		multiple variables for weather generation. We further use the
		flexible four-parameter Kappa distribution, which allows for
		the extrapolation to yet unobserved low and high flows.
		Alternatively, the empirical or any other distribution can be
		used. A detailed description of the simulation approach for
		single sites and an application example can be found in Brunner
		et al. (2019) doi:10.5194/hess-23-3175-2019. A detailed
		description and evaluation of the wavelet-based multi-site
		approach can be found in Brunner and Gilleland (2020)
		doi:10.5194/hess-24-3967-2020. A detailed description and
		evaluation of the multi-variable and multi-site weather
		generator can be found in Brunner et al. (2021)
		doi:10.5194/esd-12-621-2021.
