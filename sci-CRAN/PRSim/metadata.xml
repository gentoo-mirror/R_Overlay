		Stochastic Simulation of Streamflow Time Series using Phase
		Randomization // Provides a simulation framework to simulate
		streamflow time series with similar main characteristics as
		observed data. These characteristics include the distribution
		of daily streamflow values and their temporal correlation as
		expressed by short- and long-range dependence. The approach is
		based on the randomization of the phases of the Fourier
		transform or the phases of the wavelet transform. The function
		prsim() is applicable to single site simulation and uses the
		Fourier transform. The function prsim.wave() extends the
		approach to multiple sites and is based on the complex wavelet
		transform. We further use the flexible four-parameter Kappa
		distribution, which allows for the extrapolation to yet
		unobserved low and high flows. Alternatively, the empirical or
		any other distribution can be used. A detailed description of
		the simulation approach for single sites and an application
		example can be found in https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-
		sci.net/23/3175/2019/. A detailed description and evaluation of
		the wavelet-based multi-site approach can be found in
		https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2019-658/.
