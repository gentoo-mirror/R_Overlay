		Multi-Fidelity Computer Experiments Using the Tuo-Wu-Yu Model //
		This R function implements the nonstationary Kriging model
		proposed by Tuo, Wu and Yu (2014)
		DOI:10.1080/00401706.2013.842935 for analyzing multi-fidelity
		computer outputs. This function computes the maximum likelihood
		estimates for the model parameters as well as the predictive
		means and variances of the exact solution (i.e., the
		conceptually highest fidelity).
