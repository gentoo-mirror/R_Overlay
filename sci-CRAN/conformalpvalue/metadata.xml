		Computes Conformal p-Values // Computes marginal conformal
		p-values using conformal prediction in binary classification
		tasks. Conformal prediction is a framework that augments
		machine learning algorithms with a measure of uncertainty, in
		the form of prediction regions that attain a user-specified
		level of confidence. This package specifically focuses on
		providing conformal p-values that can be used to assess the
		confidence of the classification predictions. For more details,
		see Tyagi and Guo (2023)
