		Collection of Datasets for the USGS-INL Monitoring Networks // A
		collection of analysis-ready datasets for the U.S. Geological
		Survey - Idaho National Laboratory (USGS-INL) groundwater and
		surface-water monitoring networks, administered by the USGS-INL
		Project Office in cooperation with the U.S. Department of
		Energy. The data collected from wells and surface-water
		stations at the Idaho National Laboratory and surrounding areas
		have been used to describe the effects of waste disposal on
		water contained in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer,
		located in the southeastern part of Idaho, and the availability
		of water for long-term consumptive and industrial use. The
		package includes long-term monitoring records dating back to
		measurements from 1922. Geospatial data describing the areas
		from which samples were collected or observations were made are
		also included in the package. Bundling this data into a single
		package significantly reduces the magnitude of data processing
		for researchers and provides a way to distribute the data along
		with its documentation in a standard format. Geospatial
		datasets are made available in a common projection and datum,
		and geohydrologic data have been structured to facilitate
		analysis.
