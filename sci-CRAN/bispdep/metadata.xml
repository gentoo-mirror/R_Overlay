		Statistical Tools for Bivariate Spatial Dependence Analysis // A
		collection of functions to test spatial autocorrelation between
		variables, including Moran I, Geary C and Getis G together with
		scatter plots, functions for mapping and identifying clusters
		and outliers, functions associated with the moments of the
		previous statistics that will allow testing whether there is
		bivariate spatial autocorrelation, and a function that allows
		identifying (visualizing neighbours) on the map, the neighbors
		of any region once the scheme of the spatial weights matrix has
		been established.
