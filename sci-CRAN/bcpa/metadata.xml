		Behavioral Change Point Analysis of Animal Movement // The
		Behavioral Change Point Analysis (BCPA) is a method of
		identifying hidden shifts in the underlying parameters of a
		time series, developed specifically to be applied to animal
		movement data which is irregularly sampled.  The method is
		based on: E. Gurarie, R. Andrews and K. Laidre A novel method
		for identifying behavioural changes in animal movement data
		(2009) Ecology Letters 12:5 395-408. A development version is
		on https://github.com/EliGurarie/bcpa. NOTE: the BCPA method
		may be useful for any univariate, irregularly sampled Gaussian
		time-series, but animal movement analysts are encouraged to
		apply correlated velocity change point analysis as implemented
		in the smoove package, as of this writing on GitHub at
		https://github.com/EliGurarie/smoove. An example of a
		univariate analysis is provided in the UnivariateBCPA vignette.
