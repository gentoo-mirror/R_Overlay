		Bayesian Integrative Models of Trait Evolution // Contains the
		JIVE (joint inter and intra-specific model of variance
		evolution) model and other Bayesian models aimed at
		understanding trait evolution. The goal of the package is to
		join phylogenetic comparative models (PCM) that tend to
		integrate various type of data (individual observations,
		environmental data, fossil data) into a hierarchical Bayesian
		framework. It contains various PCMs as well as functions to
		join those models into a hierarchical Bayesian framework in a
		flexible and user friendly way. It contains various Markov
		chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, methods for model
		comparison and many plotting function for pre- and post-
		processing data visualization. Finally, this package integrates
		functions allowing bridges between 'R' and the 'BEAST2'
		implementations of PCMs. Kostikova A, Silvestro D, Pearman PB,
