		Including Known Interactions in Species Distribution Models // A
		collection of tools to fit and work with trophic Species
		Distribution Models. Trophic Species Distribution Models
		combine knowledge of trophic interactions with Bayesian
		structural equation models that model each species as a
		function of its prey (or predators) and environmental
		conditions. It exploits the topological ordering of the known
		trophic interaction network to predict species distribution in
		space and/or time, where the prey (or predator) distribution is
		unavailable. The method implemented by the package is described
		in Poggiato, Androletti, Pollock and Thuiller (2022)
