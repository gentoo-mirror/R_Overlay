		Estimate User-Based Tagging Mortality and Tag Loss in Mark-
		Recapture Studies // We provide several avenues to predict and
		account for user-based mortality and tag loss during mark-
		recapture studies. When planning a study on a target species,
		the retentionmort_generation() function can be used to produce
		multiple synthetic mark-recapture datasets to anticipate the
		error associated with a planned field study to guide method
		development to reduce error. Similarly, if field data was
		already collected, the retentionmort() function can be used to
		predict the error from already generated data to adjust for
		user-based mortality and tag loss. The
		test_dataset_retentionmort() function will provide an example
		dataset of how data should be inputted into the function to run
		properly. Lastly, the retentionmort_figure() function can be
		used on any dataset generated from either model function to
		produce an 'rmarkdown' printout of preliminary analysis
		associated with the model, including summary statistics and
		figures. Methods and results pertaining to the formation of
		this package can be found in McCutcheon et al. (in review,
		"Predicting tagging-related mortality and tag loss during mark-
		recapture studies").
