		R Interface to Proximal Interior Point Quadratic Programming
		Solver // An embedded proximal interior point quadratic
		programming solver, which can solve dense and sparse quadratic
		programs, described in Schwan, Jiang, Kuhn, and Jones (2023)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2304.00290. Combining an infeasible interior
		point method with the proximal method of multipliers, the
		algorithm can handle ill-conditioned convex quadratic
		programming problems without the need for linear independence
		of the constraints. The solver is written in header only 'C++
		14' leveraging the 'Eigen' library for vectorized linear
		algebra. For small dense problems, vectorized instructions and
		cache locality can be exploited more efficiently. Allocation
		free problem updates and re-solves are also provided.
