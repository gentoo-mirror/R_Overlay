		Joint Modelling of Multivariate Longitudinal Data and Time-to-
		Event Outcomes // Fits the joint model proposed by Henderson
		and colleagues (2000) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465, but
		extended to the case of multiple continuous longitudinal
		measures. The time-to-event data is modelled using a Cox
		proportional hazards regression model with time-varying
		covariates. The multiple longitudinal outcomes are modelled
		using a multivariate version of the Laird and Ware linear mixed
		model. The association is captured by a multivariate latent
		Gaussian process. The model is estimated using a Monte Carlo
		Expectation Maximization algorithm. This project is funded by
		the Medical Research Council (Grant number MR/M013227/1).
