		FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) Utilities // Utilities to
		read and write files in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport
		System) format, a standard format in astronomy (see e.g.
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS for more information).
		Present low-level routines allow: reading, parsing, and
		modifying FITS headers; reading FITS images (multi-dimensional
		arrays); reading FITS binary and ASCII tables; and writing FITS
		images (multi-dimensional arrays).  Higher-level functions
		allow: reading files composed of one or more headers and a
		single (perhaps multidimensional) image or single table;
		reading tables into data frames; generating vectors for image
		array axes; scaling and writing images as 16-bit integers.
		Known incompletenesses are reading random group extensions, as
		well as complex and array descriptor data types in binary
		tables.
