		Fast Conversion of R Colors to Color Component Values and Native
		Packed Integer Format // Color values in R are often
		represented as strings of hexadecimal colors or named colors.
		This package offers fast conversion of these color
		representations to either an array of red/green/blue/alpha
		values or to the packed integer format used in native raster
		objects.  Functions for conversion are also exported at the 'C'
		level for use in other packages. This fast conversion of colors
		is implemented using an order-preserving minimal perfect hash
		derived from Majewski et al (1996) "A Family of Perfect Hashing
		Methods" doi:10.1093/comjnl/39.6.547.
