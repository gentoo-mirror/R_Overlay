		Kootenay Lake Exploitation Study Data // Six relational 'tibbles'
		from the Kootenay Lake Large Trout Exploitation study. The
		study which ran from 2008 to 2014 caught, tagged and released
		large Rainbow Trout and Bull Trout in Kootenay Lake by boat
		angling. The fish were tagged with internal acoustic tags
		and/or high reward external tags and subsequently detected by
		an acoustic receiver array as well as reported by anglers. The
		data are analysed by Thorley and Andrusak (1994)
		doi:10.7717/peerj.2874 to estimate the natural and fishing
		mortality of both species.
