		Color Scheme Helpers // Hexadecimal codes are typically used to
		represent colors in R. Connecting these codes to their colors
		requires practice or memorization. 'palette' provides a 'vctrs'
		class for working with color palettes, including printing and
		plotting functions. The goal of the class is to place visual
		representations of color palettes directly on or, at least,
		next to their corresponding character representations. Palette
		extensions also are provided for data frames using 'pillar'.
