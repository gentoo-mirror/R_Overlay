		Detecting Epidemics using School Absenteeism // Provides a
		comprehensive framework for early epidemic detection through
		school absenteeism surveillance. The package offers three core
		functionalities: (1) simulation of population structures,
		epidemic spread, and resulting school absenteeism patterns; (2)
		implementation of surveillance models that generate alerts for
		impending epidemics based on absenteeism data and (3)
		evaluation of alert timeliness and accuracy through alert time
		quality metrics to optimize model parameters. These tools
		enable public health officials and researchers to develop and
		assess early warning systems before implementation. Methods are
		based on research published in Vanderkruk et al. (2023)
