		Simulation, Estimation and Segmentation of Composite Based
		Structural Equation Models // The composites are linear
		combinations of their indicators in composite based structural
		equation models. Structural models are considered consisting of
		two blocks. The indicators of the exogenous composites are
		named by X, the indicators of the endogenous by Y. Reflective
		relations are given by arrows pointing  from the composite to
		their indicators. Their values are called loadings.  In a
		reflective-reflective scenario all indicators have loadings.
		Arrows are pointing to their indicators only from the
		endogenous composites in  the formative-reflective scenario.
		There are no loadings at all in the formative-formative
		scenario. The covariance matrices are computed for these three
		scenarios. They can be used to simulate these models. These
		models can also be estimated and a segmentation procedure is
		included as well.
