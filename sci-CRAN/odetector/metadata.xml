		Outlier Detection Using Partitioning Clustering Algorithms // An
		object is called "outlier" if it remarkably deviates from the
		other objects in a data set. Outlier detection is the process
		to find outliers by using the methods that are based on
		distance measures, clustering and spatial methods (Ben-Gal,
		2005 ISBN 0-387-24435-2). It is one of the intensively studied
		research topics for identification of novelties, frauds,
		anomalies, deviations or exceptions in addition to its use for
		outlier removing in data processing. This package provides the
		implementations of some novel approaches to detect the outliers
		based on typicality degrees that are obtained with the soft
		partitioning clustering algorithms such as Fuzzy C-means and
		its variants.
