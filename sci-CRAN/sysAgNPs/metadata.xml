		Systematic Quantification of AgNPs to Unleash their Potential for
		Applicability // There is variation across AgNPs due to
		differences in characterization techniques and testing metrics
		employed in studies. To address this problem, we have developed
		a systematic evaluation framework called 'sysAgNPs'. Within
		this framework, Distribution Entropy (DE) is utilized to
		measure the uncertainty of  feature categories of AgNPs,
		Proclivity Entropy (PE) assesses the preference of these
		categories, and Combination Entropy (CE) quantifies the
		uncertainty of feature combinations of AgNPs. Additionally, a
		Markov chain model is employed to examine the relationships
		among the sub-features of AgNPs and to determine a Transition
		Score (TS) scoring standard that is based on steady-state
		probabilities. The 'sysAgNPs' framework provides metrics for
		evaluating AgNPs, which helps to unravel their complexity and
		facilitates effective comparisons among different AgNPs,
		thereby advancing the scientific research and application of
		these AgNPs.
