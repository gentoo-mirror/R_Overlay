		Plotting for Bayesian Models // Plotting functions for posterior
		analysis, model checking, and MCMC diagnostics. The package is
		designed not only to provide convenient functionality for
		users, but also a common set of functions that can be easily
		used by developers working on a variety of R packages for
		Bayesian modeling, particularly (but not exclusively) packages
		interfacing with Stan.
