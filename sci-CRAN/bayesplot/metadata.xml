		Plotting for Bayesian Models // Plotting functions for posterior
		analysis, MCMC diagnostics, prior and posterior predictive
		checks, and other visualizations to support the applied
		Bayesian workflow advocated in Gabry, Simpson, Vehtari,
		Betancourt, and Gelman (2019) doi:10.1111/rssa.12378. The
		package is designed not only to provide convenient
		functionality for users, but also a common set of functions
		that can be easily used by developers working on a variety of R
		packages for Bayesian modeling, particularly (but not
		exclusively) packages interfacing with 'Stan'.
