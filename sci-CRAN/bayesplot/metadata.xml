		Plotting for Bayesian Models // Plotting functions for posterior
		analysis, prior and posterior predictive checks, and MCMC
		diagnostics. The package is designed not only to provide
		convenient functionality for users, but also a common set of
		functions that can be easily used by developers working on a
		variety of R packages for Bayesian modeling, particularly (but
		not exclusively) packages interfacing with 'Stan'.
