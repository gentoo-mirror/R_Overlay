		Correct Overloaded Peaks from GC-APCI-MS Data // Analyzes and
		modifies metabolomics raw data (generated using Gas
		Chromatography-Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-Mass
		Spectrometry) to correct overloaded signals, i.e. ion
		intensities exceeding detector saturation leading to a cut-off
		peak. Data in 'xcmsRaw' format are accepted as input and
		'mzXML' files can be processed alternatively. Overloaded
		signals are detected automatically and modified using an
		Gaussian or an Isotopic-Ratio approach. Quality control plots
		are generated and corrected data are stored within the original
		'xcmsRaw' or 'mzXML' respectively to allow further processing.
