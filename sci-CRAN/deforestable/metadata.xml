		Classify RGB Images into Forest or Non-Forest // Implements two
		out-of box classifiers presented in doi:10.1002/env.2848 for
		distinguishing forest and non-forest terrain images. Under
		these algorithms, there are frequentist approaches: one
		parametric, using stable distributions, and another one- non-
		parametric, using the squared Mahalanobis distance. The package
		also contains functions for data handling and building of new
		classifiers as well as some test data set.
