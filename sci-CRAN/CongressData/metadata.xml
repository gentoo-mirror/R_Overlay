		A Functional Tool for 'CongressData' // A tool that imports,
		subsets, and exports the 'CongressData' dataset. 'CongressData'
		contains approximately 800 variables concerning all US
		congressional districts with data back to 1789. The dataset
		tracks district characteristics, members of Congress, and the
		political behavior of those members. Users with only a basic
		understanding of R can subset this data across multiple
		dimensions, export their search results, identify the citations
		associated with their searches, and more.
