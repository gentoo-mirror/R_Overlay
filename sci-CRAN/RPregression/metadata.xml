		A Simple Regression and Plotting Tool // Perform a regression
		analysis, generate a regression table, create a scatter plot,
		and download the results. It uses 'stargazer' for generating
		regression tables and 'ggplot2' for creating plots. With just
		two lines of code, you can perform a regression analysis,
		visualize the results, and save the output. It is part of my
		make R easy project where one doesn't need to know how to use
		various packages in order to get results and makes it easily
		accessible to beginners. This is a part of my make R easy
		project. Help from 'ChatGPT' was taken. References were Wickham
