		Tukey Curve Depth and Distance in the Space of Curves // Data
		recorded as paths or trajectories may be suitably described by
		curves, which are independent of their parametrization. For the
		space of such curves, the package provides functionalities for
		reading curves, sampling points on curves, calculating distance
		between curves and for computing Tukey curve depth of a curve
		w.r.t. to a bundle of curves. For details see Lafaye De
		Micheaux, Mozharovskyi, and Vimond (2021)
