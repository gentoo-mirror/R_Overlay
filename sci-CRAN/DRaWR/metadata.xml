		Discriminative Random Walk with Restart // We present DRaWR, a
		network-based method for ranking genes or properties related to
		a given gene set. Such related genes or properties are
		identified from among the nodes of a large, heterogeneous
		network of biological information. Our method involves a random
		walk with restarts, performed on an initial network with
		multiple node and edge types, preserving more of the original,
		specific property information than current methods that operate
		on homogeneous networks. In this first stage of our algorithm,
		we find the properties that are the most relevant to the given
		gene set and extract a subnetwork of the original network,
		comprising only the relevant properties. We then rerank genes
		by their similarity to the given gene set, based on a second
		random walk with restarts, performed on the above subnetwork.
