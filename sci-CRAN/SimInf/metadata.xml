		A Framework for Data-Driven Stochastic Disease Spread Simulations
		// Provides an efficient and very flexible framework to conduct
		data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large scale
		disease spread simulations. The framework integrates infection
		dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov chains
		using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and
		incorporates available data such as births, deaths and
		movements as scheduled events at predefined time-points. Using
		C code for the numerical solvers and 'OpenMP' (if available) to
		divide work over multiple processors ensures high performance
		when simulating a sample outcome. One of our design goals was
		to make the package extendable and enable usage of the
		numerical solvers from other R extension packages in order to
		facilitate complex epidemiological research. The package
		contains template models and can be extended with user-defined
		models. For more details see the paper by Widgren, Bauer,
		Eriksson and Engblom (2019) doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i12.
