		A factory of self-describing properties. // Supports the
		definition of sets of properties on objects. Observers can
		listen to changes on individual properties or the set as a
		whole. The properties are meant to be fully self-describing. In
		support of this, there is a framework for defining enumerated
		types, as well as other bounded types, as S4 classes.
