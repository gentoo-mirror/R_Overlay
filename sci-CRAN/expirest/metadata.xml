		Expiry Estimation Procedures // The Australian Regulatory
		Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM), guidance on
		"Stability testing for prescription medicines", recommends to
		predict the shelf life of chemically derived medicines from
		stability data by taking the worst case situation at batch
		release into account. Consequently, if a change over time is
		observed, a release limit needs to be specified. Finding a
		release limit and the associated shelf life is supported, as
		well as the standard approach that is recommended by guidance
		Q1E "Evaluation of stability data" from the International
		Council for Harmonisation (ICH).
