		Spatial Pattern Detection in Genetic Distance Data Using Moran's
		Eigenvector Maps // Can detect relatively weak spatial genetic
		patterns by using Moran's Eigenvector Maps (MEM) to extract
		only the spatial component of genetic variation.  Has
		applications in landscape genetics where the movement and
		dispersal of organisms are studied using neutral genetic
		variation.
