		Microplots (Sparklines) in 'LaTeX', 'Word', 'HTML', 'Excel' //
		The microplot() function writes a set of R graphics files to be
		used as  microplots (sparklines) in tables in either 'LaTeX',
		'HTML', 'Word', or 'Excel' files.  For 'LaTeX', use the
		'Hmisc::latex' function or 'xtable::xtable' function to
		construct 'latex' tabular environments which include the
		graphs.  These can be used directly with the operating  system
		'pdflatex' or 'latex' command, or by using one of  'Sweave',
		'knitr', 'rmarkdown', or 'Emacs' 'org-mode' as  an
		intermediary.  For 'Word', the MSWord* functions use the
		'ReporteRs::FlexTable'  and 'ReporteRs::pot_img' functions to
		construct 'Word' tables which include the graphs.  There are
		several distinct approaches for constructing HTML file.  The
		simplest is to use the MSWord* with argument 'filetype="html"'.
		Alternatively, use either 'Emacs'  'org-mode' or the
		'htmlTable::htmlTable' function to  construct an 'HTML' file
		containing tables which include  the graphs.  For 'Excel' use
		on  'Windows', the file 'examples/irisExcel.xls' includes
		'VBA' code which brings the individual panels into  individual
		cells in the spreadsheet.  Examples in the  'examples'
		subdirectory and demos are shown with  'lattice' graphics,
		'base' graphics, and 'ggplot2'  graphics.  Examples for 'LaTeX'
		include 'Sweave' (both  'LaTeX'-style and 'Noweb'-style),
		'knitr', 'emacs'  'org-mode', and 'rmarkdown' input files and
		their 'pdf'  output files.  Examples for 'HTML' include 'org-
		mode' and  'Rmd' input files and their webarchive 'HTML' output
		files.  In addition, the 'as.orgtable' function can  display a
		'data.frame' in an 'org-mode' document.  The  examples for
		'Word' (with either 'filetype="docx"' or 'filetype="html"')
		work with all operating systems.  The package does not require
		the installation of 'LaTeX' or 'Word'  to be able to write
		'.tex' or '.docx' files.
