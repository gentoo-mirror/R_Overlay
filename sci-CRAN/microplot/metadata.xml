		Microplots (Sparklines) in 'LaTeX', 'Word', 'HTML', 'Excel' //
		The microplot function writes a set of R graphics files to be
		used as microplots (sparklines) in tables in either 'LaTeX',
		'HTML', 'Word', or 'Excel' files.  For 'LaTeX', we provide
		methods for the Hmisc::latex() generic function to construct
		'latex' tabular environments which include the graphs.  These
		can be used directly with the operating system 'pdflatex' or
		'latex' command, or by using one of 'Sweave', 'knitr',
		'rmarkdown', or 'Emacs org-mode' as an intermediary.  For 'MS
		Word', the msWord() function uses the 'flextable' package to
		construct 'Word' tables which include the graphs.  There are
		several distinct approaches for constructing HTML files.  The
		simplest is to use the msWord() function with argument
		filetype="html".  Alternatively, use either 'Emacs org-mode' or
		the htmlTable::htmlTable() function to construct an 'HTML' file
		containing tables which include the graphs.  See the
		documentation for our as.htmlimg() function.  For 'Excel' use
		on 'Windows', the file examples/irisExcel.xls includes 'VBA'
		code which brings the individual panels into individual cells
		in the spreadsheet. Examples in the examples and demo
		subdirectories are shown with 'lattice' graphics, 'ggplot2'
		graphics, and 'base' graphics. Examples for 'LaTeX' include
		'Sweave' (both 'LaTeX'-style and 'Noweb'-style), 'knitr',
		'emacs org-mode', and 'rmarkdown' input files and their 'pdf'
		output files.  Examples for 'HTML' include 'org-mode' and 'Rmd'
		input files and their webarchive 'HTML' output files.  In
		addition, the as.orgtable() function can display a data.frame
		in an 'org-mode' document.  The examples for 'MS Word' (with
		either filetype="docx" or filetype="html") work with all
		operating systems.  The package does not require the
		installation of 'LaTeX' or 'MS Word' to be able to write '.tex'
		or '.docx' files.
