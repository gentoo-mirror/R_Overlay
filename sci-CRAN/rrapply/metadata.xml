		Revisiting Base Rapply // The 'rrapply'-package contains a single
		function rrapply(), providing an extended implementation of
		'R'-base rapply() by allowing to recursively apply a function
		to elements of a nested list based on a general condition
		function and including the possibility to prune or aggregate
		nested list elements from the result. In addition, special
		arguments can be supplied to access the name and location in
		the nested list of the element under evaluation. The rrapply()
		function is implemented in 'R''s 'C' interface and requires no
		other package dependencies.
