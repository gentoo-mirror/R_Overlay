		Revisiting Base Rapply // The minimal 'rrapply'-package contains
		a single function rrapply(), providing an extended
		implementation of 'R'-base rapply() by allowing to recursively
		apply a function to elements of a nested list based on a
		general condition function and including the possibility to
		prune or aggregate nested list elements from the result. In
		addition, special arguments can be supplied to access the name,
		location, parents and siblings in the nested list of the
		element under evaluation. The rrapply() function builds upon
		rapply()'s native 'C' implementation and requires no other
		package dependencies.
