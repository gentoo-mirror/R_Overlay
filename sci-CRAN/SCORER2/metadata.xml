		SCORER 2.0: an algorithm for distinguishing parallel dimeric and
		trimeric coiled-coil sequences // This package contains the
		functions necessary to run the SCORER 2.0 algorithm. SCORER 2.0
		can be used to differentiate between parallel dimeric and
		trimeric coiled-coil sequence, which are the two most more
		frequent coiled-coil structures observed naturally. As such,
		SCORER 2.0 is particularly useful for researchers looking to
		characterize novel coiled-coil sequences. It may also be used
		to assist in the structural characterization of synthetic
		coiled-coil sequences. Also included in this package are
		functions that allows the user to retrain the SCORER 2.0
		algorithm using user-defined training data.
