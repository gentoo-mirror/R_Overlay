		Latent Space Item Response Model // Analysis of dichotomous and
		continuous response data using latent factor by both 1PL LSIRM
		and 2PL LSIRM as described in Jeon et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1007/s11336-021-09762-5. It includes original 1PL LSIRM
		and 2PL LSIRM provided for binary response data and its
		extension for continuous response data. Bayesian model
		selection with spike-and-slab prior and method for dealing data
		with missing value under missing at random, missing completely
		at random are also supported. Various diagnostic plots are
		available to inspect the latent space and summary of estimated
		parameters.
