		Fitting of Exponential Autoregressive (EXPAR) Model // The
		amplitude-dependent exponential autoregressive (EXPAR) time
		series model, initially proposed by Haggan and Ozaki (1981)
		doi:10.2307/2335819 has been implemented in this package.
		Throughout various studies, the model has been found to
		adequately capture the cyclical nature of datasets. Parameter
		estimation of such family of models has been tackled by the
		approach of minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS). Model
		selection among various candidate orders has been implemented
		using various information criteria, viz., Akaike information
		criteria (AIC), corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc)
		and Bayesian information criteria (BIC). An illustration
		utilizing data of egg price indices has also been provided.
