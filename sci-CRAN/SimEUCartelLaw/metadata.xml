		Simulation of Legal Exemption System for European Cartel Law //
		Monte Carlo simulations of a game-theoretic model for the legal
		exemption system of the European cartel law are implemented in
		order to estimate the (mean) deterrent effect of this system.
		The input and output parameters of the simulated cartel
		opportunities can be visualized by three-dimensional
		projections.
