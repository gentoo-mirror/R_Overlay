		Bayesian Basket Trial Design and Analysis // Provides tools for
		Bayesian basket trial design and analysis using a novel three-
		component local power prior framework with global borrowing
		control, pairwise similarity assessment and a borrowing
		threshold. Supports simulation-based evaluation of operating
		characteristics and comparison with other methods. Applicable
		to both equal and unequal sample size settings in early-phase
		oncology trials. For more details see Zhou et al. (2023)
