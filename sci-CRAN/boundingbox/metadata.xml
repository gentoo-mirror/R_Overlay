		Create a Bounding Box in an Image // Generate ground truth cases
		for object localization algorithms. Cycle through a list of
		images, select points around which to generate bounding boxes
		and assign classifiers. Output the coordinates, and images
		annotated with boxes and labels. For an example study that uses
		bounding boxes for image localization and classification see
		Ibrahim, Badr, Abdallah, and Eissa (2012) "Bounding Box Object
		Localization Based on Image Superpixelization"
