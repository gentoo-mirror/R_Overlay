		Analysis of the Interpopulation Degree of Sexual Dimorphism using
		Summary Statistics // Provides two approaches of comparison;
		the univariate and the multivariate analysis in two or more
		populations. Since the main obstacle of performing systematic
		comparisons in anthropological studies is the absence of raw
		data, the current package offer a solution for this problem by
		allowing the use of published summary statistics of metric data
		(mean, standard deviation and sex specific sample size) as
		illustrated by the works of  Greene, D. L. (1989)
		doi:10.1002/ajpa.1330790113 and Konigsberg, L. W. (1991)
