		Wrapper of Python Library 'shap' // Provides SHAP explanations of
		machine learning models. In applied machine learning, there is
		a strong belief that we need to strike a balance between
		interpretability and accuracy. However, in field of the
		Interpretable Machine Learning, there are more and more new
		ideas for explaining black-box models. One of the best known
		method for local explanations is SHapley Additive exPlanations
		(SHAP) introduced by Lundberg, S., et al., (2016)
		arXiv:1705.07874 The SHAP method is used to calculate
		influences of variables on the particular observation. This
		method is based on Shapley values, a technique used in game
		theory. The R package 'shapper' is a port of the Python library
		'shap'.
