		Identification of Location Game Equilibria in Networks //
		Identification of equilibrium locations in location games
		(Hotelling (1929) doi:10.2307/2224214). In these games, two
		competing actors place customer-serving units in two locations
		simultaneously. Customers make the decision to visit the
		location that is closest to them. The functions in this package
		include Prim algorithm (Prim (1957)
		doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01515.x) to find the minimum
		spanning tree connecting all network vertices, an
		implementation of Dijkstra algorithm (Dijkstra (1959)
		doi:10.1007/BF01386390) to find the shortest distance and path
		between any two vertices, a self-developed algorithm using
		elimination of purely dominated strategies to find the
		equilibrium, and several plotting functions.
