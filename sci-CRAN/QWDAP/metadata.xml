		Quantum Walk-Based Data Analysis and Prediction // Modeling and
		predicting time series based on continuous time quantum.This
		package can be divided into three parts: Basis Generation, Data
		Modeling and Prediction, and Model Evaluation according to the
		analysis process of time series. 'Basis Generation' has
		realized the continuous time quantum walk simulation for
		generating modes as the basis. Some regression methods are used
		to model the observed time series and predict in 'Data Modeling
		and Prediction', and 'Model Evaluation' can be used to evaluate
		the data correspondence between two series.
