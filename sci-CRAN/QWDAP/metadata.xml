		Quantum Walk-Based Data Analysis and Prediction // The modeling
		and prediction of graph-associated time series(GATS) based on
		continuous time quantum walk. This software is mainly used for
		feature extraction, modeling, prediction and result evaluation
		of GATS, including continuous time quantum walk simulation,
		feature selection, regression analysis, time series prediction,
		and series fit calculation. A paper is attached to the package
		for reference.
