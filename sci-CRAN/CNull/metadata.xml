		Fast Algorithms for Frequency-Preserving Null Models in Ecology
		// Efficient computations for null models that require
		shuffling columns on big matrix data. This package provides
		functions for faster computation of diversity measure
		statistics when independent random shuffling is applied to the
		columns of a given matrix. Given a diversity measure f and a
		matrix M, the provided functions can generate random samples
		(shuffled matrix rows of M), the mean and variance of f, and
		the p-values of this measure for two different null models that
		involve independent random shuffling of the columns of M. The
		package supports computations of alpha and beta diversity
		measures.
