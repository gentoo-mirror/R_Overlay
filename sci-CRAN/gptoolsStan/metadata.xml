		Gaussian Processes on Graphs and Lattices in 'Stan' // Gaussian
		processes are flexible distributions to model functional data.
		Whilst theoretically appealing, they are computationally
		cumbersome except for small datasets. This package implements
		two methods for scaling Gaussian process inference in 'Stan'.
		First, a sparse approximation of the likelihood that is
		generally applicable and, second, an exact method for regularly
		spaced data modeled by stationary kernels using fast Fourier
		methods. Utility functions are provided to compile and fit
		'Stan' models using the 'cmdstanr' interface. References:
