		A System for Working with Templates // Provides tools to work
		with template code and text in R. It aims to provide a simple
		substitutions mechanism for R-expressions inside these
		templates. Templates can be written in other languages like
		'SQL', can simply be represented by characters in R, or can
		themselves be R-expressions or functions.
