		Minqing Hu and Bing Liu, and "nrc" developed by Mohammad, Saif
		M. and Turney, Peter D. Applicable references are available in
		README.md and in the documentation for the "get_sentiment"
		function.  The package also provides a hack for implementing
		Stanford's coreNLP sentiment parser. The package provides
