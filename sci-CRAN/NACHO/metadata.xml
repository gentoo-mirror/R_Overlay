		NanoString Quality Control Dashboard // NanoString nCounter data
		are gene expression assays where there is no need for the use
		of enzymes or amplification protocols and work with fluorescent
		barcodes (Geiss et al. (2018) doi:10.1038/nbt1385). Each
		barcode is assigned a messenger-RNA/micro-RNA (mRNA/miRNA)
		which after bonding with its target can be counted. As a result
		each count of a specific barcode represents the presence of its
		target mRNA/miRNA. 'NACHO' (NAnoString quality Control
		dasHbOard) is able to analyse the exported NanoString nCounter
		data and facilitates the user in performing a quality control.
		'NACHO' does this by visualising quality control metrics,
		expression of control genes, principal components and sample
		specific size factors in an interactive web application.
