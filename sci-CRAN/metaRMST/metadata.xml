		Meta-Analysis of RMSTD // R implementation of a multivariate
		meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) with the
		difference in restricted mean survival times (RMSTD). Use this
		package with individual patient level data from an RCT for a
		time-to-event outcome to determine combined effect estimates
		according to 4 methods: 1)  a univariate meta-analysis using
		observed treatment effects, 2) a univariate meta-analysis using
		effects predicted by fitted Royston-Parmar flexible parametric
		models, 3) multivariate meta-analysis with analytically derived
		covariance, 4) multivariate meta-analysis with bootstrap
		derived covariance. This package computes all combined effects
		and provides an RMSTD curve with combined effect estimates and
		their confidence intervals.
