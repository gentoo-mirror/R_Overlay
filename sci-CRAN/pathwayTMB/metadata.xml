		Pathway Based Tumor Mutational Burden // A systematic
		bioinformatics tool to develop a new pathway-based gene panel
		for tumor mutational burden (TMB) assessment (pathway-based
		tumor mutational burden, PTMB), using somatic mutations files
		in an efficient manner from either The Cancer Genome Atlas
		sources or any in-house studies as long as the data is in
		mutation annotation file (MAF) format. Besides, we develop a
		multiple machine learning method using the sample's PTMB
		profiles to identify cancer-specific dysfunction pathways,
		which can be a biomarker of prognostic and predictive for
		cancer immunotherapy.
