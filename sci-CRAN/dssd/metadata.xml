		Distance Sampling Survey Design // Creates survey designs for
		distance sampling surveys. These designs can be assessed for
		various effort and coverage statistics. Once the user is
		satisfied with the design characteristics they can generate a
		set of transects to use in their distance sampling survey. Many
		of the designs implemented in this R package were first made
		available in our 'Distance' for Windows software and are
		detailed in Chapter 7 of Advanced Distance Sampling, Buckland
		et. al. (2008, ISBN-13: 978-0199225873). Find out more about
		estimating animal/plant abundance with distance sampling at
		http://distancesampling.org/.
