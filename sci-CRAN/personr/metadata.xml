		Test Your Personality // An R-package-version of an open online
		science-based personality test from
		https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/, providing a
		better-designed interface and a more detailed report. The core
		command launch_test() opens a personality test in your browser,
		and generates a report after you click "Submit". In this
		report, your results are compared with other people's, to show
		what these results mean. Other people's data is from
		https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/BIG5.zip.
