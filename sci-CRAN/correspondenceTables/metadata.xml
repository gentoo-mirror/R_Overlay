		Creating Correspondence Tables Between Two Statistical
		Classifications // A candidate correspondence table between two
		classifications can be created when there are correspondence
		tables leading from the first classification to the second one
		via intermediate 'pivot' classifications. The correspondence
		table between two statistical classifications can be updated
		when one of the classifications gets updated to a new version.
