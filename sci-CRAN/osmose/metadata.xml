		Object Oriented Simulator of Marine Ecosystems // The
		multispecies and individual-based model (IBM) 'OSMOSE' (Shin
		and Curry (2001) doi:10.1016/S0990-7440(01)01106-8 and Shin and
		Curry (2004) doi:10.1139/f03-154) focuses on fish species. This
		model assumes opportunistic predation based on spatial co-
		occurrence and size adequacy between a predator and its prey
		(size-based opportunistic predation). It represents fish
		individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by
		their size, weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location (2D
		model), and which undergo major processes of fish life cycle
		(growth, explicit predation, natural and starvation
		mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing
		exploitation. The model needs basic biological parameters that
		are often available for a wide range of species, and which can
		be found in 'FishBase' for instance (see
		http://www.fishbase.org/search.php), and fish spatial
		distribution data. This package provides tools to build and run
		simulations using the 'OSMOSE' model.
