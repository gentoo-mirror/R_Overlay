		Nominating Quality Control Outliers in Genomic Profiling Studies
		// A method that analyzes quality control metrics from multi-
		sample genomic sequencing studies and nominates poor quality
		samples for exclusion. Per sample quality control data are
		transformed into z-scores and aggregated. The distribution of
		aggregated z-scores are modelled using parametric
		distributions. The parameters of the optimal model, selected
		either by goodness-of-fit statistics or user-designation, are
		used for outlier nomination. Two implementations of the Cosine
		Similarity Outlier Detection algorithm are provided with
		flexible parameters for dataset customization.
