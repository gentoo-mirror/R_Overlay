		False Discovery Rate Procedures Under Discrete and Heterogeneous
		Null Distributions // It is known that current false discovery
		rate (FDR) procedures can be very conservative when applied to
		multiple testing in the discrete paradigm where p-values (and
		test statistics) have discrete and heterogeneous null
		distributions. This package implements more powerful weighted
		or adaptive FDR procedures for FDR control and estimation in
		the discrete paradigm. The package takes in the original data
		set rather than just the p-values in order to carry out the
		adjustments for discreteness and heterogeneity of p-value
		distributions. The package implements methods for two types of
		test statistics and their p-values: (a) binomial test on if two
		independent Poisson distributions have the same means, (b)
		Fisher's exact test on if the conditional distribution is the
		same as the marginal distribution for two binomial
		distributions, or on if two independent binomial distributions
		have the same probabilities of success.
