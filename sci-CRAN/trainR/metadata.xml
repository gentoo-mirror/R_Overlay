		An Interface to the National Rail Enquiries Systems // The goal
		of 'trainR' is to provide a simple interface to the National
		Rail Enquiries (NRE) systems. There are few data feeds
		available, the simplest of them is Darwin, which provides real-
		time arrival and departure predictions, platform numbers, delay
		estimates, schedule changes and cancellations. Other data feeds
		provide historical data, Historic Service Performance (HSP),
		and much more. 'trainR' simplifies the data retrieval, so that
		the users can focus on their analyses. For more details visit
		https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/46391.aspx.
