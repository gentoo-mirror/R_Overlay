		Degrees of Freedom of Elastic Net, Adaptive Lasso and Generalized
		Elastic Net // Computes the degrees of freedom of the lasso,
		elastic net, generalized elastic net and adaptive lasso based
		on the generalized path seeking algorithm.  The optimal model
		can be selected by model selection criteria including Mallows'
		Cp, bias-corrected AIC (AICc), generalized cross validation
		(GCV) and BIC.
