		A Multiple Testing Procedure for High-Dimensional Mediation
		Hypotheses // A multiple-testing procedure for high-dimensional
		mediation hypotheses. Mediation analysis is of rising interest
		in epidemiology and clinical trials. Among existing methods for
		mediation analyses, the popular joint significance (JS) test
		yields an overly conservative type I error rate and therefore
		low power. In the R package 'HDMT' we implement a multiple-
		testing procedure that accurately controls the family-wise
		error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate (FDR) when using
		JS for testing high-dimensional mediation hypotheses. The core
		of our procedure is based on estimating the proportions of
		three component null hypotheses and deriving the corresponding
		mixture distribution of null p-values. Results of the data
		examples include better-behaved quantile-quantile plots and
		improved detection of novel mediation relationships on the role
		of DNA methylation in genetic regulation of gene expression.
		With increasing interest in mediation by molecular
		intermediaries such as gene expression, the proposed method
		addresses an unmet methodological challenge.
