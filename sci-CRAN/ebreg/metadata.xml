		Implementation of the Empirical Bayes Method // Implements a
		Bayesian-like approach to the high-dimensional sparse linear
		regression problem based on an empirical or data-dependent
		prior distribution, which can be used for estimation/inference
		on the model parameters, variable selection, and prediction of
		a future response. The method was first presented in Martin,
		Ryan and Mess, Raymond and Walker, Stephen G (2017)
		doi:10.3150/15-BEJ797. More details focused on the prediction
		problem are given in Martin, Ryan and Tang, Yiqi (2019)
		arXiv:1903.00961.
