		Compute the Rectangular Statistical Cartogram // Provides an
		interface and a C++ implementation of the RecMap MP2
		construction heuristic (Panse C. (2018)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v086.c01). This algorithm draws maps according
		to a given statistical value (e.g., election results,
		population or epidemiological data). The basic idea of the
		RecMap algorithm is that each map region (e.g., different
		countries) is represented by a rectangle. The area of each
		rectangle represents the statistical value given as input
		(maintain zero cartographic error). Documentation about the
		usage of the recmap algorithm is provided by a vignette
		included in this package.
