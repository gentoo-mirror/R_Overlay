		Compute the Rectangular Statistical Cartogram // Implements the
		RecMap MP2 construction heuristic doi:10.1109/INFVIS.2004.57.
		This algorithm draws maps according to a given statistical
		value, e.g., election results, population, or epidemiological
		data. The basic idea of the RecMap algorithm is that each map
		region, e.g., different countries, is represented by a
		rectangle. The area of each rectangle represents the
		statistical value given as input (maintain zero cartographic
		error). C++ is used to implement the computationally intensive
		tasks. The vignette included in this package provides
		documentation about the usage of the recmap algorithm.
