		Compute the Rectangular Statistical Cartogram // Provides an
		interface and a C++ implementation of the RecMap MP2
		construction heuristic (see 'citation("recmap")' for details).
		This algorithm draws maps according to a given statistical
		value (e.g., election results, population or epidemiological
		data). The basic idea of the RecMap algorithm is that each map
		region (e.g., different countries) is represented by a
		rectangle. The area of each rectangle represents the
		statistical value given as input (maintain zero cartographic
		error). Documentation about RecMap is provided by a vignette
		included in this package.
