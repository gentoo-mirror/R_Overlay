		'DEXi' Decision Tree Analysis and Visualization // Provides a
		versatile toolkit for analyzing and visualizing 'DEXi'
		(Decision EXpert for education) decision trees, facilitating
		multi-criteria decision analysis directly within R. Users can
		read .dxi files, manipulate decision trees, and evaluate
		various scenarios. It supports sensitivity analysis through
		Monte Carlo simulations, one-at-a-time approaches, and
		variance-based methods, helping to discern the impact of input
		variations. Additionally, it includes functionalities for
		generating sampling plans and an array of visualization options
		for decision trees and analysis results. A distinctive feature
		is the synoptic table plot, aiding in the efficient comparison
		of scenarios. Whether for in-depth decision modeling or
		sensitivity analysis, this package stands as a comprehensive
		solution. Definition of sensitivity analyses available in
		Carpani, Bergez and Monod (2012)
		doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.10.002 and detailed description of
		the package soon available in Alaphilippe, Allart, Carpani,
		Cavan, Monod and Bergez (submitted to Software Impacts).
