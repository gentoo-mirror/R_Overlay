		Analysis of Selection Index in Plant Breeding // The aim of most
		plant breeding programmes is simultaneous improvement of
		several characters. An objective method involving simultaneous
		selection for several attributes then becomes necessary. It has
		been recognised that most rapid improvements in the economic
		value is expected from selection applied simultaneously to all
		the characters which determine the economic value of a plant,
		and appropriate assigned weights to each character according to
		their economic importance, heritability and correlations
		between characters. So the selection for economic value is a
		complex matter. If the component characters are combined
		together into an index in such a way that when selection is
		applied to the index, as if index is the character to be
		improved, most rapid improvement of economic value is expected.
		Such an index was first proposed by Smith (1937
		doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02143.x) based on the Fisher's
		(1936 doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x) "discriminant
		function" Dabholkar (1999 https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m
		lFtumAXQ0oClpg=PA4ots=Xgxp1qLuxSdq=elements%20of%20biometrical%
		20geneticslrpg=PP1#v=onepageqf=false). In this package
		selection index is calculated based on the Smith (1937)
		selection index method.
