		Match Cases to Controls Based on Genotype Principal Components //
		Matches cases to controls based on genotype principle
		components (PC). In order to produce better results, matches
		are based on the weighted distance of PCs where the weights are
		equal to the % variance explained by that PC. A weighted
		Mahalanobis distance metric (Kidd et al. (1987)
		DOI:10.1016/0031-3203(87)90066-5) is used to determine matches.
