		Biotic Ligand Model Engine // A chemical speciation and toxicity
		prediction model for the toxicity of metals to aquatic
		organisms. The Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) engine was originally
		programmed in 'PowerBasic' by Robert Santore and others. The
		main way the BLM can be used is to predict the toxicity of a
		metal to an organism with a known sensitivity (i.e., it is
		known how much of that metal must accumulate on that organism's
		biotic ligand to cause a physiological effect in a certain
		percentage of the population, such as a 20% loss in
		reproduction or a 50% mortality rate). The second way the BLM
		can be used is to estimate the chemical speciation of the metal
		and other constituents in water, including estimating the
		amount of metal accumulated to an organism's biotic ligand
		during a toxicity test. In the first application of the BLM,
		the amount of metal associated with a toxicity endpoint, or
		regulatory limit will be predicted, while in the second
		application, the amount of metal is known and the portions of
		that metal that exist in various forms will be determined. This
		version of the engine has been re-structured to perform the
		calculations in a different way that will make it more
		efficient in R, while also making it more flexible and easier
		to maintain in the future. Because of this, it does not
		currently match the desktop model exactly, but we hope to
		improve this comparability in the future.
