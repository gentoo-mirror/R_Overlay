		Download Data from the 'Open Case Studies' Repository // Provides
		functions to access and download data from the 'Open Case
		Studies' https://www.opencasestudies.org/ repositories on
		'GitHub' https://github.com/opencasestudies. Different
		functions enable users to grab the data they need at different
		sections in the case study, as well as download the whole case
		study repository. All the user needs to do is input the name of
		the case study being worked on. The package relies on the
		httr::GET() function to access files through the 'GitHub' API.
		The functions usethis::use_zip() and
		usethis::create_from_github() are used to clone and/or download
		the case study repositories.
