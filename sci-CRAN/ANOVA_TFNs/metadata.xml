		One-Way Analysis of Variance Based on Triangular Fuzzy Numbers //
		Long formulas and complex computations are two disadvantage of
		the extended ANOVA approach where the observed data are fuzzy
		rather that crisp; for more details see Parchami et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1007/s40747-017-0046-8. Package 'ANOVA.TFNs' can help to
		the applied users to overcome these two challenges. The most
		important functions in package 'ANOVA.TFNs' is FANOVA() which
		easily draw all membership functions of fuzzy numbers, report
		observed statistics in fuzzy ANOVA table, calculate the p-value
		and final result for Fuzzy ANOVA test at the certain
		significance level.
