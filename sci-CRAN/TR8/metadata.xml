		A Tool for Downloading Functional Traits Data for Plant Species
		// Plant ecologists often need to collect "traits" data about
		plant species which are often scattered among various
		databases: TR8 contains a set of tools which take care of
		automatically retrieving some of those functional traits data
		for plant species from publicly available databases (The
		Ecological Flora of the British Isles, LEDA traitbase,
		Ellenberg values for Italian Flora, Mycorrhizal intensity
		databases, BROT, PLANTS, Jepson Flora Project). The TR8 name,
		inspired by "car plates" jokes, was chosen since it both
		reminds of the main object of the package and is extremely
		short to type.
