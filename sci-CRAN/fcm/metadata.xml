		Inference of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) // Provides a selection
		of 6 different inference rules and 4 threshold functions in
		order to obtain the inference of the FCM (Fuzzy Cognitive Map).
		Moreover, the 'fcm' package returns a data frame of the
		concepts' values of each state after the inference procedure.
		Fuzzy cognitive maps were introduced by Kosko (1986)
		doi:10.1002/int.4550010405 providing ideal causal cognition
		tools for modeling and simulating dynamic systems.
