		Classification of RNA Sequences using Complex Network and
		Information Theory // It makes the creation of networks from
		sequences of RNA, with this is done the abstraction of
		characteristics of these networks with a methodology of maximum
		entropy for the purpose of making a classification between the
		classes of the sequences. There are two data present in the
		'BASiNET' package, "mRNA", and "ncRNA" with 10 sequences. These
		sequences were taken from the data set used in the article (LI,
		Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin, 2014)
		doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311, these sequences are used to run
		examples.
