		Multivariate Dependence with Copulas // Classes (S4) of commonly
		used elliptical, Archimedean, extreme-value and other copula
		families, as well as their rotations, mixtures and
		asymmetrizations. Nested Archimedean copulas, related tools and
		special functions. Methods for density, distribution, random
		number generation, bivariate dependence measures, Rosenblatt
		transform, Kendall distribution function, perspective and
		contour plots. Fitting of copula models with potentially partly
		fixed parameters, including standard errors. Serial
		independence tests, copula specification tests (independence,
		exchangeability, radial symmetry, extreme-value dependence,
		goodness-of-fit) and model selection based on cross-validation.
		Empirical copula, smoothed versions, and non-parametric
		estimators of the Pickands dependence function.
