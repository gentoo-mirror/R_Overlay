		Fit and Analyze Smooth Supersaturated Models // Creates an S4
		class "SSM" and defines functions for fitting smooth
		supersaturated models, a polynomial model with spline-like
		behaviour. Functions are defined for the computation of Sobol
		indices for sensitivity analysis and plotting the main effects
		using FANOVA methods. It also implements the estimation of the
		SSM metamodel error using a GP model with a variety of defined
		correlation functions.
