		Volume Approximation and Sampling of Convex Polytopes // Provides
		an R interface for 'volesti' C++ package. 'volesti' computes
		estimations of volume of polytopes given by (i) a set of
		points, (ii) linear inequalities or (iii) Minkowski sum of
		segments (a.k.a. zonotopes). There are three algorithms for
		volume estimation as well as algorithms for sampling, rounding
		and rotating polytopes. Moreover, 'volesti' provides algorithms
		for estimating copulas useful in computational finance.
