		Statistical Analysis for Task-Based Fmri Data // The
		'BayesDLMfMRI' package performs statistical analysis for task-
		based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data at both
		individual and group levels. The analysis to detect brain
		activation at the individual level is based on modeling the
		fMRI signal using Matrix-Variate Dynamic Linear Models (MDLM).
		The analysis for the group stage is based on posterior
		distributions of the state parameter obtained from the modeling
		at the individual level. In this way, this package offers
		several R functions with different algorithms to perform
		inference on the state parameter to assess brain activation for
		both individual and group stages. Those functions allow for
		parallel computation when the analysis is performed for the
		entire brain as well as analysis at specific voxels when it is
		required. References: Cardona-Jimnez (2021)
