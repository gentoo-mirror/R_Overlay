		Simple Peak Alignment for Gas-Chromatography Data // Aligns peak
		based on peak retention times and matches homologous peaks
		across samples. The underlying alignment procedure comprises
		three sequential steps. (1) Full alignment of samples by linear
		transformation of retention times to maximise similarity among
		homologous peaks (2) Partial alignment of peaks within a user-
		defined retention time window to cluster homologous peaks (3)
		Merging rows that are likely representing homologous substances
		(i.e. no sample shows peaks in both rows and the rows have
		similar retention time means). The algorithm is described in
		detail in Ottensmann et al., 2018
