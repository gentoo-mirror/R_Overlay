		R Interface to Stan // User-facing R functions are provided to
		parse, compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models by
		accessing the header-only Stan library provided by the
		'StanHeaders' package. The Stan project develops a
		probabilistic programming language that implements full
		Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo,
		rough Bayesian inference via variational approximation, and
		(optionally penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via
		optimization. In all three cases, automatic differentiation is
		used to quickly and accurately evaluate gradients without
		burdening the user with the need to derive the partial
		derivatives.
