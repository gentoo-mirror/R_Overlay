		Semiparametric Factor and Regression Models for Symmetric
		Relational Data // Estimation of the parameters in a model for
		symmetric relational data (e.g., the above-diagonal part of a
		square matrix), using a model-based eigenvalue decomposition
		and regression. Missing data is accommodated, and a posterior
		mean for missing data is calculated under the assumption that
		the data are missing at random. The marginal distribution of
		the relational data can be arbitrary, and is fit with an
		ordered probit specification. See Hoff (2007) arXiv:0711.1146
		for details on the model.
