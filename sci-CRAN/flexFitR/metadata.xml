		Flexible Non-Linear Least Square Model Fitting // Provides tools
		for flexible non-linear least squares model fitting using
		general-purpose optimization techniques. The package supports a
		variety of optimization algorithms, including those provided by
		the 'optimx' package, making it suitable for handling complex
		non-linear models. Features include parallel processing support
		via the 'future' and 'foreach' packages, comprehensive model
		diagnostics, and visualization capabilities. Implements methods
		described in Nash and Varadhan (2011,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v043.i09).
