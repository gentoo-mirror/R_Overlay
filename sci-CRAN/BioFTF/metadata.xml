		Biodiversity Assessment Using Functional Tools // The main
		drawback of the most common biodiversity indices is that
		different measures may lead to different rankings among
		communities. This instrument overcomes this limit using some
		functional tools with the diversity profiles. In particular,
		the derivatives, the curvature, the radius of curvature, the
		arc length, and the surface area are proposed. The goal of this
		method is to interpret in detail the diversity profiles and
		obtain an ordering between different ecological communities on
		the basis of diversity. In contrast to the typical indices of
		diversity, the proposed method is able to capture the
		multidimensional aspect of biodiversity, because it takes into
		account both the evenness and the richness of the species
		present in an ecological community.
