		Ecological Niche Modeling using Presence-Absence Data // A set of
		tools to perform Ecological Niche Modeling with presence-
		absence data. It includes algorithms for data partitioning,
		model fitting, calibration, evaluation, selection, and
		prediction. Other functions help to explore signals of
		ecological niche using univariate and multivariate analyses,
		and model features such as variable response curves and
		variable importance. Unique characteristics of this package are
		the ability to exclude models with concave quadratic responses,
		and the option to clamp model predictions to specific
		variables. These tools are implemented following principles
		proposed in Cobos et al., (2022) doi:10.17161/bi.v17i.15985,
		Cobos et al., (2019) doi:10.7717/peerj.6281, and Peterson et
		al., (2008) doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.11.008.
