		Estimation of the Probability of Informed Trading // A
		comprehensive bundle of utilities for the estimation of
		probability of informed trading models: original PIN in Easley
		and O'Hara (1992) and Easley et al. (1996); Multilayer PIN
		(MPIN) in Ersan (2016); Adjusted PIN (AdjPIN) in Duarte and
		Young (2009); and volume-synchronized PIN (VPIN) in Easley et
		al. (2011, 2012). Implementations of various estimation methods
		suggested in the literature are included. Additional compelling
		features comprise posterior probabilities, an implementation of
		an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and PIN
		decomposition into layers, and into bad/good components.
		Versatile data simulation tools, and trade classification
		algorithms are among the supplementary utilities. The package
		provides fast, compact, and precise utilities to tackle the
		sophisticated, error-prone, and time-consuming estimation
		procedure of informed trading, and this solely using the raw
		trade-level data.
