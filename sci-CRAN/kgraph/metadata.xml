		Knowledge Graphs Constructions and Visualizations // Knowledge
		graphs enable to efficiently visualize and gain insights into
		large-scale data analysis results, as p-values from multiple
		studies or embedding data matrices. The usual workflow is a
		user providing a data frame of association studies results and
		specifying target nodes, e.g. phenotypes, to visualize. The
		knowledge graph then shows all the features which are
		significantly associated with the phenotype, with the edges
		being proportional to the association scores. As the user adds
		several target nodes and grouping information about the nodes
		such as biological pathways, the construction of such graphs
		soon becomes complex. The 'kgraph' package aims to enable users
		to easily build such knowledge graphs, and provides two main
		features: first, to enable building a knowledge graph based on
		a data frame of concepts relationships, be it p-values or
		cosine similarities; second, to enable determining an
		appropriate cut-off on cosine similarities from a complete
		embedding matrix, to enable the building of a knowledge graph
		directly from an embedding matrix. The 'kgraph' package
		provides several display, layout and cut-off options, and has
		already proven useful to researchers to enable them to
		visualize large sets of p-value associations with various
		phenotypes, and to quickly be able to visualize embedding
		results. Two example datasets are provided to demonstrate these
		behaviors, and several live 'shiny' applications are hosted by
		the CELEHS laboratory and Parse Health, as the KESER Mental
		Health application https://keser-mental-health.parse-
		health.org/ based on Hong C. (2021)
