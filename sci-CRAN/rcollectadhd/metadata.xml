		Collection of Data Sets Containing ADHD Related Data // A
		collection of data sets relating to ADHD (Attention Deficit
		Hyperactivity Disorder) which have been sourced from other
		packages on CRAN or from publications on other websites such as
		Kaggle http://www.kaggle.com/.The package also includes some
		simple functions for analysing data sets. The data sets and
		descriptions of the data sets may differ from what is on CRAN
		or other source websites. The aim of this package is to bring
		together data sets from a variety of ADHD research
		publications. This package would be useful for those interested
		in finding out what research has been done on the topic of
		ADHD, or those interested in comparing the results from
		different existing works. I started this project because I
		wanted to put together a collection of the data sets relevant
		to ADHD research, which I have a personal interest in. This
		work was conducted with the support of my mentor within the
		Global Talent Mentoring platform.
