		Censored Regression with Conditional Heteroscedasticity //
		Different approaches to censored or truncated regression with
		conditional heteroscedasticity are provided. First, continuous
		distributions can be used for the (right and/or left censored
		or truncated) response with separate linear predictors for the
		mean and variance. Second, cumulative link models for ordinal
		data (obtained by interval-censoring continuous data) can be
		employed for heteroscedastic extended logistic regression
		(HXLR). In the latter type of models, the intercepts depend on
		the thresholds that define the intervals. Infrastructure for
		working with censored or truncated normal, logistic, and
		Student-t distributions, i.e., d/p/q/r functions and
		distributions3 objects.
