		Bayesian Exponential Smoothing Models with Trend Modifications //
		An implementation of a number of Global Trend models for time
		series forecasting that are Bayesian generalizations and
		extensions of some Exponential Smoothing models. The main
		differences/additions include 1) nonlinear global trend, 2)
		Student-t error distribution, and 3) a function for the error
		size, so heteroscedasticity. The methods are particularly
		useful for short time series. When tested on the well-known M3
		dataset, they are able to outperform all classical time series
		algorithms. The models are fitted with MCMC using the 'rstan'
		package.
