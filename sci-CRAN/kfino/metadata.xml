		Kalman Filter for Impulse Noised Outliers // A method for
		detecting outliers with a Kalman filter on impulsed noised
		outliers and prediction on cleaned data. 'kfino' is a robust
		sequential algorithm allowing to filter data with a large
		number of outliers. This algorithm is based on simple latent
		linear Gaussian processes as in the Kalman Filter method and is
		devoted to detect impulse-noised outliers. These are data
		points that differ significantly from other observations. 'ML'
		(Maximization Likelihood) and 'EM' (Expectation-Maximization
		algorithm) algorithms were implemented in 'kfino'. The method
		is described in full details in the following arXiv e-Print:
		arXiv:2208.00961.
