		Advanced Forest Plot Using 'grid' Graphics // Allows the creation
		of forest plots with advanced features, such as multiple
		confidence intervals per row, customizable fonts for individual
		text elements, and flexible confidence interval drawing. It
		also supports mixing text with mathematical expressions. The
		package extends the application of forest plots beyond
		traditional meta-analyses, offering a more general version of
		the original 'rmeta' packages forestplot() function. It relies
		heavily on the 'grid' package for rendering the plots.
