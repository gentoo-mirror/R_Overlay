		Implement Covariate-Adaptive Randomization // Implementing seven
		Covariate-Adaptive Randomization to assign patients to two
		treatments. Three of these procedures can also accommodate
		quantitative and mixed covariates. Given a set of covariates,
		the user can generate a single sequence of allocations or
		replicate the design multiple times by simulating the patients'
		covariate profiles. At the end, an extensive assessment of the
		performance of the randomization procedures is provided,
		calculating several imbalance measures. See Baldi Antognini A,
		Frieri R, Zagoraiou M and Novelli M (2022)
