		High Performance Algorithms for Vine Copula Modeling // Provides
		an interface to 'vinecopulib', a C++ library for vine copula
		modeling based on 'Boost' and 'Eigen'. The 'rvinecopulib'
		package implements the core features of the popular
		'VineCopula' package, in particular inference algorithms for
		both vine copula and bivariate copula models. Advantages over
		'VineCopula' are a sleeker and more modern API, improved
		performances, especially in high dimensions, nonparametric and
		multi-parameter families. The 'rvinecopulib' package includes
		'vinecopulib' as header-only C++ library (currently version
		0.3.1). Thus users do not need to install 'vinecopulib' itself
		in order to use 'rvinecopulib'. Since their initial releases,
		'vinecopulib' is licensed under the MIT License, and
		'rvinecopulib' is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.
