		Multi-Core Replicate // Multi-core replication function to make
		it easier to do fast Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the
		mcreplicate() function from the 'rethinking' package. The
		'rethinking' package requires installing 'rstan', which is
		onerous to install, while also not adding capabilities to this
		function.
