		Hierarchical Integrative Group LASSO // Environmental health
		studies are increasingly measuring multiple pollutants to
		characterize the joint health effects attributable to exposure
		mixtures. However, the underlying dose-response relationship
		between toxicants and health outcomes of interest may be highly
		nonlinear, with possible nonlinear interaction effects.
		Hierarchical integrative group least absolute shrinkage and
		selection operator (HiGLASSO), developed by Boss et al (2020)
		arXiv:2003.12844, is a general framework to identify noteworthy
		nonlinear main and interaction effects in the presence of group
		structures among a set of exposures.
