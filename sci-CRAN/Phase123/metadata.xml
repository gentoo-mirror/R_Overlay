		Simulating and Conducting Phase 123 Trials // Contains three
		simulation functions for implementing the entire Phase 123
		trial and the separate Eff-Tox and Phase 3 portions of the
		trial, which may be beneficial for use on clusters. The
		functions AssignEffTox() and RandomizeEffTox() assign doses to
		patient cohorts during phase 12 and Reoptimize() determines the
		optimal dose to continue with during Phase 3. The functions
		ReturnMeansAgent() and ReturnMeanControl() gives the true mean
		survival for the agent doses and control and ReturnOCS() gives
		the operating characteristics of the design.
