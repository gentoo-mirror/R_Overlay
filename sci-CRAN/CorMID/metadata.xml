		Correct Mass Isotopologue Distribution Vectors // In metabolic
		flux experiments tracer molecules (often glucose containing
		labelled carbon) are incorporated in compounds measured using
		mass spectrometry. The mass isotopologue distributions of these
		compounds needs to be corrected for natural abundance of
		labelled carbon and other effects, which are specific on the
		compound and ionization technique applied. This package
		provides functions to correct such effects in gas
		chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass
		spectrometry analyses.
