		Power Analysis via Monte Carlo Simulation for Correlated Data //
		A flexible framework for power analysis using Monte Carlo
		simulation for settings in which considerations of the
		correlations between predictors are important. Users can set up
		a data generative model that preserves dependence structures
		among predictors given existing data (continuous, binary, or
		ordinal). Users can also generate power curves to assess the
		trade-offs between sample size, effect size, and power of a
		design. This package includes several statistical models common
		in environmental mixtures studies. For more details and
		tutorials, see Nguyen et al. (2022) arXiv:2209.08036.
