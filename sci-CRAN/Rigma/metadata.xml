		Access to the 'Figma' API // The goal of Rigma is to provide a
		user friendly client to the 'Figma' API
		https://www.figma.com/developers/api. It uses the latest
		`httr2` for a stable interface with the REST API. More than 20
		methods are provided to interact with 'Figma' files, and teams.
		Get design data into R by reading published components and
		styles, converting and downloading images, getting access to
		the full 'Figma' file as a hierarchical data structure, and
		much more. Enhance your creativity and streamline the
		application development by automating the extraction,
		transformation, and loading of design data to your applications
		and 'HTML' documents.
