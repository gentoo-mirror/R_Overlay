		Access to the 'Figma' API // The 'Figma' API allows for
		interactions and read access to 'Figma' files
		https://www.figma.com/developers/api. This enables you to
		inspect any objects or layers, as well as their properties, and
		extract them so you may render them as images outside of
		'Figma'. Then you can present your designs, extract design data
		that can be used for 'Shiny' and 'Rmarkdown', integrate them
		with other systems, or use them to realize your original ideas.
