		A Data-Driven Similarity Kernel on Probability Spaces // We
		present a rank-based Mercer kernel to compute a pair-wise
		similarity metric corresponding to informative representation
		of data. We tailor the development of a kernel to encode our
		prior knowledge about the data distribution over a probability
		space. The philosophical concept behind our construction is
		that objects whose feature values fall on the extreme of that
		features probability mass distribution are more similar to each
		other, than objects whose feature values lie closer to the
		mean. Semblance emphasizes features whose values lie far away
		from the mean of their probability distribution. The kernel
		relies on properties empirically determined from the data and
		does not assume an underlying distribution. The use of feature
		ranks on a probability space ensures that Semblance is
		computational efficacious, robust to outliers, and
		statistically stable, thus making it widely applicable
		algorithm for pattern analysis. The output from the kernel is a
		square, symmetric matrix that gives proximity values between
		pairs of observations.
