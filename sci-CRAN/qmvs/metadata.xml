		Queueing Model of Visual Search // The queueing model of visual
		search models the accuracy and response time data in a visual
		search experiment using queueing models with finite customer
		population and stopping criteria of completing the service for
		finite number of customers. It implements the conceptualization
		of a hybrid model proposed by Moore and Wolfe (2001), in which
		visual stimuli enter the processing one after the other and
		then are identified in parallel. This package provides
		functions that simulate the specified queueing process and
		calculate the Wasserstein distance between the empirical
		response times and the model prediction.
