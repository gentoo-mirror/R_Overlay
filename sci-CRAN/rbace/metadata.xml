		'Bielefeld' Academic Search Engine ('BASE') Client // Interface
		to the API for the 'Bielefeld' Academic Search Engine ('BASE')
		(https://www.base-search.net/). 'BASE' is a search engine for
		more than 150 million scholarly documents from more than 7000
		sources. Methods are provided for searching for documents, as
		well as getting information on higher level groupings of
		documents: collections and repositories within collections.
		Search includes faceting, so you can get a high level overview
		of number of documents across a given variable (e.g., year).
		'BASE' asks users to respect a rate limit, but does not enforce
		it themselves; we enforce that rate limit.
