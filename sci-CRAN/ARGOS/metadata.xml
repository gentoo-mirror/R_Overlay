		Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS) //
		Comprehensive set of tools for performing system identification
		of both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems directly from
		data. The Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS)
		simplifies the complex task of constructing mathematical models
		of dynamical systems from observed input and output data,
		supporting various types of systems, including those described
		by ordinary differential equations. It employs optimal
		numerical derivatives for enhanced accuracy and employs formal
		variable selection techniques to help identify the most
		relevant variables, thereby enabling the development of
		predictive models for system behavior analysis.
