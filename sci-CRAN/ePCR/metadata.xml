		Ensemble Penalized Cox Regression for Survival Prediction // The
		top-performing ensemble-based Penalized Cox Regression (ePCR)
		framework developed during the DREAM 9.5 mCRPC Prostate Cancer
		Challenge https://www.synapse.org/ProstateCancerChallenge
		presented in Guinney J, Wang T, Laajala TD, et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30560-5 is provided here-in, together
		with the corresponding follow-up work. While initially aimed at
		modeling the most advanced stage of prostate cancer, metastatic
		Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC), the modeling
		framework has subsequently been extended to cover also the non-
		metastatic form of advanced prostate cancer (CRPC). Readily
		fitted ensemble-based model S4-objects are provided, and a
		simulated example dataset based on a real-life cohort is
		provided from the Turku University Hospital, to illustrate the
		use of the package. Functionality of the ePCR methodology
		relies on constructing ensembles of strata in patient cohorts
		and averaging over them, with each ensemble member consisting
		of a highly optimized penalized/regularized Cox regression
		model. Various cross-validation and other modeling schema are
		provided for constructing novel model objects.
