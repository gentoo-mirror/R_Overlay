		Convenient Tool for Solving the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree
		Problem // The Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree problem asks to
		find a subgraph connecting a given set of vertices with the
		most expensive nodes and least expensive edges. Since it is
		proven to be NP-hard, exact and efficient algorithm does not
		exist. This package provides convenient functionality for
		obtaining an approximate solution to this problem using loopy
		belief propagation algorithm.
