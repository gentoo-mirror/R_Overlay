		Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant Tests of Equivalence //
		Implementation of uniformly most powerful invariant equivalence
		tests for one- and two-sample problems (paired and unpaired) as
		described in Wellek (2010, ISBN:978-1-4398-0818-4). Also one-
		sided alternatives (non-inferiority and non-superiority tests)
		are supported. Basically a variant of a t-test with (relaxed)
		null and alternative hypotheses exchanged.
