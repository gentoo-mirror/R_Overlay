		Double Machine Learning in R // Implementation of the
		double/debiased machine learning framework of Chernozhukov et
		al. (2018) doi:10.1111/ectj.12097 for partially linear
		regression models, partially linear instrumental variable
		regression models, interactive regression models and
		interactive instrumental variable regression models. 'DoubleML'
		allows estimation of the nuisance parts in these models by
		machine learning methods and computation of the Neyman
		orthogonal score functions. 'DoubleML' is built on top of
		'mlr3' and the 'mlr3' ecosystem. The object-oriented
		implementation of 'DoubleML' based on the 'R6' package is very
		flexible.
