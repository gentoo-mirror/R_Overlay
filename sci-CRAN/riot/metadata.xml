		R Inputs/Outputs for Tractography // An input-output interface
		for reading in and writing out common VTK formats that store
		tractography data. This data comes in the form of 3D polygons
		with possibly attributes at each point. These are obtained via
		tracking algorithms from diffusion MRI and are a non-invasive
		way of studying brain structural connectivity.
