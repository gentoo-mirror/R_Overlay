		Estimation of Distribution Algorithms Based on Copulas // This
		package provides a platform where Estimation of Distribution
		Algorithms (EDAs) based on copulas can be implemented and
		studied. It contains complete implementations of various EDAs
		based on copulas and vines, and it also offers the possibility
		of implementing new algorithms. EDAs are implemented using S4
		classes with generic functions for its main parts: seeding,
		selection, learning, sampling, replacement, local optimization,
		termination, and reporting. The package also provides a group
		of well-known benchmark problems and utility functions to study
		the behavior of EDAs.
