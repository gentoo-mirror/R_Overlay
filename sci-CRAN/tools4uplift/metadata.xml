		Tools for Uplift Modeling // Uplift modeling aims at predicting
		the causal effect of an action such as a marketing campaign on
		a particular individual. In order to simplify the task for
		practitioners in uplift modeling, we propose a combination of
		tools that can be separated into the following ingredients: i)
		quantization, ii) visualization, iii) variable selection, iv)
		parameters estimation and, v) model validation. For more
		details, see
