		Tools for Uplift Modeling // Uplift modeling aims at predicting
		the causal effect of an action such as medical treatment or a
		marketing campaign on a particular individual by taking into
		consideration the response to a treatment. In order to simplify
		the task for practitioners in uplift modeling, we propose a
		combination of tools that can be separated into the following
		ingredients: i) categorization, ii) visualization, iii) feature
		engineering, iv) feature selection and v) model validation. For
		a review of uplift modeling, please read Gutierrez and
		Gc3a9rardy (2017)
