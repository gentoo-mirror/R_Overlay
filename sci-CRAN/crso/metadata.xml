		Cancer Rule Set Optimization ('crso') // An algorithm for
		identifying candidate driver combinations in cancer. CRSO is
		based on a theoretical model of cancer in which a cancer rule
		is defined to be a collection of two or more events (i.e.,
		alterations) that are minimally sufficient to cause cancer. A
		cancer rule set is a set of cancer rules that collectively are
		assumed to account for all of ways to cause cancer in the
		population. In CRSO every event is designated explicitly as a
		passenger or driver within each patient. Each event is
		associated with a patient-specific, event-specific passenger
		penalty, reflecting how unlikely the event would have happened
		by chance, i.e., as a passenger. CRSO evaluates each rule set
		by assigning all samples to a rule in the rule set, or to the
		null rule, and then calculating the total statistical penalty
		from all unassigned event. CRSO uses a three phase procedure
		find the best rule set of fixed size K for a range of Ks. A
		core rule set is then identified from among the best rule sets
		of size K as the rule set that best balances rule set size and
		statistical penalty. Users should consult the 'crso' vignette
		for an example walk through of a full CRSO run. The full
		description, of the CRSO algorithm is presented in: Klein MI,
		Cannataro V, Townsend J, Stern DF and Zhao H. "Identifying
		combinations of cancer driver in individual patients." BioRxiv
		674234 [Preprint]. June 19, 2019. doi:10.1101/674234. Please
