		Generalized Extended Triangular Designs ('GETdesigns') // Since
		their introduction by Bose and Nair (1939)
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/40383923, partially balanced
		incomplete block (PBIB) designs remain an important class of
		incomplete block designs. The concept of association scheme was
		used by Bose and Shimamoto (1952)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.1952.10501161 for the classification of
		these designs. The constraint of resources always motivates the
		experimenter to advance towards PBIB designs, more specifically
		to higher associate class PBIB designs from balanced incomplete
		block designs. It is interesting to note that many times higher
		associate PBIB designs perform better than their counterpart
		lower associate PBIB designs for the same set of parameters v,
		b, r, k and lambda_i (i=1,2...m). This package contains
		functions named GETD() for generating m-associate (m=2) class
		PBIB designs along with parameters (v, b, r, k and lambda_i, i
		= 1, 2,,m) based on Generalized Triangular (GT) Association
		Scheme. It also calculates the Information matrix, Average
		variance factor and canonical efficiency factor of the
		generated design. These designs, besides having good
		efficiency, require smaller number of replications and smallest
		possible concurrence of treatment pairs.
