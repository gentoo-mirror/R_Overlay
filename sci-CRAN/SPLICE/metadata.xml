		Synthetic Paid Loss and Incurred Cost Experience (SPLICE)
		Simulator // An extension to the individual claim simulator
		called 'SynthETIC' (on CRAN), to simulate the evolution of case
		estimates of incurred losses through the lifetime of an
		insurance claim. The transactional simulation output now
		comprises key dates, and both claim payments and revisions of
		estimated incurred losses. An initial set of test parameters,
		designed to mirror the experience of a real insurance
		portfolio, were set up and applied by default to generate a
		realistic test data set of incurred histories (see vignette).
		However, the distributional assumptions used to generate this
		data set can be easily modified by users to match their
		experiences. Reference: Avanzi B, Taylor G, Wang M (2021)
