		Fast Data Aggregation, Modification, and Filtering with Pipes and
		'data.table' // Provides pipe-style interface for 'data.table'.
		Package preserves all 'data.table' features without significant
		impact on performance. 'let' and 'take' functions are
		simplified interfaces for most common data manipulation tasks.
		For example, you can write 'take(mtcars, mean(mpg), by = am)'
		for aggregation or 'let(mtcars, hp_wt = hp/wt, hp_wt_mpg =
		hp_wt/mpg)' for modification. Use 'take_if/let_if' for
		conditional aggregation/modification. 'query_if' function
		translates its arguments one-to-one to '[.data.table' method.
		Additionally there are some conveniences such as automatic
		'data.frame' conversion to 'data.table'.
