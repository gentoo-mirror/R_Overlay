		Co-Clustering Adjusted Rand Index and Bikm1 Procedure for
		Contingency and Binary Data-Sets // Co-clustering of the rows
		and columns of a contingency or binary matrix, or double binary
		matrices and model selection for the number of row and column
		clusters. Three models are considered: the Poisson latent block
		model for contingency matrix, the binary latent block model for
		binary matrix and a new model we develop: the multiple latent
		block model for double binary matrices. A new procedure named
		bikm1 is implemented to investigate more efficiently the grid
		of numbers of clusters. Then, the studied model selection
		criteria are the integrated completed likelihood (ICL) and the
		Bayesian integrated likelihood (BIC). Finally, the co-
		clustering adjusted Rand index (CARI) to measure agreement
		between co-clustering partitions is implemented. Robert Valerie
