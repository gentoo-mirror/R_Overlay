		Zigzag Expanded Navigation Plots // Graphical tools for
		visualizing high-dimensional data along a path of alternating
		one- and two-dimensional plots. Includes optional interactive
		graphics via 'loon' (which uses 'tcltk' from base R). Support
		is provided for constructing graph structures and, when
		available, plotting them with Bioconductor packages (e.g.,
		'graph', 'Rgraphviz'); these are optional and
		examples/vignettes are skipped if they are not installed. For
		algorithms and further details, see doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i04.
