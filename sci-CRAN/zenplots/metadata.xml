		Zigzag Expanded Navigation Plots // Graphical tools for
		visualizing high-dimensional data along a path of alternating
		one- and two-dimensional plots. Note that this includes
		interactive graphics plots based on 'loon' in turn based on
		'tcltk' (included as part of the standard R distribution).  It
		also requires 'graph' from Bioconductor. For more detail on use
		and algorithms, see doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i04.
