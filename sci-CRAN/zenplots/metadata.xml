		Zigzag Expanded Navigation Plots // Graphical tools for
		visualizing high-dimensional data with a path of pairs. Note
		that this requires 'graph' from Bioconductor. Furthermore, if
		you want to use dynamic graphics based on 'loon', you need to
		have R configured with Tcl/Tk support and you need to have
		'loon' installed, for example, from
		https://github.com/waddella/loon.
