		Generalized Beta Distribution of the Second Kind: Properties,
		Likelihood, Estimation // The GB2 package explores the
		Generalized Beta distribution of the second kind. Density,
		cumulative distribution function, quantiles and moments of the
		distribution are given. Functions for the full log-likelihood,
		the profile log-likelihood and the scores are provided.
		Formulas for various indicators of inequality and poverty under
		the GB2 are implemented. The GB2 is fitted by the methods of
		maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation using the full and profile
		log-likelihood, and non-linear least squares estimation of the
		model parameters. Various plots for the visualization and
		analysis of the results are provided. Variance estimation of
		the parameters is provided for the method of maximum pseudo-
		likelihood estimation. A mixture distribution based on the
		compounding property of the GB2 is presented (denoted as
		"compound" in the documentation). This mixture distribution is
		based on the discretization of the distribution of the
		underlying random scale parameter. The discretization can be
		left or right tail. Density, cumulative distribution function,
		moments and quantiles for the mixture distribution are
		provided. The compound mixture distribution is fitted using the
		method of maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation. The fit can
		also incorporate the use of auxiliary information. In this new
		version of the package, the mixture case is complemented with
		new functions for variance estimation by linearization and
		comparative density plots.
