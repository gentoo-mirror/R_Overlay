		Provide SLT Tools for 'rpart' and 'tree' to Study Decision Trees
		// Learning, in Machine Learning (ML) area, is one of the most
		important steps in the construction of algorithms that seek to
		predict a certain task, whether this is the classification of
		objects, the forecast of demand for a specific product or even
		the diagnosis of malignant diseases. In ML, we can study
		supervised (which have a label, e.g., a class) and unsupervised
		algorithms, used for tasks such as pattern detection, grouping,
		among others that do not depend directly on a label. Knowing
		this, the present work aims to carry out the study of different
		supervised learning algorithms, in this case, the
		classification algorithms, more specifically Decision Trees, to
		carry out an analytical study about the steps that make up the
		learning process of the algorithm, exploring concepts of the
		statistical learning theory (SLT) that provide tools for
		studies and allow to prove issues such as the guarantee of
		learning of a certain algorithm. Reference: Rodrigo Fernandes
