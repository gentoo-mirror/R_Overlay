		Smooth Survival Models, Including Generalized Survival Models //
		R implementation of generalized survival models (GSMs), smooth
		accelerated failure time (AFT) models and Markov multi-state
		models. For the GSMs, g(S(t|x))=eta(t,x) for a link function g,
		survival S at time t with covariates x and a linear predictor
		eta(t,x). The main assumption is that the time effect(s) are
		smooth doi:10.1177/0962280216664760. For fully parametric
		models with natural splines, this re-implements Stata's 'stpm2'
		function, which are flexible parametric survival models
		developed by Royston and colleagues. We have extended the
		parametric models to include any smooth parametric smoothers
		for time. We have also extended the model to include any smooth
		penalized smoothers from the 'mgcv' package, using penalized
		likelihood. These models include left truncation, right
		censoring, interval censoring, gamma frailties and normal
		random effects doi:10.1002/sim.7451. For the smooth AFTs,
		S(t|x) = S_0(t*eta(t,x)), where the baseline survival function
		S_0(t)=exp(-exp(eta_0(t))) is modelled for natural splines for
		eta_0, and the time-dependent cumulative acceleration factor
		eta(t,x)=\int_0^t exp(eta_1(u,x)) du for log acceleration
		factor eta_1(u,x). The Markov multi-state models allow for a
		range of models with smooth transitions to predict transition
		probabilities, length of stay, utilities and costs, with
		differences, ratios and standardisation.
