		Generalized Survival Models // R implementation of generalized
		survival models, where g(S(t|x))=eta(t,x) for a link function
		g, survival S at time t with covariates x and a linear
		predictor eta(t,x). The main assumption is that the time
		effect(s) are smooth. For fully parametric models with natural
		splines, this re-implements Stata's 'stpm2' function, which are
		flexible parametric survival models developed by Royston and
		colleagues. We have extended the parametric models to include
		any smooth parametric smoothers for time. We have also extended
		the model to include any smooth penalized smoothers from the
		'mgcv' package, using penalized likelihood. These models
		include left truncation, right censoring, interval censoring,
		gamma frailties and normal random effects. This also includes a
		smooth implementation of accelerated failure time models.
