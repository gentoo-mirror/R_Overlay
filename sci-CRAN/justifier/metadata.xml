		Human and Machine-Readable Justifications and Justified Decisions
		Based on 'YAML' // Leverages the 'yum' package to implement a
		'YAML' ('YAML Ain't Markup Language', a human friendly standard
		for data serialization; see https:yaml.org) standard for
		documenting justifications, such as for decisions taken during
		the planning, execution and analysis of a study or during the
		development of a behavior change intervention as illustrated by
		Marques  Peters (2019) doi:10.17605/osf.io/ndxha. These
		justifications are both human- and machine-readable,
		facilitating efficient extraction and organisation.
