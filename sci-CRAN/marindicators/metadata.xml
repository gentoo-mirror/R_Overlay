		Marine Ecosystem and Fishing Pressure Indicators // Provides
		functions to calculate indicators for four marine ecosystem
		attributes (Biodiversity, Ecosystem Structure and Functioning,
		Ecosystem Stability and Resistance to Perturbations, Resource
		Potential) and one marine ecosystem pressure (Fishing Pressure)
		from fishery independent trawl survey data and commercial
		landings data. All indicators were selected and evaluated using
		the Indicator Selection Guidance Framework developed by Bundy,
