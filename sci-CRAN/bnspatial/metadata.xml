		Spatial Implementation of Bayesian Networks and Mapping // Allows
		spatial implementation of Bayesian networks and mapping in
		geographical space. It makes maps of expected value (or most
		likely state) given known and unknown conditions, maps of
		uncertainty measured as coefficient of variation or Shannon
		index (entropy), maps of probability associated to any states
		of any node of the network. Some additional features are
		provided as well: parallel processing options, data
		discretization routines and function wrappers designed for
		users with minimal knowledge of the R language. Outputs can be
		exported to any common GIS format.
