		Preprocessing Record Linkage // In this record linkage package,
		data preprocessing has been meticulously executed to cover a
		wide range of datasets, ensuring that variable names are
		standardized using synonyms. This approach facilitates seamless
		data integration and analysis across various datasets. While
		users have the flexibility to modify variable names, the system
		intelligently ensures that changes are only permitted when they
		do not compromise data consistency or essential variable
		essence.
