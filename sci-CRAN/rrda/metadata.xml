		Ridge Redundancy Analysis for High-Dimensional Omics Data //
		Efficient framework for ridge redundancy analysis (rrda),
		tailored for high-dimensional omics datasets where the number
		of predictors exceeds the number of samples. The method
		leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to avoid direct
		inversion of the covariance matrix, enhancing scalability and
		performance. It also introduces a memory-efficient storage
		strategy for coefficient matrices, enabling practical use in
		large-scale applications. The package supports cross-validation
		for selecting regularization parameters and reduced-rank
		dimensions, making it a robust and flexible tool for
		multivariate analysis in omics research. Please refer to our
		article (Yoshioka et al., 2025) for more details.
