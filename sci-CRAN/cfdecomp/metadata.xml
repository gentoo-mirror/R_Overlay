		Counterfactual Decomposition: MC Integration of the G-Formula //
		Provides a set of functions for counterfactual decomposition
		(cfdecomp). The functions available in this package decompose
		differences in an outcome attributable to a mediating variable
		(or sets of mediating variables) between groups based on
		counterfactual (causal inference) theory. By using Monte Carlo
		(MC) integration (simulations based on empirical estimates from
		multivariable models) we provide added flexibility compared to
		existing (analytical) approaches, at the cost of computational
		power or time. The added flexibility means that we can
		decompose difference between groups in any outcome or and with
		any mediator (any variable type and distribution). See
		Sudharsanan  Bijlsma (2019) doi:10.4054/MPIDR-WP-2019-004 for
		more information.
