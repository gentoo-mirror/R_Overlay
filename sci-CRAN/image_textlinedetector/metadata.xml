		Segment Images in Text Lines and Words // Find text lines in
		scanned images and segment the lines into words. Includes
		implementations of the paper 'Novel A* Path Planning Algorithm
		for Line Segmentation of Handwritten Documents' by Surinta O.
		et al (2014) doi:10.1109/ICFHR.2014.37 available at
		https://github.com/smeucci/LineSegm, an implementation of 'A
		Statistical approach to line segmentation in handwritten
		documents' by Arivazhagan M. et al (2007)
		doi:10.1117/12.704538, and a wrapper for an image segmentation
		technique to detect words in text lines as described in the
		paper 'Scale Space Technique for Word Segmentation in
		Handwritten Documents' by Manmatha R. and Srimal N. (1999)
		paper at doi:10.1007/3-540-48236-9_3, wrapper for code
		available at https://github.com/arthurflor23/text-segmentation.
		Provides as well functionality to put cursive text in images
		upright using the approach defined in the paper 'A new
		normalization technique for cursive handwritten words' by
		Vinciarelli A. and Luettin J. (2001)
		doi:10.1016/S0167-8655(01)00042-3.
