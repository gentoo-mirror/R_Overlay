		Area of Resilience to Stress Event // A method for quantifying
		resilience after a stress event. A set of functions calculate
		the area of resilience that is created by the departure of
		baseline 'y' (i.e., robustness) and the time taken 'x' to
		return to baseline (i.e., rapidity) after a stress event using
		the Cartesian coordinates of the data. This package has the
		capability to calculate areas of resilience, growth, and cases
		in which resilience is not achieved (e.g., diminished
		performance without return to baseline).
