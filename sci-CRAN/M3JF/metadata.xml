		Multi-Modal Matrix Joint Factorization for Integrative Multi-
		Omics Data Analysis // Multi modality data matrices are
		factorized conjointly into the multiplication of a shared sub-
		matrix and multiple modality specific sub-matrices, group
		sparse constraint is applied to the shared sub-matrix to
		capture the homogeneous and heterogeneous information,
		respectively. Then the samples are classified by clustering the
		shared sub-matrix with kmeanspp(), a new version of kmeans()
		developed here to obtain concordant results. The package also
		provides the cluster number estimation by rotation cost.
		Moreover, cluster specific features could be retrieved using
		hypergeometric tests.
