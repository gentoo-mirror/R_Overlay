		User Friendly Data Visualization // A comprehensive visualization
		toolkit built with coders of all skill levels and color-vision
		impaired audiences in mind. It allows creation of finely-tuned,
		publication-quality figures from single function calls.
		Visualizations include scatter plots, compositional bar plots,
		violin, box, and ridge plots, and more. Customization ranges
		from size and title adjustments to discrete-group circling and
		labeling, hidden data overlay upon cursor hovering via
		ggplotly() conversion, and many more, all with simple, discrete
		inputs. Color blindness friendliness is powered by legend
		adjustments (enlarged keys), and by allowing the use of shapes
		or letter-overlay in addition to the carefully selected
		dittoColors().
