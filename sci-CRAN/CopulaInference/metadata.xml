		Estimation and Goodness-of-Fit of Copula-Based Models with
		Arbitrary Distributions // Estimation and goodness-of-fit
		functions for copula-based models of bivariate data with
		arbitrary distributions  (discrete, continuous, mixture of both
		types). The copula families considered here are the  Gaussian,
		Student, Clayton, Frank, Gumbel, Joe, Plackett, BB1, BB6,
		BB7,BB8, together with the following non-central squared copula
		families in Nasri (2020) doi:10.1016/j.spl.2020.108704: ncs-
		gaussian, ncs-clayton, ncs-gumbel, ncs-frank, ncs-joe, and ncs-
		plackett. For theoretical details, see, e.g., Nasri and
		Remillard (2023) arXiv:2301.13408.
