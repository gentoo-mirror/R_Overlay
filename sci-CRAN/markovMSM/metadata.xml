		Methods for Checking the Markov Condition in Multi-State Survival
		Data // The inference in multi-state models is traditionally
		performed under a Markov assumption that claims that past and
		future of the process are independent given the present state.
		In this package, we consider tests of the Markov assumption
		that are applicable to general multi-state models. Three
		approaches using existing methodology are considered: a simple
		method based on including covariates depending on the history
		in Cox models for the transition intensities; methods based on
		measuring the discrepancy of the non-Markov estimators of the
		transition probabilities to the Markov Aalen-Johansen
		estimators; and, finally, methods that were developed by
		considering summaries from families of log-rank statistics
		where patients are grouped by the state occupied of the process
		at a particular time point (see Soutinho G, Meira-Machado L
		(2021) doi:10.1007/s00180-021-01139-7 and Titman AC, Putter H
		(2020) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa030).
