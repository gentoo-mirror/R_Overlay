		Solution Paths for Linear and Logistic Regression Models with
		Categorical Predictors, with SCOPE Penalty // Computes
		solutions for linear and logistic regression models with
		potentially high-dimensional categorical predictors. This is
		done by applying a nonconvex penalty (SCOPE) and computing
		solutions in an efficient path-wise fashion. The scaling of the
		solution paths is selected automatically. Includes
		functionality for selecting tuning parameter lambda by k-fold
		cross-validation and early termination based on information
		criteria. Solutions are computed by cyclical block-coordinate
		descent, iterating an innovative dynamic programming algorithm
		to compute exact solutions for each block.
