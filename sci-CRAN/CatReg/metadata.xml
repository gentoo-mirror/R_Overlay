		Solution Paths for Linear and Logistic Regression Models with
		SCOPE Penalty // Computes solutions for linear and logistic
		regression models with a nonconvex penalty (SCOPE) in an
		efficient path-wise fashion. The scaling of the solution paths
		is selected automatically. Includes functionality for selecting
		tuning parameter lambda by k-fold cross-validation and early
		termination based on information criteria. Solutions are
		computed by cyclical block-coordinate descent, iterating an
		innovative dynamic programming algorithm to compute exact
		solutions for each block.
