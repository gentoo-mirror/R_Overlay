		Tokenization, Parts of Speech Tagging, Lemmatization and
		Dependency Parsing with the 'UDPipe' 'NLP' Toolkit // This
		natural language processing toolkit provides language-agnostic
		'tokenization', 'parts of speech tagging', 'lemmatization' and
		'dependency parsing' of raw text. Next to text parsing, the
		package also allows you to train annotation models based on
		data of 'treebanks' in 'CoNLL-U' format as provided at
		https://universaldependencies.org/format.html. The techniques
		are explained in detail in the paper: 'Tokenizing, POS Tagging,
		Lemmatizing and Parsing UD 2.0 with UDPipe', available at
		doi:10.18653/v1/K17-3009. The toolkit also contains
		functionalities for commonly used data manipulations on texts
		which are enriched with the output of the parser. Namely
		functionalities and algorithms for collocations, token co-
		occurrence, document term matrix handling, term frequency
		inverse document frequency calculations, information retrieval
		metrics (Okapi BM25), handling of multi-word expressions,
		keyword detection (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction, noun
		phrase extraction, syntactical patterns) sentiment scoring and
		semantic similarity analysis.
