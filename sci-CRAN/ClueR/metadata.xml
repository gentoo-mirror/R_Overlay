		computational method for identifying optimal number of clusters
		in a given time-course dataset clustered by cmeans or kmeans
		algorithms and subsequently identify key kinases or pathways
		from each cluster. Its implementation in R is called ClueR. See
		README on https://github.com/PYangLab/ClueR for more details. P
