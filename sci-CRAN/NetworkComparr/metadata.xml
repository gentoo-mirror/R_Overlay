		Statistical Comparison of Networks // A permutation-based
		hypothesis test for statistical comparison of two networks
		based on the invariance measures of the R package
		'NetworkComparisonTest' by van Borkulo et al. (2022),
		doi:10.1037/met0000476: network structure invariance, global
		strength invariance, edge invariance, and various centrality
		measures. Edgelists from dependent or independent samples are
		used as input. These edgelists are generated from concept maps
		and summed into two comparable group networks. The networks can
		be directed or undirected.
