		Feasible Estimation of the Two-Way Fixed Effect Model //
		Implemented is an algorithm to estimate the two-way fixed
		effect linear model. The coefficients of interest are computed
		using the residuals from the projection of all variables on the
		two sets of fixed effects. Our algorithm has three desirable
		features. First, it manages memory and computational resources
		efficiently which speeds up the computation of the estimates.
		Second, it allows the researcher to estimate multiple
		specifications using the same set of fixed effects at a very
		low computational cost. Third, the asymptotic variance of the
		parameters of interest can be consistently estimated using
		standard routines on the residualized data. Somaini P., Wolak
