		Functions for the Analysis of Star Trek Thematic Data // An
		implementation of 1) the hypergeometric test for over-
		representation of literary themes in a storyset (a list of
		stories) relative to a background list of stories, and 2) a
		recommendation system that takes a user-selected story as input
		and returns a ranked list of similar stories on the basis of
		shared themes. The package is currently implemented for the
		episodes of the Star Trek television franchise series The
		Original Series (TOS), The Animated Series (TAS), The Next
		Generation (TNG), and Voyager (VOY).
