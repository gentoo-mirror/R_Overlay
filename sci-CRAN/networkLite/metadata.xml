		An Simplified Implementation of the 'network' Package
		Functionality // An implementation of some of the core
		'network' package functionality based on a simplified data
		structure that is faster in many research applications. This
		package is designed for back-end use in the 'statnet' family of
		packages, including 'EpiModel'. Support is provided for binary
		and weighted, directed and undirected, bipartite and unipartite
		networks; no current support for multigraphs, hypergraphs, or
		loops.
