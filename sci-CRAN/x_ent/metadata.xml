		eXtraction of ENTity // Provides a tool for extracting
		information (entities and relations between them) in text
		datasets. It also emphasizes the results exploration with
		graphical displays. It is a rule-based system and works with
		hand-made dictionaries and local grammars defined by users.
		'x.ent' uses parsing with Perl functions and JavaScript to
		define user preferences through a browser and R to display and
		support analysis of the results extracted. Local grammars are
		defined and compiled with the tool Unitex, a tool developed by
		University Paris Est that supports multiple languages. See
		?xconfig for an introduction.
