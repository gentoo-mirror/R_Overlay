		Dynamic Aggregation Testing // A multiple testing procedure aims
		to find the rare-variant association regions. When variants are
		rare, the single variant association test approach suffers from
		low power. To improve testing power, the procedure dynamically
		and hierarchically aggregates smaller genome regions to larger
		ones and performs multiple testing for disease associations
		with a controlled node-level false discovery rate. This method
		are members of the family of ancillary information assisted
		recursive testing introduced in Pura, Li, Chan and Xie (2021)
		arXiv:1906.07757v2 and Li, Sung and Xie (2021)
		arXiv:2103.11085v2.
