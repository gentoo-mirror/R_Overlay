		A Boosted Tweedie Compound Poisson Model // An implementation of
		a boosted Tweedie compound Poisson model proposed by Yang, Y.,
		Qian, W. and Zou, H. (2018) doi:10.1080/07350015.2016.1200981.
		It is capable of fitting a flexible nonlinear Tweedie compound
		Poisson model (or a gamma model) and capturing high-order
		interactions among predictors. This package is based on the
		'gbm' package originally developed by Greg Ridgeway.
