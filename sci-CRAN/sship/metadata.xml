		Tool for Secure Shipment of Content // Convenient tools for
		exchanging files securely from within R. By encrypting the
		content safe passage of files (shipment) can be provided by
		common but insecure carriers such as ftp and email. Based on
		asymmetric cryptography no management of shared secrets is
		needed to make a secure shipment as long as authentic public
		keys are available. Public keys used for secure shipments may
		also be obtained from external providers as part of the overall
		process. Transportation of files will require that relevant
		services such as ftp and email servers are available.
