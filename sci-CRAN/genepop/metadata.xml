		Population Genetic Data Analysis Using Genepop // Makes the
		Genepop software available in R. This software implements a
		mixture of traditional population genetic methods and some more
		focused developments: it computes exact tests for Hardy-
		Weinberg equilibrium, for population differentiation and for
		genotypic disequilibrium among pairs of loci; it computes
		estimates of F-statistics, null allele frequencies, allele
		size-based statistics for microsatellites, etc.; and it
		performs analyses of isolation by distance from pairwise
		comparisons of individuals or population samples.
