		Sequential Normal Scores in Statistical Process Management // The
		methods discussed in this package are new non-parametric
		methods based on sequential normal scores 'SNS' (Conover et al
		(2017) doi:10.1080/07474946.2017.1360091), designed for
		sequences of observations, usually time series data, which may
		occur singly or in batches, and may be univariate or
		multivariate. These methods are designed to detect changes in
		the process, which may occur as changes in location (mean or
		median), changes in scale (standard deviation, or variance), or
		other changes of interest in the distribution of the
		observations, over the time observed. They usually apply to
		large data sets, so computations need to be simple enough to be
		done in a reasonable time on a computer, and easily updated as
		each new observation (or batch of observations) becomes
		available. Some examples and more detail in 'SNS' is presented
		in the work by Conover et al (2019) arXiv:1901.04443.
