		Spatially and Temporally Varying Coefficient Models Using
		Generalized Additive Models // A framework for specifying
		spatially, temporally and spatially-and-temporally varying
		coefficient models using Generalized Additive Models with
		Gaussian Process smooths. The smooths are parameterised with
		location and / or time attributes. Importantly the framework
		supports the investigation of the presence and nature of any
		space-time dependencies in the data, allows the user to
		evaluate different model forms (specifications) and to pick the
		most probable model or to combine multiple varying coefficient
		models using Bayesian Model Averaging. For more details see:
