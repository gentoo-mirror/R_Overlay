		Spatially and Temporally Varying Coefficient Models Using
		Generalized Additive Models // A framework for specifying
		spatially, temporally and spatially-and-temporally varying
		coefficient models using Generalized Additive Models with
		smooths. The smooths are parameterised with location, time and
		predictor variables. The framework supports the investigation
		of the presence and nature of any space-time dependencies in
		the data by evaluating multiple model forms (specifications)
		using a Generalized Cross-Validation score. The workflow
		sequence is to: i) Prepare the data by lengthening it to have a
		single location and time variables for each observation. ii)
		Evaluate all possible spatial and/or temporal models in which
		each predictor is specified in different ways. iii) Evaluate
		each model and pick the best one. iv) Create the final model.
		v) Calculate the varying coefficient estimates to quantify how
		the relationships between the target and predictor variables
		vary over space, time or space-time. vi) Create maps, time
		series plots etc. For more details see: Comber et al (2023)
