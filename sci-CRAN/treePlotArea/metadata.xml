		Correction Factors for Tree Plot Areas Intersected by Stand
		Boundaries // The German national forest inventory uses angle
		count sampling, a sampling method first published as
		`Bitterlich, W.: Die Winkelzhlmessung. Allgemeine Forst- und
		Holzwirtschaftliche Zeitung, 58. Jahrg., Folge 11/12 vom Juni
		1947` and extended by Grosenbaugh
		(https://academic.oup.com/jof/article-abstract/50/1/32/4684174)
		as probability proportional to size sampling. When plots are
		located near stand boundaries, their sizes and hence their
		probabilities need to be corrected.
