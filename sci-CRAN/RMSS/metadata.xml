		Robust Multi-Model Subset Selection // Efficient algorithms for
		generating ensembles of robust, sparse and diverse models via
		robust multi-model subset selection (RMSS). The robust
		ensembles are generated by minimizing the sum of the least
		trimmed square loss of the models in the ensembles under
		constraints  for the size of the models and the sharing of the
		predictors. Tuning parameters for the robustness, sparsity and
		diversity of the robust ensemble are selected by cross-
		validation.
