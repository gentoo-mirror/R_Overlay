		A System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil
		Surveys // Taxonomic dictionaries, formative element lists, and
		functions related to the maintenance, development and
		application of U.S. Soil Taxonomy. Data and functionality are

		Information System or Soil Survey Geographic databases. Other
		sources are referenced in the data documentation. Provides
		tools for understanding and interacting with concepts in the
