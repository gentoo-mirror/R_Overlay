		Interpolating Age-Specific Mortality Rates at All Ages //
		Mortality Rates are usually published following an abridged
		description, i.e., by age groups 0, [1, 5[, [5, 10[, [10, 15[
		and so on. For some applications, a detailed (single) ages
		description is required. Despite the huge number of the
		proposed methods in the literature, there is a limited number
		of methods ensuring a high performance at lower and higher ages
		in the same time. For example, the 6-terms 'Lagrange'
		interpolation function is well adapted to mortality
		interpolation at lower ages (with unequal intervals) but is not
		adapted to higher ages. On the other hand, the 'Karup-King'
		method allows a good performance at higher ages but not adapted
		to lower ages. Interested readers can refer to the book of
		Shryock, Siegel and Associates (1993) for a detailed overview
		of the two cited methods.The package Q2q allows combining both
		the two methods to allow interpolating mortality rates at all
		ages. First, it starts by implementing each method separately,
		then the resulted curves are joined based on a 5-age averaged
		error between the two curves.
