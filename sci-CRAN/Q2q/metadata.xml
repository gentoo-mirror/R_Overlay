		Interpolating Age-Specific Mortality Rates at All Ages //
		Mortality rates are typically provided in an abridged format,
		i.e., by age groups 0, [1, 5], [5, 10]', '[10, 15]', and so on.
		Some applications necessitate a detailed (single) age
		description. Despite the large number of proposed approaches in
		the literature, only a few methods ensure great performance at
		both younger and higher ages. For example, the 6-term
		'Lagrange' interpolation function is well suited to mortality
		interpolation at younger ages (with irregular intervals), but
		not at older ages. The 'Karup-King' method, on the other hand,
		performs well at older ages but is not suitable for younger
		ones. Interested readers can find a full discussion of the two
		stated methods in the book Shryock, Siegel, and Associates
		(1993).The Q2q package combines the two methods to allow for
		the interpolation of mortality rates across all age groups. It
		begins by implementing each method independently, and then the
		resulting curves are linked using a 5-age averaged error
		between the two partial curves.
