		Poisson-Gamma Additive Models. // This work is an extension of
		the state space model for Poisson count data, Poisson-Gamma
		model, towards a semiparametric specification. Just like the
		generalized additive models (GAM), cubic splines are used for
		covariate smoothing. The semiparametric models are fitted by an
		iterative process that combines maximization of likelihood and
		backfitting algorithm.
