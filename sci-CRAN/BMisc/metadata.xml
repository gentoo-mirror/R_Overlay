		Miscellaneous Functions for Panel Data, Quantiles, and Printing
		Results // These are miscellaneous functions for working with
		panel data, quantiles, and printing results.  For panel data,
		the package includes functions for making a panel data balanced
		(that is, dropping missing individuals that have missing
		observations in any time period), converting id numbers to row
		numbers, and to treat repeated cross sections as panel data
		under the assumption of rank invariance.  For quantiles, there
		are functions to make distribution functions from a set of data
		points (this is particularly useful when a distribution
		function is created in several steps), to combine distribution
		functions based on some external weights, and to invert
		distribution functions.  Finally, there are several other
		miscellaneous functions for obtaining weighted means, weighted
		distribution functions, and weighted quantiles; to generate
		summary statistics and their differences for two groups; and to
		add or drop covariates from formulas.
