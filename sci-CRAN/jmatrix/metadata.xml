		Read from/Write to Disk Matrices with any Data Type in a Binary
		Format // A mainly instrumental package meant to allow other
		packages whose core is written in 'C++' to read, write and
		manipulate matrices in a binary format so that the memory used
		for them is no more than strictly needed. Its functionality is
		already inside 'parallelpam' and 'scellpam', so if you have
		installed any of these, you do not need to install 'jmatrix'.
		Using just the needed memory is not always true with 'R'
		matrices or vectors, since by default they are of double type.
		Trials like the 'float' package have been done, but to use them
		you have to coerce a matrix already loaded in 'R' memory to a
		float matrix, and then you can delete it. The problem comes
		when your computer has not memory enough to hold the matrix in
		the first place, so you are forced to load it by chunks. This
		is the problem this package tries to address (with partial
		success, but this is a difficult problem since 'R' is not a
		strictly typed language, which is anyway quite hard to get in
		an interpreted language). This package allows the creation and
		manipulation of full, sparse and symmetric matrices of any
		standard data type.
