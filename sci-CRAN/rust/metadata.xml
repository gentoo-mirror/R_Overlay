		Ratio-of-Uniforms Simulation with Transformation // Uses the
		generalized ratio-of-uniforms (RU) method to simulate from
		univariate and (low-dimensional) multivariate continuous
		distributions. The user specifies the log-density, up to an
		additive constant. The RU algorithm is applied after relocation
		of mode of the density to zero, and the user can choose a
		tuning parameter r. For details see Wakefield, Gelfand and
		Smith (1991) DOI:10.1007/BF01889987, Efficient generation of
		random variates via the ratio-of-uniforms method, Statistics
		and Computing (1991) 1, 129-133.  A Box-Cox variable
		transformation can be used to make the input density suitable
		for the RU method and to improve efficiency.  In the
		multivariate case rotation of axes can also be used to improve
		efficiency. From version 1.2.0 the 'Rcpp' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp can be used to improve
		efficiency.
