		Estimate Split-Half Reliabilities // Estimates split-half
		reliabilities for scoring algorithms of cognitive tasks and
		questionnaires. The 'splithalfr' supports researcher-provided
		scoring algorithms, with six vignettes illustrating how on
		included datasets. The package provides four splitting methods
		(first-second, odd-even, permutated, Monte Carlo), the option
		to stratify splits by task design, a number of reliability
		coefficients, and the option to sub-sample data.
