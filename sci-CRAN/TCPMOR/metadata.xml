		Two Cut-Points with Maximum Odds Ratio // Enables the computation
		of the 'two cut-points with maximum odds ratio (OR) value
		method' for data analysis, particularly suited for binary
		classification tasks. Users can identify optimal cut-points in
		a continuous variable by maximizing the odds ratio while
		maintaining an equal risk level, useful for tasks such as
		medical diagnostics, risk assessment, or predictive modeling.
