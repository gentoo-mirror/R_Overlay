		Methods for Calculating 'EQ-5D' Utility Index Scores // EQ-5D is
		a popular health related quality of life instrument used in the
		clinical and economic evaluation of health care. Developed by
		the EuroQol group https://euroqol.org/, the instrument consists
		of two components: health state description and evaluation. For
		the description component a subject self-rates their health in
		terms of five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual
		activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using
		either a three-level (EQ-5D-3L,
		https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-3l-about/) or a
		five-level (EQ-5D-5L,
		https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about/) scale.
		Frequently the scores on these five dimensions are converted to
		a single utility index using country specific value sets, which
		can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health
		care as well as in population health surveys. The eq5d package
		provides methods to calculate index scores from a subject's
		dimension scores. 26 TTO and 11 VAS EQ-5D-3L value sets
		including those for countries in Szende et al (2007)
		doi:10.1007/1-4020-5511-0 and Szende et al (2014)
		doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7596-1, 25 EQ-5D-5L EQ-VT value sets
		from the EuroQol website, and the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk value sets
		developed by van Hout et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008 are included. Additionally, a
		shiny web tool is included to enable the calculation,
		visualisation and automated statistical analysis of EQ-5D index
		values via a web browser using EQ-5D dimension scores stored in
		CSV or Excel files.
