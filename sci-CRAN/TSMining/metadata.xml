		Mining Univariate and Multivariate Motifs in Time-Series Data //
		Implementations of a number of functions used to mine numeric
		time-series data. It covers the implementation of SAX
		transformation, univariate motif discovery (based on the random
		projection method), multivariate motif discovery (based on
		graph clustering), and several functions used for the ease of
		visualizing the motifs discovered. The details of SAX
		transformation can be found in J. Lin. E. Keogh, L. Wei, S.
		Lonardi, Experiencing SAX: A novel symbolic representation of
		time series, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 15 (2) (2007)
		107-144. Details on univariate motif discovery method
		implemented can be found in B. Chiu, E. Keogh, S. Lonardi,
		Probabilistic discovery of time series motifs, ACM SIGKDD,
		Washington, DC, USA, 2003, pp. 493-498. Details on the
		multivariate motif discovery method implemented can be found in
		A. Vahdatpour, N. Amini, M. Sarrafzadeh, Towards unsupervised
		activity discovery using multi-dimensional motif detection in
		time series, IJCAI 2009 21st International Joint Conference on
		Artificial Intelligence.
