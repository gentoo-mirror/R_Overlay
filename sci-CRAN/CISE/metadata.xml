		Common and Individual Structure Explained for Multiple Graphs //
		Specific dimension reduction methods for replicated graphs
		(multiple undirected graphs repeatedly measured on a common set
		of nodes). The package contains efficient procedures for
		estimating a shared baseline propensity matrix and graph-
		specific low rank matrices. The algorithm uses block coordinate
		descent algorithm to solve the model, which alternatively
		performs L2-penalized logistic regression and multiple partial
		eigenvalue decompositions, as described in the paper Wang et
		al. (2017) arXiv:1707.06360.
