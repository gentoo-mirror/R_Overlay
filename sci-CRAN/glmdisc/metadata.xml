		Discretization and Grouping for Logistic Regression // A
		Stochastic-Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm (Celeux et
		al. (1995) https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00074164) associated with
		a Gibbs sampler which purpose is to learn a constrained
		representation for logistic regression that is called
		quantization (Ehrhardt et al. (2019) arXiv:1903.08920).
		Continuous features are discretized and categorical features'
		values are grouped to produce a better logistic regression
		model. Pairwise interactions between quantized features are
		dynamically added to the model through a Metropolis-Hastings
		algorithm (Hastings, W. K. (1970) doi:10.1093/biomet/57.1.97).
