		Addressing Detection Limits by Cumulative Probability Models
		(CPMs) // Build CPMs (cumulative probability models, also known
		as cumulative link models) to account for detection limits
		(both single and multiple detection limits) in response
		variables. Conditional quantiles and conditional CDFs can be
		calculated based on fitted models. The package implements
		methods described in Tian, Y., Li, C., Tu, S., James, N. T.,
		Harrell, F. E.,  Shepherd, B. E. (2022). "Addressing Detection
		Limits with Semiparametric Cumulative Probability Models".
