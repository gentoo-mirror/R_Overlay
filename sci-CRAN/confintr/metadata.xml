		Confidence Intervals // Calculates classic and/or bootstrap
		confidence intervals for many parameters such as the population
		mean, variance, interquartile range (IQR), median absolute
		deviation (MAD), skewness, kurtosis, Cramer's V, R-squared,
		quantiles (incl. median), proportions, different types of
		correlation measures, difference in means, quantiles and
		medians. Many of the classic confidence intervals are described
		in Smithson, M. (2003, ISBN: 978-0761924999). Bootstrap
		confidence intervals are calculated with the R package 'boot'.
		Both one- and two-sided intervals are supported.
