		ISO11784 PIT Tag ID Format Converters // Some tools to assist
		with converting International Organization for Standardization
		(ISO) standard 11784 (ISO11784) animal ID codes between 4
		recognised formats commonly displayed on Passive Integrated
		Transponder (PIT) tag readers. The most common formats are 15
		digit decimal, e.g., 999123456789012, and 13 character
		hexadecimal 'dot' format, e.g., 3E7.1CBE991A14. These are
		referred to in this package as isodecimal and isodothex. The
		other two formats are the raw hexadecimal representation of the
		ISO11784 binary structure (see
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_11784_and_ISO_11785). There
		are two 'flavours' of this format, a left and a right
		variation. Which flavour a reader happens to output depends on
		if the developers decided to reverse the binary number or not
		before converting to hexadecimal, a decision based on the fact
		that the PIT tags will transmit their binary code Least
		Significant Bit (LSB) first, or backwards basically.
