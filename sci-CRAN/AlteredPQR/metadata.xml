		Detection of Altered Protein Quantitative Relationships //
		Inference of protein complex states from quantitative
		proteomics data. The package takes information on known stable
		protein interactions (i.e. protein components of the same
		complex) and assesses how protein quantitative ratios change
		between different conditions. It reports protein pairs for
		which relative protein quantities to each other have been
		significantly altered in the tested condition.
