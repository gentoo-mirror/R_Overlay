		Evidential Regression // An implementation of the 'Evidential
		Neural Network for Regression' model recently introduced in
		Denoeux (2023) doi:10.1109/TFUZZ.2023.3268200. In this model,
		prediction uncertainty is quantified by Gaussian random fuzzy
		numbers as introduced in Denoeux (2023)
		doi:10.1016/j.fss.2022.06.004. The package contains functions
		for training the network, tuning hyperparameters by cross-
		validation or the hold-out method, and making predictions. It
		also contains utilities for making calculations with Gaussian
		random fuzzy numbers (such as, e.g., computing the degrees of
		belief and plausibility of an interval, or combining Gaussian
		random fuzzy numbers).
