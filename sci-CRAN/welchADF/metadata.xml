		Welch-James Statistic for Robust Hypothesis Testing under
		Heterocedasticity and Non-Normality // Implementation of
		Johansen's general formulation of Welch-James's statistic with
		Approximate Degrees of Freedom, which makes it suitable for
		testing any linear hypothesis concerning cell means in
		univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when the data
		pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Some
		improvements, namely trimmed means and Winsorized variances,
		and bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical value,
		have been added to the classical formulation. The code departs
		from a previous SAS implementation by L.M. Lix and H.J.
		Keselman, available at
		http://homepage.usask.ca/~lml321/Program.pdf and published in
		Keselman, H.J., Wilcox, R.R., and Lix, L.M. (2003)
		DOI:10.1111/1469-8986.00060.
