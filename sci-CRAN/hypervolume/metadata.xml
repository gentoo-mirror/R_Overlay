		High Dimensional Geometry, Set Operations, Projection, and
		Inference Using Kernel Density Estimation, Support Vector
		Machines, and Convex Hulls // Estimates the shape and volume of
		high-dimensional datasets and performs set operations:
		intersection / overlap, union, unique components, inclusion
		test, and hole detection. Uses stochastic geometry approach to
		high-dimensional kernel density estimation, support vector
		machine delineation, and convex hull generation. Applications
		include modeling trait and niche hypervolumes and species
		distribution modeling.
