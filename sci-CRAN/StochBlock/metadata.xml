		Stochastic Blockmodeling of One-Mode and Linked Networks //
		Stochastic blockmodeling of one-mode and linked networks as
		implemented in kulj and iberna (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.001. The optimization is done via
		CEM (Classification Expectation Maximization) algorithm that
		can be initialized by random partitions or the results of
		k-means algorithm. The development of this package is
		financially supported by the Slovenian Research Agency
		(https://www.arrs.si/) within the research programs P5-0168 and
		the research projects J7-8279 (Blockmodeling multilevel and
		temporal networks) and J5-2557 (Comparison and evaluation of
		different approaches to blockmodeling dynamic networks by
		simulations with application to Slovenian co-authorship
		networks).
