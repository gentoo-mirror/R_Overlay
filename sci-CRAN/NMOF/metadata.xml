		Numerical Methods and Optimization in Finance // Functions,
		examples and data from the first and the second edition of
		"Numerical Methods and Optimization in Finance" by M. Gilli, D.
		Maringer and E. Schumann (2019, ISBN:978-0128150658).  The
		package provides implementations of optimisation heuristics
		(Differential Evolution, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm
		Optimisation, Simulated Annealing and Threshold Accepting), and
		other optimisation tools, such as grid search and greedy
		search. There are also functions for the valuation of financial
		instruments, such as bonds and options, and functions that help
		with stochastic simulations.
