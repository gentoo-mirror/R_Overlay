		Numerical Methods and Optimization in Finance // Functions,
		examples and data from the book "Numerical Methods and
		Optimization in Finance" by M. Gilli, D. Maringer and E.
		Schumann (2011), ISBN 978-0123756626. The package provides
		implementations of several optimisation heuristics, such as
		Differential Evolution, Genetic Algorithms and Threshold
		Accepting. There are also functions for the valuation of
		financial instruments, such as bonds and options, and functions
		that help with stochastic simulations.
