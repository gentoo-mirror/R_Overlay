		Analyzing Gene Tree Quartets under the Multi-Species Coalescent
		// Methods for analyzing and using quartets displayed on a
		collection of gene trees, primarily to make inferences about
		the species tree or network under the multi-species coalescent
		model. These include quartet hypothesis tests for the model, as
		developed by Mitchell et al. (2019) doi:10.1214/19-EJS1576, the
		species tree inference routines based on quartet distances of
		Rhodes (2019) doi:10.1109/TCBB.2019.2917204 and Yourdkhani and
		Rhodes (2019), and the NANUQ algorithm for inference of level-1
		species networks of Allman et al. (2019) arXiv:1905.07050.
