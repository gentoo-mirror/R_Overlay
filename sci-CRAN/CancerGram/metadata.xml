		Prediction of Anticancer Peptides // Predicts anticancer peptides
		using random forests trained on the n-gram encoded peptides.
		The implemented algorithm can be accessed from both the command
		line and shiny-based GUI. The CancerGram model is too large for
		CRAN and it has to be downloaded separately from the
		repository: https://github.com/BioGenies/CancerGramModel. For
		more information see: Burdukiewicz et al. (2020)
