		'ggplot2' Based Plots with Statistical Details // Extension of
		'ggplot2', 'ggstatsplot' creates graphics with details from
		statistical tests included in the plots themselves. It provides
		an easier API to generate information-rich plots for
		statistical analysis of continuous (violin plots, scatterplots,
		histograms, dot plots, dot-and-whisker plots) or categorical
		(pie and bar charts) data. Currently, it supports the most
		common types of statistical approaches and tests: parametric,
		nonparametric, robust, and Bayesian versions of t-test/ANOVA,
		correlation analyses, contingency table analysis, meta-
		analysis, and regression analyses.
