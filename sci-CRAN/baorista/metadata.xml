		Bayesian Aoristic Analyses // Provides an alternative approach to
		aoristic analyses for archaeological datasets by fitting
		Bayesian parametric growth models and non-parametric random-
		walk Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive (ICAR) models on time
		frequency data (Crema (2024)doi:10.1111/arcm.12984). It handles
		event typo-chronology based timespans defined by start/end date
		as well as more complex user-provided vector of probabilities.
