		An Adaptive Sum of Powered Correlation Test (aSPC) for Global
		Association Between Two Random Vectors // The aSPC test is
		designed to test global association between two groups of
		variables potentially with moderate to high dimension (e.g. in
		hundreds). The aSPC is particularly useful when the association
		signals between two groups of variables are sparse.
