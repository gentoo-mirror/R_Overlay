		Bayesian Network Belief Propagation // Belief propagation methods
		in Bayesian Networks to propagate evidence through the network.
		The implementation of these methods are based on the article:
		Cowell, RG (2005). Local Propagation in Conditional Gaussian
		Bayesian Networks
		http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/cowell05a/. For details
		please see Yu et. al. (2020) BayesNetBP: An R Package for
		Probabilistic Reasoning in Bayesian Networks
		doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i03. The optional 'cyjShiny' package for
		running the Shiny app is available at
		https://github.com/cytoscape/cyjShiny. Please see the example
		in the documentation of 'runBayesNetApp' function for
		installing 'cyjShiny' package from GitHub.
