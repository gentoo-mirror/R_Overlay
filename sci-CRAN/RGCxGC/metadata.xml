		Preprocessing and Multivariate Analysis of Bidimensional Gas
		Chromatography Data // Implementation of chemometrics analysis
		for bidimensional gas chromatography data. This package can
		handle data for common scientific data format (netCDF) and fold
		it to 2D chromatogram. Then, it can perform preprocessing and
		multivariate analysis. In the preprocessing algorithms,
		baseline correction, smoothing, and peak alignment are
		available. While in multivariate analysis, multiway principal
		component analysis is incorporated.
