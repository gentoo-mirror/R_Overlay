		A Modified Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MSPRT) // Given the
		maximum available sample size (N) for an experiment, and the
		target levels of Type I and II error probabilities, this
		package designs a modified SPRT (MSPRT). For any designed MSPRT
		the package can also obtain its operating characteristics and
		implement the test for a given sequentially observed data. The
		MSPRT is defined in a manner very similar to Wald's initial
		proposal. The proposed test has shown evidence of reducing the
		average sample size required to perform statistical hypothesis
		tests at specified levels of significance and power. Currently,
		the package implements one-sample proportion tests, one and
		two-sample z tests, and one and two-sample t tests. A brief
		user guidance for this package is provided below. One can also
		refer to the supplemental information for the same.
