		Modified Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MSPRT) // A modified
		SPRT (MSPRT) can be designed and implemented with the help of
		this package. In a MSPRT design, the maximum sample size of an
		experiment is fixed prior to the start of an experiment, the
		alternative hypothesis used to define the rejection region of
		the test is derived from the size of the test (Type I error),
		the maximum available sample size (N), and the targeted Type 2
		error (equal to 1 minus the power) is also prespecified. Given
		these values, the MSPRT is defined in a manner very similar to
		Wald's initial proposal. This test can reduce the average
		sample size required to perform statistical hypothesis tests at
		the specified levels of significance and power. This package
		facilitates the carrying out of one sample Z tests, T Tests and
		tests of binomial success probabilities. A user guidance for
		this software package is provided here and also in the
		supplemental information.
