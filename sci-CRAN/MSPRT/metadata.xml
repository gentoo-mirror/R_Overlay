		A Modified Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MSPRT) // A
		modified SPRT (MSPRT) can be designed and implemented with the
		help of this package. In a MSPRT design, (i) the maximum sample
		size of an experiment is fixed prior to the start of an
		experiment; (ii) the alternative hypothesis used to define the
		rejection region of the test is derived from the size of the
		test (Type I error), the maximum available sample size (N), and
		(iii) the targeted Type 2 error (equals to 1 minus the power)
		is also prespecified. Given these values, the MSPRT is defined
		in a manner very similar to Wald's initial proposal. This test
		can reduce the average sample size required to perform
		statistical hypothesis tests at the specified level of
		significance and power. This package implements one-sample
		proportion tests, one-sample Z-tests, one-sample T-tests, two-
		sample Z-tests and two-sample T-tests. A user guidance for this
		package is provided here. One can also refer to the
		supplemental information for the same.
