		Parsimonious Mixtures of MSEN and MTIN Distributions //
		Implements parsimonious mixtures of MSEN and MTIN distributions
		via expectation- maximization based algorithms for model-based
		clustering. For each mixture component, parsimony is reached
		via the eigen-decomposition of the scale matrices and by
		imposing a constraint on the tailedness parameter. This
		produces a family of 28 parsimonious mixture models for each
		distribution.
