		Implementation of Case-Control Optimal Matching // Cases are
		matched to controls in an efficient, optimal and
		computationally flexible way. It uses the idea of sub-sampling
		in the level of the case, by creating pseudo-observations of
		controls. The user can select between replacement and without
		replacement, the number of controls, and several covariates to
		match upon. See Mamouris (2021) doi:10.1186/s12874-021-01256-3
		for an overview.
