		Models Hurricane Wind Speed, Wind Direction, and Wind Damage //
		The HURRECON model estimates wind speed, wind direction,
		enhanced Fujita scale wind damage, and duration of EF0 to EF5
		winds as a function of hurricane location and maximum sustained
		wind speed. Results may be generated for a single site or an
		entire region. Hurricane track and intensity data may be
		imported directly from the US National Hurricane Center's
		HURDAT2 database. For details on the original version of the
		model written in Borland Pascal, see: Boose, Chamberlin, and
		Foster (2001)
		doi:10.1890/0012-9615(2001)071[0027:LARIOH]2.0.CO;2 and Boose,
		Serrano, and Foster (2004) doi:10.1890/02-4057.
