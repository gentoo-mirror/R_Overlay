		Interface Utilities, Model Templates, Parallel Computing Methods
		and Additional Distributions for MCMC Models in JAGS // User-
		friendly interface utilities for MCMC models via Just Another
		Gibbs Sampler (JAGS), facilitating the use of parallel (or
		distributed) processors for multiple chains, automated control
		of convergence and sample length diagnostics, and evaluation of
		the performance of a model using drop-k validation or against
		simulated data. Template model specifications can be generated
		using a standard lme4-style formula interface to assist users
		less familiar with the BUGS syntax.  A JAGS extension module
		provides additional distributions including the Pareto family
		of distributions, the DuMouchel prior and the half-Cauchy
		prior.
