		Australia Maps // Maps of Australian coastline and administrative
		regions. Data can be drawn or accessed directly as simple
		features objects. Includes simple functions for country or
		state maps of Australia and in-built data sets of
		administrative regions from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
		https://www.abs.gov.au/. Layers include electoral divisions and
		local government areas, simplified from the original sources
		but with sufficient detail to allow mapping of a local
		municipality.
