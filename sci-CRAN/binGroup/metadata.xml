		Evaluation and Experimental Design for Binomial Group Testing //
		Methods for estimation and hypothesis testing of proportions in
		group testing designs: methods for estimating a proportion in a
		single population (assuming sensitivity and specificity equal
		to 1 in designs with equal group sizes), as well as hypothesis
		tests and functions for experimental design for this situation.
		For estimating one proportion or the difference of proportions,
		a number of confidence interval methods are included, which can
		deal with various different pool sizes. Further, regression
		methods are implemented for simple pooling and matrix pooling
		designs. Methods for identification of positive items in group
		testing designs: Optimal testing configurations can be found
		for hierarchical and array-based algorithms. Operating
		characteristics can be calculated for testing configurations
		across a wide variety of situations.
