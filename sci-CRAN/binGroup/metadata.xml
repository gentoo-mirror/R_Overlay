		Evaluation and Experimental Design for Binomial Group Testing //
		Methods for estimation and hypothesis testing of proportions in
		group testing designs: methods for estimating a proportion in a
		single population (assuming sensitivity and specificity equal
		to 1 in designs with equal group sizes), as well as hypothesis
		tests and functions for experimental design for this situation.
		For estimating one proportion or the difference of proportions,
		a number of confidence interval methods are included, which can
		deal with various different pool sizes. Further, regression
		methods are implemented for simple pooling and matrix pooling
		designs. Methods for identification of positive specimens in
		group testing designs: methods for identification of positive
		specimens in a number of group testing algorithms. Hierarchical
		and array-based algorithms are implemented and used to find the
		optimal testing configuration and calculate operating
		characteristics for testing configurations across a wide
		variety of situations.
