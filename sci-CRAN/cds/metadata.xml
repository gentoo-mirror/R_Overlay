		Constrained Dual Scaling for Detecting Response Styles // This is
		an implementation of constrained dual scaling for detecting
		response styles in categorical data, including utility
		functions. The procedure involves adding additional columns to
		the data matrix representing the boundaries between the rating
		categories. The resulting matrix is then doubled and analyzed
		by dual scaling. One-dimensional solutions are sought which
		provide optimal scores for the rating categories. These optimal
		scores are constrained to follow monotone quadratic splines.
		Clusters are introduced within which the response styles can
		vary. The type of response style present in a cluster can be
		diagnosed from the optimal scores for said cluster, and this
		can be used to construct an imputed version of the data set
		which adjusts for response styles.
