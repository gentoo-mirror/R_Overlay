		'Rcpp' Package Illustrating Header-Only Access to 'NLopt' // An
		example package which shows use of 'NLopt' functionality from
		C++ via 'Rcpp' without requiring linking, and relying just on
		'nloptr' thanks to the exporting API added there by Jelmer
		Ypma. This package is a fully functioning, updated, and
		expanded version of the initial example by Julien Chiquet at
		https://github.com/jchiquet/RcppArmadilloNLoptExample also
		containing a large earlier pull request of mine.
