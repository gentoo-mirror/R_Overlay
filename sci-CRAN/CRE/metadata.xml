		Interpretable Subgroups Identification Through Ensemble Learning
		of Causal Rules // Provides an interpretable identification of
		subgroups with heterogeneous causal effect. The heterogeneous
		subgroups are discovered through ensemble learning of causal
		rules. Causal rules are highly interpretable if-then statement
		that recursively partition the features space into
		heterogeneous subgroups. A small number of significant causal
		rules are selected through Stability Selection to control for
		family-wise error rate in the finite sample setting. It
		proposes various estimation methods for the conditional causal
		effects for each discovered causal rule.  It is highly flexible
		and multiple causal estimands and imputation methods are
		implemented.  Lee, K., Bargagli-Stoffi, F. J.,  Dominici, F.
