		Spatial Entropy Measures // The heterogeneity of spatial data
		presenting a finite number of categories can be measured via
		computation of spatial entropy. Functions are available for the
		computation of the main entropy and spatial entropy measures in
		the literature. They include the traditional version of
		Shannon's entropy, Batty's spatial entropy, O'Neill's entropy,
		Li and Reynolds' contagion index, Karlstrom and Ceccato's
		entropy, Leibovici's entropy, Parresol and Edwards' entropy and
		Altieri's entropy. References for all measures can be found
		under the topic 'SpatEntropy'. The package is able to work with
		lattice and point data.
