		Install R Packages with GNU Guix // This 'R' package provides a
		single procedure guix.install(), which allows users to install
		'R' packages via 'Guix' right from within their running 'R'
		session.  If the requested 'R' package does not exist in 'Guix'
		at this time, the package and all its missing dependencies will
		be imported recursively and the generated package definitions
		will be written to ~/.Rguix/packages.scm.  This record of
		imported packages can be used later to reproduce the
		environment, and to add the packages in question to a proper
		'Guix' channel (or 'Guix' itself). guix.install() not only
		supports installing packages from CRAN, but also from
		Bioconductor or even arbitrary 'git' or 'mercurial'
		repositories, replacing the need for installation via
		'devtools'.
