		A Collection of Graphon Estimation Methods // Provides a not-so-
		comprehensive list of methods for estimating graphon, a
		symmetric measurable function, from a single or multiple of
		observed networks. For a detailed introduction on graphon and
		popular estimation techniques, see the paper by Orbanz, P. and
		Roy, D.M.(2014) doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2334607. It also
		contains several auxiliary functions for generating sample
		networks using various network models and graphons.
