		Multiple Hypothesis Testing on an Aggregation Tree Method // An
		implementation of the TEAM algorithm to identify local
		differences between two (e.g. case and control) independent,
		univariate distributions, as described in J Pura, C Chan, and J
		Xie (2019) arXiv:1906.07757. The algorithm is based on
		embedding a multiple-testing procedure on a hierarchical
		structure to identify high-resolution differences between two
		distributions. The hierarchical structure is designed to
		identify strong, short-range differences at lower layers and
		weaker, but long-range differences at increasing layers. TEAM
		yields consistent layer-specific and overall false discovery
		rate control.
