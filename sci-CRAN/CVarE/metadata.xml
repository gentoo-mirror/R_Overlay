		Conditional Variance Estimator for Sufficient Dimension Reduction
		// Implementation of the CVE (Conditional Variance Estimation)
		method proposed by Fertl, L. and Bura, E. (2021)
		arXiv:2102.08782 and the ECVE (Ensemble Conditional Variance
		Estimation) method introduced in Fertl, L. and Bura, E. (2021)
		arXiv:2102.13435. CVE and ECVE are sufficient dimension
		reduction methods in regressions with continuous response and
		predictors. CVE applies to general additive error regression
		models while ECVE generalizes to non-additive error regression
		models. They operate under the assumption that the predictors
		can be replaced by a lower dimensional projection without loss
		of information. It is a semiparametric forward regression model
		based exhaustive sufficient dimension reduction estimation
		method that is shown to be consistent under mild assumptions.
