		Missing Value Imputation for Accelerometer Data // We present a
		statistical method for imputing missing values in accelerometer
		data. The methodology includes both parametric and semi-
		parametric multiple imputation under the zero-inflated Poisson
		lognormal model. It also offers several functions to preprocess
		accelerometer data before imputation. These include detecting
		wear and non-wear time, selecting valid days and subjects, and
		generating plots.
