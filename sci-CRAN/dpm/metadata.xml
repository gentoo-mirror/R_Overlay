		Dynamic Panel Models Fit with Maximum Likelihood // Implements
		the dynamic panel models described by Allison, Williams, and
		Moral-Benito (2017 doi:10.1177/2378023117710578) in R. This
		class of models uses structural equation modeling to specify
		dynamic (lagged dependent variable) models with fixed effects
		for panel data. Additionally, models may have predictors that
		are only weakly exogenous, i.e., are affected by prior values
		of the dependent variable. Options also allow for random
		effects, dropping the lagged dependent variable, and a number
		of other specification choices.
