		Reproducible Integrated Species Distribution Models Across Norway
		using 'INLA' // Integration of disparate datasets is needed in
		order to make efficient use of all available data and thereby
		address the issues currently threatening biodiversity. Data
		integration is a powerful modeling framework which allows us to
		combine these datasets together into a single model, yet retain
		the strengths of each individual dataset. We therefore
		introduce the package, 'intSDM': an R package designed to help
		ecologists develop a reproducible workflow of integrated
		species distribution models, using data both provided from the
		user as well as data obtained freely online. An introduction to
		data integration methods is discussed in Issac, Jarzyna, Keil,
		Dambly, Boersch-Supan, Browning, Freeman, Golding, Guillera-
		Arroita, Henrys, Jarvis, Lahoz-Monfort, Pagel, Pescott,
		Schmucki, Simmonds and OHara (2020)
