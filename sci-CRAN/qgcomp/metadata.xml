		Quantile G-Computation // G-computation for a set of time-fixed
		exposures with quantile-based basis functions, possibly under
		linearity and homogeneity assumptions. This approach estimates
		a regression line corresponding to the expected change in the
		outcome (on the link basis) given a simultaneous increase in
		the quantile-based category for all exposures. Works with
		continuous, binary, and right-censored time-to-event outcomes.
