		Tests on Properties of Space-Time Covariance Functions // Tests
		on properties of space-time covariance functions. Tests on
		symmetry, separability and for assessing different forms of
		non-separability are available. Moreover tests on some classes
		of covariance functions, such that the classes of product-sum
		models, Gneiting models and integrated product models have been
		provided.  It is the companion R package to the paper of
		Cappello C., De Iaco S. and Posa D.
