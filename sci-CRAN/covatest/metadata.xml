		Tests on Properties of Space-Time Covariance Functions // Tests
		on properties of space-time covariance functions. Tests on
		symmetry, separability and for assessing different forms of
		non-separability are available. Moreover tests on some classes
		of covariance functions, such that the classes of product-sum
		models, Gneiting models and integrated product models have been
		provided.  It is the companion R package to the papers of
		Cappello, C., De Iaco, S., Posa, D., 2018, Testing the type of
		non-separability and some classes of space-time covariance
		function models doi:10.1007/s00477-017-1472-2 and Cappello, C.,
		De Iaco, S., Posa, D., 2020, covatest: an R package for
		selecting a class of space-time covariance functions
		doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i01.
