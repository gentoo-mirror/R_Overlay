		Centrality-Based Pathway Enrichment // It aims to find
		significant pathways through network topology information. It
		has several advantages compared with current pathway enrichment
		tools. First, pathway node instead of single gene is taken as
		the basic unit when analysing networks to meet the fact that
		genes must be constructed into complexes to hold normal
		functions. Second, multiple network centrality measures are
		applied simultaneously to measure importance of nodes from
		different aspects to make a full view on the biological system.
		CePa extends standard pathway enrichment methods, which include
		both over-representation analysis procedure and gene-set
		analysis procedure. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt008.
