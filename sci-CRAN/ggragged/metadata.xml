		Ragged Grids for 'ggplot2' // Extend 'ggplot2' facets to panel
		layouts arranged in a grid with ragged edges.
		facet_ragged_rows() groups panels in rows of (potentially)
		varying lengths, facet_ragged_cols() does the same for columns.
		These can be useful, for example, to represent nested or
		partially crossed relationships between faceting variables.
