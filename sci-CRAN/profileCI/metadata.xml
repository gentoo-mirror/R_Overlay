		Profiling a Log-Likelihood to Calculate Confidence Intervals //
		Provides tools for profiling a user-supplied log-likelihood
		function to calculate confidence intervals for model
		parameters. Speed of computation can be improved by adjusting
		the step sizes in the profiling and/or starting the profiling
		from limits based on the approximate large sample normal
		distribution for the maximum likelihood estimator of a
		parameter. The accuracy of the limits can be set by the user. A
		plot method visualises the log-likelihood and confidence
		interval. Cases where the profile log-likelihood flattens above
		the value at which a confidence limit is defined can be
		handled, leading to a limit at plus or minus infinity. Disjoint
		confidence intervals will not be found.
