		Model Averaging-Assisted Optimal Transfer Learning // Transfer
		learning, as a prevailing technique in computer sciences, aims
		to improve the performance of a target model by leveraging
		auxiliary information from heterogeneous source data. We
		provide novel tools for multi-source transfer learning under
		statistical models based on model averaging strategies,
		including linear regression models, partially linear models.
		Unlike existing transfer learning approaches, this method
		integrates the auxiliary information through data-driven weight
		assignments to avoid negative transfer. This is the first
		package for transfer learning based on the optimal model
		averaging frameworks, providing efficient implementations for
		practitioners in multi-source data modeling. The details are
		described in Hu and Zhang (2023)
