		Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Whitening // Provides
		functions to standardize and whiten data, and to perform
		Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  The main advantage of this
		package over alternatives like prcomp() is, that jvcoords makes
		it easy to convert (additional) data between the original and
		the transformed coordinates.  The package also provides a class
		coords, which can represent affine coordinate transformations.
		This class forms the basis of the transformations provided by
		the package, but can also be used independently.  The
		implementation has been optimized to be of comparable speed
		(and sometimes even faster) than existing alternatives.
