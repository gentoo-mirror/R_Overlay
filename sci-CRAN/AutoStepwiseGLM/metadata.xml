		Builds Stepwise GLMs via Train and Test Approach // Randomly
		splits data into testing and training sets. Then, uses stepwise
		selection to fit numerous multiple regression models on the
		training data, and tests them on the test data. Returned for
		each model are plots comparing model Akaike Information
		Criterion (AIC), Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between
		the predicted and actual values, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and
		R-Squared among the models. Each model is ranked relative to
		the other models by the model evaluation metrics (i.e., AIC, r,
		MAE, and R-Squared) and the model with the best mean ranking
		among the model evaluation metrics is returned. Model
		evaluation metric weights for AIC, r, MAE, and R-Squared are
		taken in as arguments as aic_wt, r_wt, mae_wt, and r_squ_wt,
		respectively. They are equally weighted as default but may be
		adjusted relative to each other if the user prefers one or more
		metrics to the others, Field, A. (2013,
		ISBN:978-1-4462-4918-5).
