		Imputation of High-Dimensional Count Data using Side Information
		// Analysis, imputation, and multiple imputation of count data
		using covariates. LORI uses a log-linear Poisson model where
		main row and column effects, as well as effects of known
		covariates and interaction terms can be fitted. The estimation
		procedure is based on the convex optimization of the Poisson
		loss penalized by a Lasso type penalty and a nuclear norm. LORI
		returns estimates of main effects, covariate effects and
		interactions, as well as an imputed count table. The package
		also contains a multiple imputation procedure. The methods are
		described in Robin, Josse, Moulines and Sardy (2019)
		arXiv:1703.02296v4.
