		Imputation of Count Data using Side Information // Analysis,
		imputation, and multiple imputation of count data using
		covariates. LORI uses a log-linear model where main row and
		column effects are decomposed as regression terms on known
		covariates. A residual low-rank interaction term is also
		fitted. LORI returns estimates of covariate effects and
		interactions, as well as an imputed count table. The package
		also contains a multiple imputation procedure.
