		Simply Beautiful PDF Letters from Markdown // Write beautiful yet
		customizable letters in R Markdown and directly obtain the
		finished PDF. Smooth generation of PDFs is realized by
		'rmarkdown', the 'pandoc-letter' template and the 'KOMA-Script'
		letter class. 'KOMA-Script' provides enhanced replacements for
		the standard 'LaTeX' classes with emphasis on typography and
		versatility. 'KOMA-Script' is particularly useful for
		international writers as it handles various paper formats well,
		provides layouts for many common window envelope types (e.g.
		German, US, French, Japanese) and lets you define your own
		layouts. The package comes with a default letter layout based
		on 'DIN 5008B'.
