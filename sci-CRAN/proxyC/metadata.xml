		Computes Proximity in Large Sparse Matrices // Computes proximity
		between rows or columns of large matrices efficiently in C++.
		Functions are optimised for large sparse matrices using the
		Armadillo and Intel TBB libraries. Among various built-in
		similarity/distance measures, computation of correlation,
		cosine similarity, Dice coefficient and Euclidean distance is
		particularly fast.
