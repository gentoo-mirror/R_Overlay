		Stochastic Simulation for Information Retrieval Evaluation:
		Effectiveness Scores // Provides tools for the stochastic
		simulation of effectiveness scores to mitigate data-related
		limitations of Information Retrieval evaluation research, as
		described in Urbano and Nagler (2018)
		doi:10.1145/3209978.3210043. These tools include: fitting,
		selection and plotting distributions to model system
		effectiveness, transformation towards a prespecified expected
		value, proxy to fitting of copula models based on these
		distributions, and simulation of new evaluation data from these
		distributions and copula models.
