		Finding Recurrent DNA Copy Number Alterations and Differences //
		In tumor tissue, underlying genomic instability can lead to DNA
		copy number alterations, e.g., copy number gains or losses.
		Sporadic copy number alterations occur randomly throughout the
		genome, whereas recurrent alterations are observed in the same
		genomic region across multiple independent samples, perhaps
		because they provide a selective growth advantage. Here we use
		cyclic shift permutations to identify recurrent copy number
		alterations in a single cohort or recurrent copy number
		differences in two cohorts based on a common set of genomic
		markers. Additional functionality is provided to perform
		downstream analyses, including the creation of summary files
		and graphics. DiNAMIC.Duo builds upon the original DiNAMIC
		package of Walter et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq717 and leverages the theory
		developed in Walter et al. (2015) doi:10.1093/biomet/asv046. A
		manuscript based on DiNAMIC.Duo is currently under development.
