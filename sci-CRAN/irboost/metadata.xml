		Iteratively Reweighted Boosting for Robust Analysis // Fit a
		predictive model with the iteratively reweighted boosting
		(IRBoost) that minimizes the robust loss functions in the CC-
		family (concave-convex). The convex optimization is conducted
		by functional descent boosting algorithm in the R package
		xgboost. The IRBoost reduces the weight of the observation that
		leads to a large loss; it also provides weights to help
		identify outliers. Applications include the robust generalized
		linear models and extensions, where the mean is related to the
		predictors by boosting, and robust accelerated failure time
		models. The package supersedes the R package ccboost. Wang
