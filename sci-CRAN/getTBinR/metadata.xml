		Access and Summarise World Health Organization Tuberculosis Data
		// Quickly and easily import analysis ready Tuberculosis (TB)
		burden data, from the World Health Organization (WHO), into R.
		The aim of getTBinR is to allow researchers, and other
		interested individuals, to quickly and easily gain access to a
		detailed TB data set and to start using it to derive key
		insights. It provides a consistent set of tools that can be
		used to rapidly evaluate hypotheses on a widely used data set
		before they are explored further using more complex methods or
		more detailed data. These tools include: generic plotting and
		mapping functions; a data dictionary search tool; an
		interactive shiny dashboard; and an automated, country level,
		TB report. For newer R users, this package reduces the barrier
		to entry by handling data import, munging, and visualisation.
		All plotting and mapping functions are built with ggplot2 so
		can be readily extended.
