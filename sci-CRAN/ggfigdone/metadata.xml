		Manage  Modify 'ggplot' Figures using 'ggfigdone' // When you
		prepare a presentation or a report, you often need to manage a
		large number of 'ggplot' figures. You need to change the figure
		size, modify the title, label, themes, etc. It is inconvenient
		to go back to the original code to make these changes. This
		package provides a simple way to manage 'ggplot' figures. You
		can easily add the figure to the database and update them later
		using CLI (command line interface) or GUI (graphical user
		interface).
