		Call Marker from Snp Data using Binmap // The raw NGS (Next
		Generation Sequencing) variants called from GBS (Genotyping by
		Sequencing) / WES (Whole Exon Sequencing)/ WGS (Whole Genome
		Sequencing) may include many error sites. The 'binmapr' could
		fix the potential error sites and generate highly confident
		markers for downstream analysis, such as QTL (quantitative
		trait locus) mapping, genetic map construction. Davey, J.W.
