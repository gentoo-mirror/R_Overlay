		Convert Regression Between Base Function and 'rms' Package // We
		perform linear, logistic, and cox regression using the base
		functions lm(), glm(), and coxph() in the R software and the
		'survival' package. Likewise, we can use ols(), lrm() and cph()
		from the 'rms' package for the same functionality. Each of
		these two sets of commands has a different focus. In many
		cases, we need to use both sets of commands in the same
		situation, e.g. we need to filter the full subset model using
		AIC, and we need to build a visualization graph for the final
		model. 'base.rms' package can help you to switch between the
		two sets of commands easily.
