		Diversity-Interactions (DI) Models // The 'DImodels' package is
		suitable for analysing data from biodiversity and ecosystem
		function studies using the Diversity-Interactions (DI)
		modelling approach introduced by Kirwan et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1890/08-1684.1. Suitable data will contain proportions
		for each species and a community-level response variable, and
		may also include additional factors, such as blocks or
		treatments. The package can perform data manipulation tasks,
		such as computing pairwise interactions (the DI_data()
		function), can perform an automated model selection process
		(the autoDI() function) and has the flexibility to fit a wide
		range of user-defined DI models (the DI() function).
