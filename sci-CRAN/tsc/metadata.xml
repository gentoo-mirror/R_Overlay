		Likelihood-ratio Tests for Two-Sample Comparisons // Performs the
		two-sample comparisons using the following exact test
		procedures: the exact likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for equality
		of two normal populations proposed in Zhang et al. (2012); the
		combined test based on the LRT and Shapiro-Wilk test for
		normality via the Bonferroni correction technique; the newly
		proposed density-based empirical likelihood (DBEL) ratio test.
		To calculate p-values of the DBEL procedures, three procedures
		are used: (a) the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) method
		implemented in C++, (b) a new interpolation method based on
		regression techniques to operate with tabulated critical values
		of the test statistic; (c) a Bayesian type method that uses the
		tabulated critical values as the prior information and  MC
		generated DBEL-test-statistic's values as data.
