		Fit, Simulate, and Diagnose Hierarchical Exponential-Family
		Models for Big Networks // A toolbox to analyze and simulate
		large networks based on hierarchical exponential-family random
		graph models (HERGMs).'bigergm' implements the estimation for
		large networks efficiently on large networks building on the
		'lighthergm' package. Moreover, the package contains tools for
		simulating networks with local dependence to assess the
		estimates' goodness-of-fit.
