		Fit, Simulate, and Diagnose Hierarchical Exponential-Family
		Models for Big Networks // A toolbox for analyzing and
		simulating large networks based on hierarchical exponential-
		family random graph models (HERGMs).'bigergm' implements the
		estimation for large networks efficiently building on the
		'lighthergm' and 'hergm' packages. Moreover, the package
		contains tools for simulating networks with local dependence to
		assess the goodness-of-fit.
