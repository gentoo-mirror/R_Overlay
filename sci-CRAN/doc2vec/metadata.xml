		Distributed Representations of Sentences, Documents and Topics //
		Learn vector representations of sentences, paragraphs or
		documents by using the 'Paragraph Vector' algorithms, namely
		the distributed bag of words ('PV-DBOW') and the distributed
		memory ('PV-DM') model. The techniques in the package are
		detailed in the paper "Distributed Representations of Sentences
		and Documents" by Mikolov et al. (2014), available at
		arXiv:1405.4053. The package also provides an implementation to
		cluster documents based on these embedding using a technique
		called top2vec. Top2vec finds clusters in text documents by
		combining techniques to embed documents and words and density-
		based clustering. It does this by embedding documents in the
		semantic space as defined by the 'doc2vec' algorithm. Next it
		maps these document embeddings to a lower-dimensional space
		using the 'Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection'
		(UMAP) clustering algorithm and finds dense areas in that space
		using a 'Hierarchical Density-Based Clustering' technique
		(HDBSCAN). These dense areas are the topic clusters which can
		be represented by the corresponding topic vector which is an
		aggregate of the document embeddings of the documents which are
		part of that topic cluster. In the same semantic space similar
		words can be found which are representative of the topic. More
		details can be found in the paper 'Top2Vec: Distributed
		Representations of Topics' by D. Angelov available at
		arXiv:2008.09470.
