		A Collection of Fluorescence Fluctuation Spectroscopy Methods //
		A set of tools for fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy data
		analysis performance is provided in this package. It includes
		techniques such as single-point fluorescence correlation
		spectroscopy, autocorrelation and pair correlation functions,
		number  brightness (raster line scan) and a novel, recently
		developed method by Hinde and co-workers, pair correlation of
		molecular brightness (doi:10.1038/ncomms11047). A set of
		simulations and real experimental data is used for the examples
		of each function provided in this package. For an in-depth
		description of the basics behind each function here included
		and a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use them on your
		own data, please refer to the Supplementary Material file
		provided at (https://github.com/RPintoC/FCSlib_Sup_Data).
