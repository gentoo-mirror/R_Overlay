		A Collection of Fluorescence Fluctuation Spectroscopy Methods //
		A set of tools for fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy data
		analysis performance is provided in this package. It includes
		techniques such as single-point fluorescence correlation
		spectroscopy, autocorrelation and pair correlation functions,
		number  brightness (raster line scan) and a novel method
		recently developed by Hinde and co-workers, pair correlation of
		molecular brightness. A set of simulations and real
		experimental data is used for the examples of each function
		provided in this package. For an in-depth description of the
		basics behind each function here included and a detailed step-
		by-step guide on how to use them on your own data, please refer
		to the Supplementary Material file provided at
		(https://github.com/RPintoC/FCSlib_Sup). R.A. Migueles-Ramirez,
