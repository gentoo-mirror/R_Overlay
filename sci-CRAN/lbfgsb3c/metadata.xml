		Limited Memory BFGS Minimizer with Bounds on Parameters with
		optim() 'C' Interface // Interfacing to Nocedal et al.
		L-BFGS-B.3.0 (See
		http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html)
		limited memory BFGS minimizer with bounds on parameters. This
		is a fork of 'lbfgsb3'. This registers a 'R' compatible 'C'
		interface to L-BFGS-B.3.0 that uses the same function types and
		optimization as the optim() function (see writing 'R'
		extensions and source for details).  This package also adds
		more stopping criteria as well as allowing the adjustment of
		more tolerances.
