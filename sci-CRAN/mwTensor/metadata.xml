		Multi-Way Component Analysis // For single tensor data, any
		matrix factorization method can be specified the matricised
		tensor in each dimension by Multi-way Component Analysis
		(MWCA). An originally extended MWCA is also implemented to
		specify and decompose multiple matrices and tensors
		simultaneously (CoupledMWCA). See the reference section of
		GitHub README.md https://github.com/rikenbit/mwTensor, for
		details of the methods.
