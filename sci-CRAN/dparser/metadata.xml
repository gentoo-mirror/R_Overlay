		Port of 'Dparser' Package // A Scannerless GLR parser/parser
		generator.  Note that GLR standing for "generalized LR", where
		L stands for "left-to-right" and R stands for "rightmost
		(derivation)".  For more information see
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLR_parser. This parser is based
		on the Tomita (1987) algorithm. (Paper can be found at
		https://aclanthology.org/P84-1073.pdf). The original 'dparser'
		package documentation can be found at
		https://dparser.sourceforge.net/.  This allows you to add mini-
		languages to R (like RxODE's ODE mini-language Wang, Hallow,
		and James 2015 DOI:10.1002/psp4.12052) or to parse other
		languages like 'NONMEM' to automatically translate them to R
		code.   To use this in your code, add a LinkingTo dparser in
		your DESCRIPTION file and instead of using #include dparse.h
		use #include dparser.h.  This also provides a R-based port of
		the make_dparser
		https://dparser.sourceforge.net/d/make_dparser.cat command
		called mkdparser().  Additionally you can parse an arbitrary
		grammar within R using the dparse() function, which works on
		most OSes and is mainly for grammar testing.  The fastest
		parsing, of course, occurs at the C level, and is suggested.
