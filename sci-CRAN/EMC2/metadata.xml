		Bayesian Hierarchical Analysis of Cognitive Models of Choice //
		Fit Bayesian (hierarchical) cognitive models using a linear
		modeling language interface using particle metropolis Markov
		chain Monte Carlo sampling with Gibbs steps. The diffusion
		decision model (DDM), linear ballistic accumulator model (LBA),
		racing diffusion model (RDM), and the lognormal race model
		(LNR) are supported. Additionally, users can specify their own
		likelihood function and/or choose for non-hierarchical
		estimation, as well as for a diagonal, blocked or full
		multivariate normal group-level distribution to test individual
		differences. Prior specification is facilitated through methods
		that visualize the (implied) prior. A wide range of plotting
		functions assist in assessing model convergence and posterior
		inference. Models can be easily evaluated using functions that
		plot posterior predictions or using relative model comparison
		metrics such as information criteria or Bayes factors.
