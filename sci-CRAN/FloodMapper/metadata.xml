		Cross-Scale Flooding Prediction under Heavy Precipitation // A
		gridded model to facilitate cross-scale flooding prediction
		under heavy precipitation events. The model also allows the
		consideration of current urban stormwater systems and their
		future developments in order to help explore potential
		adaptation strategies against climate change. Reference: Wang,
		X., G. Huang, and J. Liu (2014) doi:10.1002/2014JD022564.
