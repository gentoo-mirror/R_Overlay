		Interface Tools for LSD Simulation Results Files // Interfaces R
		with LSD simulation models. Reads object-oriented data in
		results files (.res[.gz]) produced by LSD and creates
		appropriate multi-dimensional arrays in R. Supports multiple
		core parallel threads of multi-file data reading for increased
		performance. Also provides functions to extract basic
		information and statistics from data files. LSD (Laboratory for
		Simulation Development) is free software developed by Marco
		Valente (documentation and downloads available at
		https://www.labsimdev.org/).
