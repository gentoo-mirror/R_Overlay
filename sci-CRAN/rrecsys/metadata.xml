		Environment for Evaluating Recommender Systems // Processes
		standard recommendation datasets (e.g., a user-item rating
		matrix) as input and generates rating predictions and lists of
		recommended items. Standard algorithm implementations which are
		included in this package are the following: Global/Item/User-
		Average baselines, Weighted Slope One, Item-Based KNN, User-
		Based KNN, FunkSVD, BPR and weighted ALS. They can be assessed
		according to the standard offline evaluation methodology
		(Shani, et al. (2011) doi:10.1007/978-0-387-85820-3_8) for
		recommender systems using measures such as MAE, RMSE,
		Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, NDCG, RankScore and coverage
		measures. The package (Coba, et al.(2017) doi:
		10.1007/978-3-319-60042-0_36) is intended for rapid prototyping
		of recommendation algorithms and education purposes.
