		Association Rule Classification // Implements the Classification-
		based on Association Rules (CBA) (Bing Liu, Wynne Hsu, Yiming
		Ma (1999) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3000292.3000305)
		algorithm for association rule classification (ARC). The
		package also contains several convenience methods that allow to
		automatically set CBA parameters (minimum confidence, minimum
		support) and it also natively handles numeric attributes by
		integrating a pre-discretization step. The rule generation
		phase is handled by the 'arules' package. To further decrease
		the size of the CBA models produced by the 'arc' package,
		postprocessing by the 'qCBA' package is suggested. QCBA package
		can be obtained from CRAN archive or from
		https://github.com/kliegr/QCBA.
