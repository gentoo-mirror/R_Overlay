		Visualize Multi-Component Interventions in Network Meta-Analysis
		// A set of functions providing several visualization tools for
		exploring the behavior of the components in a network meta-
		analysis of multi-component (complex) interventions: -
		components descriptive analysis - heat plot of the two-by-two
		component combinations - leaving one component combination out
		scatter plot - violin plot for specific component combinations'
		effects - density plot for components' effects - waterfall plot
		for the interventions' effects that differ by a certain
		component combination - network graph of components - rank heat
		plot of components for multiple outcomes. The implemented tools
		are described by Seitidis et al. (2023) doi:10.1002/jrsm.1617.
