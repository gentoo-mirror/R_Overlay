		Heuristics Including Take the Best and Unit-Weight Linear //
		Implements various heuristics like Take The Best and unit-
		weight linear, which do two-alternative choice: which of two
		objects will have a higher criterion?  Also offers functions to
		assess performance, e.g. percent correct across all row pairs
		in a data set and finding row pairs where models disagree. New
		models can be added by implementing a fit and predict
		function-- see vignette.  Take The Best was first described in:
		Gigerenzer, G.  Goldstein, D. G. (1996)
		doi:10.1037/0033-295X.103.4.650.  All of these heuristics were
		run on many data sets and analyzed in: Gigerenzer, G., Todd, P.
		M.,  the ABC Group (1999). ISBN:978-0195143812.
