		Multivariate Synthetic Control Method Using Time Series // Three
		generalizations of the synthetic control method (which has
		already an implementation in package 'Synth') are implemented:
		first, 'MSCMT' allows for using multiple outcome variables,
		second, time series can be supplied as economic predictors, and
		third, a well-defined cross-validation approach can be used.
		Much effort has been taken to make the implementation as stable
		as possible (including edge cases) without losing computational
		efficiency. A detailed description of the main algorithms is
		given in Becker and Klner (2018)
