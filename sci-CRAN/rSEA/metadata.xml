		Simultaneous Enrichment Analysis // SEA performs simultaneous
		feature-set testing for (gen)omics data. It tests the unified
		null hypothesis controls the family-wise error rate for all
		possible pathways. The unified null hypothesis is defined as:
		"The proportion of true features in the set is less than or
		equal to the threshold c", where c is selected by the user.
		Family-wise error rate control is provided through use of
		closed testing with Simes test. For more information on closed
		testing with Simes see Goeman et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asz041 and for more information about the
		properties and performance of SEA procedure see Ebrahimpoor et
		al. (2019) doi:10.1093/bib/bbz074.
