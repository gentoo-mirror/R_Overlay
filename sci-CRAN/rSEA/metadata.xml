		Simultaneous Enrichment Analysis // SEA performs simultaneous
		feature-set testing for (gen)omics data. It tests the unified
		null hypothesis and controls the family-wise error rate for all
		possible pathways. The unified null hypothesis is defined as:
		"The proportion of true features in the set is less than or
		equal to a threshold." Family-wise error rate control is
		provided through use of closed testing with Simes test. There
		are some practical functions to play around with the pathways
		of interest.
