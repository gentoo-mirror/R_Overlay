		Useful Functions for Ridit Analysis // Functions to compute ridit
		scores of vectors, compute mean ridits and their standard
		errors for vectors compared to a reference vector, as described
		in Fleiss (1981, ISBN:0-471-06428-9), and compute means/SEs for
		multiple groups in matrices. Data can be either counts or
		proportions. Emphasis is on ridit analysis of ordered
		categorical data such as Likert items and pain-rating scales.
