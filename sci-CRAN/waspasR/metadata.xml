		doi:10.5755/j01.eee.122.6.1810. So this package offers
		functions that analyze and validate the raw data, which must be
		entered in a determined format; extract specific vectors and
		matrices from this raw database; normalize the input data;
		calculate rankings by intermediate methods; apply the lambda
		parameter for the main method; and a function that does
		everything at once. The package has an example database called
		choppers, with which the user can see how the input data should
		be organized so that everything works as recommended by the
		decision methods based on multiple criteria that this package
		solves. Basically, the data are composed of a set of
		alternatives, which will be ranked, a set of choice criteria, a
		matrix of values for each Alternative-Criterion relationship, a
		vector of weights associated with the criteria, since certain
		criteria are considered more important than others, as well as
		a vector that defines each criterion as cost or benefit, this
		determines the calculation formula, as there are those criteria
		that we want the highest possible value (e.g. durability) and
		others that we want the lowest possible value (e.g. price).
