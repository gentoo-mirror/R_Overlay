		Expected Shortfall Backtesting // Implementations of the expected
		shortfall backtests of Bayer and Dimitriadis (2020)
		doi:10.1093/jjfinec/nbaa013 as well as other well known
		backtests from the literature. Can be used to assess the
		correctness of forecasts of the expected shortfall risk measure
		which is e.g. used in the banking and finance industry for
		quantifying the market risk of investments. A special feature
		of the backtests of  Bayer and Dimitriadis (2020)
		doi:10.1093/jjfinec/nbaa013 is that they only require forecasts
		of  the expected shortfall, which is in striking contrast to
		all other existing backtests, making them particularly
		attractive for practitioners.
