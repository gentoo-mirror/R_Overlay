		Fast Multivariate Analyses of Big Genomic Data // Fast
		computation of multivariate analyses of small (10s to 100s
		markers) to big (1000s to 100000s) genotype data. Runs
		Principal Component Analysis allowing for centering, z-score
		standardization and scaling for genetic drift, projection of
		ancient samples to modern genetic space and multivariate tests
		for differences in group location (Permutation-Based
		Multivariate Analysis of Variance) and dispersion (Permutation-
		Based Multivariate Analysis of Dispersion).
