		Create and Append a Data Dictionary for an R Dataset // Designed
		to create a basic data dictionary and append to the original
		dataset's attributes list. The package makes use of a tidy
		dataset and creates a data frame that will serve as a linker
		that will aid in building the dictionary. The dictionary is
		then appended to the list of the original dataset's attributes.
		The user will have the option of entering variable and item
		descriptions by writing code or use alternate functions that
		will prompt the user to add these.
