		Breaks Single Page Applications from 'flexdashboard' in Multiple
		Files // A drop-in replacement for 'flexdashboard' 'Rmd'
		documents, which implements an after-knit-hook to split the
		generated single page application in one document per main
		section to reduce rendering load in the web browser displaying
		the document. Put all 'JavaScript' stuff needed in all sections
		before the first headline featuring navigation menu attributes.
		This package is experimental and maybe replaced by a solution
		inside 'flexdashboard'.
