		Impute and Analyze Data with BLOQ Observations // It includes
		estimating the area under the concentrations versus time curve
		(AUC) and its standard error for data with Below the Limit of
		Quantification (BLOQ) observations. Two approaches are
		implemented: direct estimation using censored maximum
		likelihood, also by first imputing the BLOQ's using various
		methods, then compute AUC and its standard error using imputed
		data. Technical details can found in Barnett, Helen Yvette,
		Helena Geys, Tom Jacobs, and Thomas Jaki. "Methods for Non-
		Compartmental Pharmacokinetic Analysis With Observations Below
		the Limit of Quantification." Statistics in Biopharmaceutical
		Research (2020): 1-12. (available online: https://www.tandfonli
