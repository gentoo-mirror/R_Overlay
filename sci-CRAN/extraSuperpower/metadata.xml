		Power Calculation for Two-Way Factorial Designs // The basic use
		of this package is with 3 sequential functions. One to generate
		expected cell means and standard deviations, along with
		correlation and covariance matrices in the case of repeated
		measurements. This is followed by experiment simulation i
		number of times. Finally, power is calculated from the
		simulated data. Features that may be considered in the model
		are interaction, measure correlation and non-normal
		distributions.
