		Penalized High-Dimensional Joint Model // Joint models have been
		widely used to study the associations between longitudinal
		biomarkers and a survival outcome. However, existing joint
		models only consider one or a few longitudinal biomarkers and
		cannot deal with high-dimensional longitudinal biomarkers. This
		package can be used to fit our recently developed penalized
		joint model that can handle high-dimensional longitudinal
		biomarkers. Specifically, an adaptive lasso penalty is imposed
		on the parameters for the effects of the longitudinal
		biomarkers on the survival outcome, which allows for variable
		selection. Also, our algorithm is computationally efficient,
		which is based on the Gaussian variational approximation
		method.
