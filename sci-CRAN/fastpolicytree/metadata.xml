		Constructs Policy Trees from Covariate and Reward Data //
		Constructs optimal policy trees which provide a rule-based
		treatment prescription policy. Input is covariate and reward
		data, where, typically, the rewards will be doubly robust
		reward estimates. This package aims to construct optimal policy
		trees more quickly than the existing 'policytree' package and
		is intended to be used alongside that package. For more details
		see Cussens, Hatamyar, Shah and Kreif (2025)
