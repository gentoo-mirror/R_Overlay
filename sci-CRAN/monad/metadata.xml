		Operators and Generics for Monads // Compose generic monadic
		function pipelines with %% and %-% based on implementing the
		'S7' generics fmap() and bind(). Methods are provided for the
		built-in list type and the maybe class from the 'maybe'
		package. The concepts are modelled directly after the Monad
		typeclass in Haskell, but adapted for idiomatic use in R.
