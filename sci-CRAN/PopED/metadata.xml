		Population (and Individual) Optimal Experimental Design //
		Optimal experimental designs for both population and individual
		studies based on nonlinear mixed-effect models. Often this is
		based on a computation of the Fisher Information Matrix. This
		package was developed for pharmacometric problems, and examples
		and predefined models are available for these types of systems.
		The methods are described in Nyberg et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.05.005, and Foracchia et al. (2004)
		doi:10.1016/S0169-2607(03)00073-7.
