		Sequential Optimal Designs for Two-Colour cDNA Microarray
		Experiments // Computes sequential A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or
		near-optimal block and row-column designs for two-colour cDNA
		microarray experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed
		effects models where the interest is in a comparison of all
		possible elementary treatment contrasts. The package also
		provides an optional method of using the graphical user
		interface (GUI) R package 'tcltk' to ensure that it is user
		friendly.
