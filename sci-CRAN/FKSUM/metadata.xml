		Fast Kernel Sums // Implements the method of Hofmeyr, D.P. (2019)
		10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2930501 for fast evaluation of univariate
		kernel smoothers based on recursive computations. Applications
		to the basic problems of density and regression function
		estimation are provided, as well as some projection pursuit
		methods for which the objective is based on non-parametric
		functionals of the projected density, or conditional density of
		a response given projected covariates.
