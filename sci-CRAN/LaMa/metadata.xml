		Fast Numerical Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Latent Markov
		Models // The class of latent Markov models, including hidden
		Markov models, hidden semi-Markov models, state space models,
		and point processes, is a very popular and powerful framework
		for inference of time series driven by latent processes.
		Furthermore, all these models can be fitted using direct
		numerical maximum likelihood estimation using the so-called
		forward algorithm as discussed in Zucchini et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1201/b20790. However, due to their great flexibility,
		researchers using these models in applied work often need to
		build highly customized models for which standard software
		implementation is lacking, or the construction of such models
		in said software is as complicated as writing fully tailored
		'R' code. While providing greater flexibility and control, the
		latter suffers from slow estimation speeds that make custom
		solutions inconvenient. We address the above issues in two
		ways. First, standard blocks of code, common to all these model
		classes, are implemented as simple-to-use functions that can be
		added like Lego blocks to an otherwise fully custom likelihood
		function, making writing custom code much easier. Second, under
		the hood, these functions are written in 'C++', allowing for
		10-20 times faster evaluation time, and thus drastically
		speeding up model estimation. To aid in building fully custom
		likelihood functions, several vignettes are included that show
		how to simulate data from and estimate all the above model
		classes.
