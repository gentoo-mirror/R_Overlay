		Fast Numerical Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Latent Markov
		Models // A variety of latent Markov models, including hidden
		Markov models, hidden semi-Markov models, state-space models
		and continuous-time variants can be formulated and estimated
		within the same framework via directly maximising the
		likelihood function using the so-called forward algorithm.
		Applied researchers often need custom models that standard
		software does not easily support. Writing tailored 'R' code
		offers flexibility but suffers from slow estimation speeds. We
		address these issues by providing easy-to-use functions
		(written in 'C++' for speed) for common tasks like the forward
		algorithm. These functions can be combined into custom models
		in a Lego-type approach, offering up to 10-20 times faster
		estimation via standard numerical optimisers. To aid in
		building fully custom likelihood functions, several vignettes
		are included that show how to simulate data from and estimate
		all the above model classes.
