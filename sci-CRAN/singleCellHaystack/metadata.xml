		Finding Needles (=differentially Expressed Genes) in Haystacks
		(=single Cell Data) // Identification of differentially
		expressed genes (DEGs) is a key step in single-cell
		transcriptomics data analysis. 'singleCellHaystack' predicts
		DEGs without relying on clustering of cells into arbitrary
		clusters. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is often
		processed to fewer dimensions using Principal Component
		Analysis (PCA) and represented in 2-dimensional plots (e.g.
		t-SNE or UMAP plots). 'singleCellHaystack' uses Kullback-
		Leibler divergence to find genes that are expressed in subsets
		of cells that are non-randomly positioned in a these multi-
		dimensional spaces or 2D representations. For the theoretical
		background of 'singleCellHaystack' we refer to Vandenbon and
		Diez (2019) doi:10.1101/557967.
