		Measuring Cell Type Similarity with Gene Ontology in Single-Cell
		RNA-Seq // Traditional methods for analyzing single cell RNA-
		seq datasets focus solely on gene expression, but this package
		introduces a novel approach that goes beyond this limitation.
		Using Gene Ontology terms as features, the package allows for
		the functional profile of cell populations, and comparison
		within and between datasets from the same or different species.
		Our approach enables the discovery of previously unrecognized
		functional similarities and differences between cell types and
		has demonstrated success in identifying cell types' functional
		correspondence even between evolutionarily distant species.
