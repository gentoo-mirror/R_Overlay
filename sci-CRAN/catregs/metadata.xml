		Post-Estimation Functions for Generalized Linear Mixed Models //
		Several functions for working with mixed effects regression
		models for limited dependent variables. The functions
		facilitate post-estimation of model predictions or margins, and
		comparisons between model predictions for assessing or probing
		moderation. Additional helper functions facilitate model
		comparisons and implements simulation-based inference for model
		predictions of alternative-specific outcome models. See also,
		Melamed and Doan (2024, ISBN: 978-1032509518).
