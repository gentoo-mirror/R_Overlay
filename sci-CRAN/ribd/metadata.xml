		Pedigree-based Relatedness Coefficients // Recursive algorithms
		for computing various relatedness coefficients, including
		pairwise kinship, kappa and identity coefficients. Both
		autosomal and X-linked coefficients are computed. Founders are
		allowed to be inbred, enabling construction of any given kappa
		coefficients (Vigeland (2020) doi:10.1007/s00285-020-01505-x).
		In addition to the standard pairwise coefficients, 'ribd' also
		computes a range of lesser-known coefficients, including
		generalised kinship coefficients (Karigl (1981)
		doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1981.tb00341.x; Weeks and Lange (1988)
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1715269), two-
		locus coefficients (Thompson (1988) doi:10.1093/imammb/5.4.261)
		and multi-person coefficients. This package is part of the 'ped
		suite', a collection of packages for pedigree analysis in R.
		Several methods of 'ribd' are featured in the online app
		'QuickPed' available at https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped.
