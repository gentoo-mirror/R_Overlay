		NeuroAnatomy Toolbox for Analysis of 3D Image Data //
		NeuroAnatomy Toolbox (nat) enables analysis and visualisation
		of 3D biological image data, especially traced neurons. Reads
		and writes 3D images in NRRD and 'Amira' AmiraMesh formats and
		reads surfaces in 'Amira' hxsurf format. Traced neurons can be
		imported from and written to SWC and 'Amira' LineSet and
		SkeletonGraph formats. These data can then be visualised in 3D
		via 'rgl', manipulated including applying calculated
		registrations, e.g. using the 'CMTK' registration suite, and
		analysed. There is also a simple representation for neurons
		that have been subjected to 3D skeletonisation but not formally
		traced; this allows morphological comparison between neurons
		including searches and clustering (via the 'nat.nblast'
		extension package).
