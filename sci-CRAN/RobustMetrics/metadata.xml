		Calculates Robust Performance Metrics for Imbalanced
		Classification Problems // Calculates robust Matthews
		Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and robust F-Beta Scores, as
		introduced by Holzmann and Klar (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.07661. These performance metrics are
		designed for imbalanced classification problems. Plots the
		receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) together
		with the recall / 1-precision curve.
