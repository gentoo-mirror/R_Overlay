		The 'WORDLE' Game // The 'Wordle' game. Players have six attempts
		to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the player is
		informed which letters in their guess are either: anywhere in
		the word; in the right position in the word. This can be used
		to inform the next guess. Can be played interactively in the
		console, or programmatically. Based on Josh Wardle's game
		https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/.
