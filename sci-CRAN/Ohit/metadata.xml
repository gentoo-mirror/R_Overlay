		OGA+HDIC+Trim and High-Dimensional Linear Regression Models //
		Ing and Lai (2011) doi:10.5705/ss.2010.081 proposed a high-
		dimensional model selection procedure that comprises three
		steps: orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA), high-dimensional
		information criterion (HDIC), and Trim. The first two steps,
		OGA and HDIC, are used to sequentially select input variables
		and determine stopping rules, respectively. The third step,
		Trim, is used to delete irrelevant variables remaining in the
		second step. This package aims at fitting a high-dimensional
		linear regression model via OGA+HDIC+Trim.
