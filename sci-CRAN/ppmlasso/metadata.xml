		Point Process Models with LASSO Penalties // Toolkit for fitting
		point process models with sequences of LASSO penalties
		("regularisation paths"). Regularisation paths of Poisson point
		process models or area-interaction models can be fitted with
		LASSO, adaptive LASSO or elastic net penalties. A number of
		criteria are available to judge the bias-variance tradeoff.
