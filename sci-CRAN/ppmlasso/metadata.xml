		Point Process Models with LASSO-Type Penalties // Toolkit for
		fitting point process models with sequences of LASSO penalties
		("regularisation paths"), as described in Renner, I.W. and
		Warton, D.I. (2013) doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2012.01824.x.
		Regularisation paths of Poisson point process models or area-
		interaction models can be fitted with LASSO, adaptive LASSO or
		elastic net penalties. A number of criteria are available to
		judge the bias-variance tradeoff.
