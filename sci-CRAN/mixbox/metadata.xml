		Observed Fisher Information Matrix for Finite Mixture Model //
		Developed for the following tasks. 1- simulating realizations
		from the canonical, restricted, and unrestricted finite mixture
		models. 2- Monte Carlo approximation for density function of
		the finite mixture models. 3- Monte Carlo approximation for the
		observed Fisher information matrix, asymptotic standard error,
		and the corresponding confidence intervals for parameters of
		the mixture models sing the method proposed by Basford et al.
