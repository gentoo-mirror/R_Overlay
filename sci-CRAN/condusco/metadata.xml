		Query-Driven Pipeline Execution and Query Templates // Runs a
		function iteratively over each row of either a dataframe or the
		results of a query.  Use the 'BigQuery' and 'DBI' wrappers to
		iteratively pass each row of query results to a function.  If a
		field contains a 'JSON' string, it will be converted to an
		object.  This is helpful for queries that return 'JSON' strings
		that represent objects. These fields can then be treated as
		objects by the pipeline.
