		Networks Characterising the Physical Configurations of Animal
		Habitats // Functions for generating and visualising networks
		for characterising the physical attributes and spatial
		organisations of habitat components (i.e. habitat physical
		configurations). The network generating algorithm first
		determines the X and Y coordinates of N nodes within a
		rectangle with a side length of L and an area of A. Then it
		computes the pair-wise Euclidean distance Dij between node i
		and j, and then a complete network with 1/Dij as link weights
		is constructed. Then, the algorithm removes links from the
		complete network with the probability as shown in the function
		ahn_prob(). Such link removals can make the network
		disconnected whereas a connected network is wanted. In such
		cases, the algorithm rewires one network component to its
		spatially nearest neighbouring component and repeat doing this
		until the network is connected again. Finally, it outputs an
		undirected network (weighted or unweighted, connected or
		disconnected). This package came with a manuscript on modelling
		the physical configurations of animal habitats using networks
		(in preparation).
