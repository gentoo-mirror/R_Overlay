		Partitioned Local Depths for Community Structure in Data //
		Implementation of the Partitioned Local Depths (PaLD) approach
		which provides a measure of local depth and the cohesion of a
		point to another which  (together with a universal threshold
		for distinguishing strong and weak ties) may be used to reveal
		local and global structure in data, based on methods described
		in Berenhaut, Moore, and Melvin (2022)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.2003634119. No extraneous inputs,
		distributional assumptions, iterative procedures nor
		optimization criteria are employed. This package includes
		functions for computing local depths and cohesion as well as
		flexible functions for plotting community networks and displays
		of cohesion against distance.
