		Process and Report 'GreenFeed' Data // Downloading, Processing,
		and Reporting 'GreenFeed' Data. The 'GreenFeed' system
		generates substantial amounts of daily data, which can be
		overwhelming for users. This package facilitates data retrieval
		and reporting from the 'GreenFeed' system using a streamlined
		process. Users can retrieve data from the 'C-Lock Inc.' system
		via an 'API' using the get_gfdata() function. Additionally, the
		report_gfdata() function allows users to generate both daily
		and final reports from 'GreenFeed' data. The process_gfdata()
		function further processes this data for analysis. For pellet
		intake processing and visit checks, the package also provides
		the pellin() and viseat() functions, ensuring a comprehensive
		toolset for managing and analyzing 'GreenFeed' data.
