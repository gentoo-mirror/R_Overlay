		Finding the Best Model Using Eight Metrics Values // In
		statistical modeling, multiple models need to be compared based
		on certain criteria. The method described here uses eight
		metrics from 'AllMetrics' package. input_df is the data frame
		(at least two columns for comparison) containing metrics values
		in different rows of a column (which denotes a particular
		models performance). First five metrics are expected to be
		minimum and last three metrics are expected to be maximum for a
		model to be considered good. Firstly, every metric value (among
		first five) is searched in every columns and minimum values are
		denoted as MIN and other values are denoted as NA. Secondly,
		every metric (among last three) is searched in every columns
		and maximum values are denoted as MAX and other values are
		denoted as NA. output_df contains the similar number of rows
		(which is 8) and columns (which is number of models to be
		compared) as of input_df. Values in output_df are corresponding
		NA, MIN or MAX. Finally, the column containing minimum number
		of NA values is denoted as the best column. min_NA_col gives
		the name of the best column (model). min_NA_values are the
		corresponding metrics values. BestColumn_metrics is the data
		frame (dimension: 1*8) containing different metrics of the best
		column (model). best_column_results is the final result (a
		list) containing all of these output elements. In special case,
		if two columns having equal 'NA', it will be checked among
		these two column which one is having least 'NA' in first five
		rows and will be inferred as the best. More details about
		'AllMetrics' can be found in Garai (2023)
