		Stratigraphic Paleobiology Modeling Pipelines // The fossil
		record is a joint expression of ecological, taphonomic,
		evolutionary, and stratigraphic processes (Holland and
		Patzkowsky, 2012, ISBN:978-0226649382). This package allowing
		to simulate biological processes in the time domain (e.g.,
		trait evolution, fossil abundance), and examine how their
		expression in the rock record (stratigraphic domain) is
		influenced based on age-depth models, ecological niche models,
		and taphonomic effects. Functions simulating common processes
		used in modeling trait evolution or event type data such as
		first/last occurrences are provided and can be used standalone
		or as part of a pipeline. The package comes with example data
		sets and tutorials in several vignettes, which can be used as a
		template to set up one's own simulation.
