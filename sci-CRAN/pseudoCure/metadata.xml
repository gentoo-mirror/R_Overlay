		A Pseudo-Observations Approach for Analyzing Survival Data with a
		Cure Fraction // A collection of easy-to-use tools for
		regression analysis of survival data with a cure fraction
		proposed in Su et al. (2022) doi:10.1177/09622802221108579. The
		modeling framework is based on the Cox proportional hazards
		mixture cure model and the bounded cumulative hazard (promotion
		time cure) model. The pseudo-observations approach is utilized
		to assess covariate effects and embedded in the variable
		selection procedure.
