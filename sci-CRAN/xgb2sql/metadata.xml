		Convert Trained 'XGBoost' Model to SQL Query // This tool enables
		in-database scoring of 'XGBoost' models built in R, by
		translating trained model objects into SQL query. 'XGBoost'
		https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html provides
		parallel tree boosting (also known as gradient boosting
		machine, or GBM) algorithms in a highly efficient, flexible and
		portable way. GBM algorithm is introduced by Friedman (2001)
		doi:10.1214/aos/1013203451, and more details on 'XGBoost' can
		be found in Chen  Guestrin (2016) doi:10.1145/2939672.2939785.
