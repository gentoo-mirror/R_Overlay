		Programming with Big Data -- Interface to ZeroMQ // 'ZeroMQ' is a
		well-known library for high-performance asynchronous messaging
		in scalable, distributed applications.  This package provides
		high level R wrapper functions to easily utilize 'ZeroMQ'. We
		mainly focus on interactive client/server programming
		frameworks. For convenience, a minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.1.0
		rc1) is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used if no system
		installation of 'ZeroMQ' is available.  A few wrapper functions
		compatible with 'rzmq' are also provided.
