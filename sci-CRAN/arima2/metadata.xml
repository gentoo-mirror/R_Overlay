		Likelihood Based Inference for ARIMA Modeling // Estimating and
		analyzing auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
		models. The primary function in this package is arima(), which
		fits an ARIMA model to univariate time series data using a
		random restart algorithm. This approach frequently leads to
		models that have model likelihood greater than or equal to that
		of the likelihood obtained by fitting the same model using the
		arima() function from the 'stats' package. This package enables
		proper optimization of model likelihoods, which is a necessary
		condition for performing likelihood ratio tests. This package
		relies heavily on the source code of the arima() function of
		the 'stats' package. For more information, please see Jesse
		Wheeler and Edward L. Ionides (2023)
