		Interactive Scatter Plot and Volcano Plot Labels // Interactive
		labelling of scatter plots, volcano plots and Manhattan plots
		using a 'shiny' and 'plotly' interface. Users can hover over
		points to see where specific points are located and click
		points on/off to easily label them. Labels can be dragged
		around the plot to place them optimally. Plots can be exported
		directly to PDF for publication. For plots with large numbers
		of points, points can optionally be rasterized as a bitmap,
		while all other elements (axes, text, labels  lines) are
		preserved as vector objects. This can dramatically reduce file
		size for plots with millions of points such as Manhattan plots,
		and is ideal for publication.
