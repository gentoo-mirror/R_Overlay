		Regularized PQL for Joint Selection in GLMMs // Performs joint
		selection in Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) using
		penalized likelihood methods. Specifically, the Penalized
		Quasi-Likelihood (PQL) is used as a loss function, and
		penalties are then "added on" to perform simultaneous fixed and
		random effects selection. Regularized PQL avoids the need for
		integration (or approximations such as the Laplace's method)
		during the estimation process, and so the full solution path
		for model selection can be constructed relatively quickly.
