		Effect Estimates from All Models // Estimates and plots effect
		estimates from models with all possible combinations of a list
		of variables. It can be used for assessing treatment effects in
		clinical trials or risk factors in bio-medical and
		epidemiological research. Like Stata command 'confall' (Wang Z.
		Stata Journal 2007; 7, Number 2, pp. 183196), 'allestimates'
		calculates and stores all effect estimates, and plots them
		against p values or Akaike information criterion (AIC) values.
		It currently has functions for linear regression: all_lm(),
		logistic and Poisson regression: all_glm() and all_speedglm(),
		and Cox proportional hazards regression: all_cox().
