		Effect Estimates from All Models // Estimates and plots effect
		estimates from models with all possible combinations of a list
		of variables. It can be used for assessing treatment effects in
		clinical trials or risk factors in bio-medical and
		epidemiological research. Like Stata command 'confall' (Wang Z
		(2007) doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203 ), 'allestimates'
		calculates and stores all effect estimates, and plots them
		against p values or Akaike information criterion (AIC) values.
		It currently has functions for linear regression: all_lm(),
		logistic and Poisson regression: all_glm(), and Cox
		proportional hazards regression: all_cox().
