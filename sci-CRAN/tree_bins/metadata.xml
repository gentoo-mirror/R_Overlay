		Recategorization of Factor Variables by Decision Tree Leaves //
		Provides users the ability to categorize categorical variables
		dependent on a response variable. It creates a decision tree by
		using one of the categorical variables (class factor) and the
		selected response variable. The decision tree is created from
		the rpart() function from the 'rpart' package. The rules from
		the leaves of the decision tree are extracted, and used to
		recategorize the appropriate categorical variable (predictor).
		This step is performed for each of the categorical variables
		that is fed into the data component of the function. Only
		variables containing more than 2 factor levels will be
		considered in the function. The final output generates a data
		set containing the recategorized variables or a list containing
		a mapping table for each of the candidate variables. For more
		details see T. Hastie et al (2009, ISBN: 978-0-387-84857-0).
