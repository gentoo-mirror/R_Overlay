		Build a Minimalist Gene Ontology (GO) Database (GODB) // Normally
		building a GODB is fairly complicated, involving downloading
		multiple database files and using these to build e.g. a 'mySQL'
		database. Accessing this database is also complicated,
		involving an intimate knowledge of the database in order to
		construct reliable queries. Here we have a more modest goal,
		generating GOGOA3, which is a stripped down version of the GODB
		that was originally restricted to human genes as designated by
		the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) (see
		https://geneontology.org/). I have now added about two dozen
		additional species, namely all species represented on the Gene
		Ontology download page
		https://current.geneontology.org/products/pages/downloads.html.
		This covers most of the model organisms that are commonly used
		in bio-medical and basic research (assuming that anyone still
		has a grant to do such research). This can be built in a matter
		of seconds from 2 easily downloaded files (see
		https://current.geneontology.org/products/pages/downloads.html
		and https://geneontology.org/docs/download-ontology/), and it
		can be queried by e.g. w-which(GOGOA3[,"HGNC"] %in% hgncList)
		where GOGOA3 is a matrix representing the minimalist GODB and
		hgncList is a list of gene identifiers. This database will be
		used in my upcoming package 'GoMiner' which is based on my
		previous publication (see Zeeberg, B.R., Feng, W., Wang, G. et
		al. (2003)doi:10.1186/gb-2003-4-4-r28). Relevant .RData files
		are available from GitHub
		(https://github.com/barryzee/GO/tree/main/databases).
