		Graph Functionality of Free Associated Words // Functions that
		help less experienced R users to make graph analysis for free
		associated words, or more generally for repeated nominal data
		for which a undirected graph analysis is meaningful. By
		corresponding to each word its centrality, it is possible to
		apply standard quantitative analysis methods in order to
		associate word selection with other   variables. The functions
		are implemented with the aid of the 'tibble', 'tidygraph',
		'ggraph' and 'ggplot2' packages. Supported centrality functions
		are centrality_alpha(), centrality_authority(),
		centrality_betweenness(), centrality_closeness(),
		centrality_pagerank(), centrality_eigen(). A data set is
		included.
