		Water Resources System Simulator // Water resources system
		simulator is a tool for simulation and analysis of large-scale
		water resources systems. There are existing packages on CRAN or
		other R repositories for reservoir system simulation and
		optimization (e.g. 'RSSOP' and 'reservoir'). The 'reservoir'
		proposes an implementation of stochastic dynamic programming
		for single reservoir operation, while 'RSSOP' and 'WRSS' are
		just simulator platforms but with capability of large scale
		reservoir operation. Although both 'RSSOP' and 'WRSS' are
		simulators for reservoirs systems, 'WRSS' enables us to
		simulate some more types of hydro-structures (e.g. aquifers,
		diversions, and etc.). Moreover, 'WRSS' is implemented so that
		to detect and simulate complicated water resources layouts
		through codding system and is sophisticated enough to
		understand almost any water resources schemes within the basin
		scale, which is not considered in the previous packages.
