		Enrichment Approach to Predict Which Transcription Factors are
		Regulated // R implementation of 'TFactS' to predict which are
		the transcription factors (TFs), regulated in a biological
		condition based on lists of differentially expressed genes
		(DEGs) obtained from transcriptome experiments. This package is
		based on the 'TFactS' concept by Essaghir et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1093/nar/gkq149 and expands it. It allows users to
		perform 'TFactS'-like enrichment approach. The package can
		import and use the original catalogue file from the 'TFactS' as
		well as users' defined catalogues of interest that are not
		supported by 'TFactS' (e.g., Arabidopsis).
