		Exploratory Chemometrics for 2D Spectroscopy // A collection of
		functions for exploratory chemometrics of 2D spectroscopic data
		sets such as COSY (correlated spectroscopy) and HSQC
		(heteronuclear single quantum coherence) 2D NMR (nuclear
		magnetic resonance) spectra. 'ChemoSpec2D' deploys methods
		aimed primarily at classification of samples and the
		identification of spectral features which are important in
		distinguishing samples from each other. Each 2D spectrum (a
		matrix) is treated as the unit of observation, and thus the
		physical sample in the spectrometer corresponds to the  sample
		from a statistical perspective.  In addition to chemometric
		tools, a few tools are provided for plotting 2D spectra, but
		these are not intended to replace the functionality typically
		available on the spectrometer. 'ChemoSpec2D' takes many of its
		cues from 'ChemoSpec' and tries to create consistent graphical
		output and to be very user friendly.
