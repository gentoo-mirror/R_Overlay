		Density Based Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and
		Related Algorithms // A fast reimplementation of several
		density-based algorithms of the DBSCAN family for spatial data.
		Includes the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of
		applications with noise) and OPTICS (ordering points to
		identify the clustering structure) clustering algorithms
		HDBSCAN (hierarchical DBSCAN) and the LOF (local outlier
		factor) algorithm. The implementations use the kd-tree data
		structure (from library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor
		search. An R interface to fast kNN and fixed-radius NN search
		is also provided. See Hahsler M, Piekenbrock M and Doran D
		(2019) doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i01.
