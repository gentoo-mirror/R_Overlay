		Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
		(DBSCAN) and Related Algorithms // A fast reimplementation of
		several density-based algorithms of the DBSCAN family. Includes
		the clustering algorithms DBSCAN (density-based spatial
		clustering of applications with noise) and HDBSCAN
		(hierarchical DBSCAN), the ordering algorithm OPTICS (ordering
		points to identify the clustering structure), shared nearest
		neighbor clustering, and the outlier detection algorithms LOF
		(local outlier factor) and GLOSH (global-local outlier score
		from hierarchies). The implementations use the kd-tree data
		structure (from library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor
		search. An R interface to fast kNN and fixed-radius NN search
		is also provided. Hahsler, Piekenbrock and Doran (2019)
