		Batch Processing, Modeling and Visualizing the Dose-Response of
		High-Throughput Screening Bioassay // A convenient interface to
		batch process high-throughput toxicology bioassay screening
		data. It's designed specifically for screening experiment that
		features a primary inhibition-type assay and a companion
		cytotoxicity assay. This package provides functions for data
		normalization, quality-control analysis, dose-response curve
		fitting (using the Hill model provided in the 'tcpl' package),
		visualization, and a unique toxicity-adjusted potency ranking
		system.
