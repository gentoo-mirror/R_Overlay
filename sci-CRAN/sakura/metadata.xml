		Extension to R Serialization // Extends the functionality of R
		serialization by augmenting the built-in reference hook system.
		This enhanced implementation allows optimal, one-pass
		integrated serialization that combines R serialization with
		third-party serialization methods. Facilitates the
		serialization of even complex R objects, which contain non-
		system reference objects, such as those accessed via external
		pointers, for use in parallel and distributed computing.
