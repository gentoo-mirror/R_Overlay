		Modeling, Confidence Intervals and Equivalence of Survival Curves
		// We provide a non-parametric and a parametric approach to
		investigate the equivalence (or non-inferiority) of two
		survival curves, obtained from two given datasets. The test is
		based on the creation of confidence intervals at pre-specified
		time points. For the non-parametric approach, the curves are
		given by Kaplan-Meier curves and the variance for calculating
		the confidence intervals is obtained by Greenwood's formula.
		The parametric approach is based on estimating the underlying
		distribution, where the user can choose between a Weibull,
		Exponential, Gaussian, Logistic, Log-normal or a Log-logistic
		distribution. Estimates for the variance for calculating the
		confidence bands are obtained by a (parametric) bootstrap
		approach. For this bootstrap censoring is assumed to be
		exponentially distributed and estimates are obtained from the
		datasets under consideration. All details can be found in
		K.Moellenhoff and A.Tresch: Survival analysis under non-
		proportional hazards: investigating non-inferiority or
		equivalence in time-to-event data arXiv:2009.06699.
