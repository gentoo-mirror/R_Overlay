		Score Test Integrated with Empirical Bayes for Association Study
		// Perform association test within linear mixed model framework
		using score test integrated with Empirical Bayes for genome-
		wide association study. Firstly, score test was conducted for
		each marker under linear mixed model framework, taking into
		account the genetic relatedness and population structure. And
		then all the potentially associated markers were selected with
		a less stringent criterion. Finally, all the selected markers
		were placed into a multi-locus model to identify the true
		quantitative trait nucleotide.
