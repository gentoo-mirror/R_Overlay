		R6-Based Statistical Methods for Quality Science // A
		comprehensive suite of statistical tools for Quality
		Management, designed around the Define, Measure, Analyze,
		Improve, and Control (DMAIC) cycle used in Six Sigma
		methodology. Based on the discontinued CRAN package
		'qualitytools', this package refactors its original design by
		incorporating 'R6' object-oriented programming for increased
		flexibility and performance. It replaces traditional graphics
		with modern, interactive visualizations using 'ggplot2' and
		'plotly'. Built on 'tidyverse' principles, it simplifies data
		manipulation and visualization, offering an intuitive approach
		to quality science.
