		Create Non-Confidential Multi-Resolution Grids // The need for
		anonymization of individual survey responses often leads to
		many suppressed grid cells in a regular grid. Here we provide
		functionality for creating multi-resolution gridded data,
		respecting the confidentiality rules, such as a minimum number
		of units and dominance by one or more units for each  grid
		cell. The functions also include the possibility for contextual
		suppression of data. For more details see Skoien et al. (2025)
