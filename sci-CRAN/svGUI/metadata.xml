		SciViews - Manage GUIs in R // The SciViews svGUI package eases
		the management of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in R. It is
		independent from any particular GUI widgets (Tk, Gtk2, native,
		...). It centralizes info about GUI elements currently used,
		and it dispatches GUI calls to the particular toolkits in use
		in function of the context (is R run at the terminal, within a
		Tk application, a HTML page?).
