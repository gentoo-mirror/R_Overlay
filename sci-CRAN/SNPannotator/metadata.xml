		Investigating the Functional Characteristics of Selected SNPs and
		Their Vicinity Genomic Region // To investigate the functional
		characteristics of selected SNPs and their vicinity genomic
		region. Linked SNPs in moderate to high linkage disequilibrium
		(e.g. r20.50) with the corresponding index SNPs will be
		selected for further analysis.
