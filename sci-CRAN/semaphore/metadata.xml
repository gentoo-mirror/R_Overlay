		Shared Memory Atomic Operations // Implements named semaphores
		from the 'boost' 'C++' library https://www.boost.org/. A
		semaphore object is shared amongst several processes. This
		integer value can be safely incremented or decremented by each
		process. Processes can also wait (blocking) for the value to
		become positive.
