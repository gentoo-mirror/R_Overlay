		Iterated Ordinary Least Squares Regression // Addresses the 'log
		of zero' by developing a new family of estimators called
		iterated Ordinary Least Squares. This family nests standard
		approaches such as log-linear and Poisson regressions, offers
		several computational advantages, and corresponds to the
		correct way to perform the popular log(Y + 1) transformation.
		For more details about how to use it, see the notebook at:
