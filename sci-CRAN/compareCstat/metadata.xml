		Compare C-Statistics (Concordance) Between Survival Models //
		Compare C-statistics (concordance statistics) between two
		survival models, using either bootstrap resampling (Harrell's
		C) or Uno's C with perturbation-resampling (from the survC1
		package). Returns confidence intervals and a p-value for the
		difference in C-statistics. Useful for evaluating and comparing
		predictive performance of survival models. Methods implemented
		for Uno's C are described in Uno et al. (2011)
