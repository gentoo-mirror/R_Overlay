		Exploratory Data Analysis for the 'spatstat' Family //
		Functionality for exploratory data analysis and nonparametric
		analysis of spatial data, mainly spatial point patterns, in the
		'spatstat' family of packages. (Excludes analysis of spatial
		data on a linear network, which is covered by the separate
		package 'spatstat.linnet'.) Methods include quadrat counts,
		K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour
		distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair
		correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk
		estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark
		correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence
		diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal
		hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton,
		two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-
		Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also
		supported.
