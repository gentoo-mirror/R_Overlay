		Simultaneous Multi-Bias Adjustment // Quantify the causal effect
		of a binary exposure on a binary outcome with adjustment for
		multiple biases. The functions can simultaneously adjust for
		any combination of uncontrolled confounding, exposure/outcome
		misclassification, and selection bias. The underlying method
		generalizes the concept of combining inverse probability of
		selection weighting with predictive value weighting.
		Simultaneous multi-bias analysis can be used to enhance the
		validity and transparency of real-world evidence obtained from
		observational, longitudinal studies. Based on the work from
		Paul Brendel, Aracelis Torres, and Onyebuchi Arah (2023)
