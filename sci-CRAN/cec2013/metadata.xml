		Benchmark functions for the Special Session and Competition on
		Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization at CEC-2013 //
		This package provides R wrappers for the C implementation of 28
		benchmark functions defined for the  Special Session and
		Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization at
		CEC-2013. The focus of this package is to provide an open-
		source and multi-platform implementation of the CEC2013
		benchmark functions, in order to make easier for researchers to
		test the performance of new optimization algorithms in a
		reproducible way. The original C code (Windows only) was
		provided by Jane Jing Liang, while GNU/Linux comments were made
		by Janez Brest. This package was gently authorised for
		publication on CRAN by Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan. The
		official documentation is available at http://www.ntu.edu.sg/ho
		me/EPNSugan/index_files/CEC2013/CEC2013.htm. Bugs
		reports/comments/questions are very welcomed (in English,
		Spanish or Italian).
