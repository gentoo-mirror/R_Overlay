		Ordinal Forests: Prediction and Variable Ranking with Ordinal
		Target Variables // Ordinal forests (OF) are a method for
		ordinal regression with high-dimensional and low-dimensional
		data that is able to predict the values of the ordinal target
		variable for new observations based on a training dataset.
		Using a (permutation-based) variable importance measure it is
		moreover possible to rank the covariates with respect to their
		importances in the prediction of the values of the ordinal
		target variable. OF will be presented in an upcoming technical
		report by Hornung et al.. The main functions of the package
		are: ordfor() (construction of OF) and predict.ordfor()
		(prediction of the target variable values of new observations).
