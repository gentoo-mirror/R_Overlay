		Ordinal Forests: Prediction and Class Width Inference with
		Ordinal Target Variables // Ordinal forests (OF) are a method
		for ordinal regression with high-dimensional and low-
		dimensional data that is able to predict the values of the
		ordinal target variable for new observations and at the same
		time estimate the relative widths of the classes of the ordinal
		target variable. Using a (permutation-based) variable
		importance measure it is moreover possible to rank the
		importances of the covariates. OF will be presented in an
		upcoming technical report by Hornung et al.. The main functions
		of the package are: ordfor() (construction of OF),
		predict.ordfor() (prediction of the target variable values of
		new observations), and plot.ordfor() (visualization of the
		estimated relative widths of the classes of the ordinal target
		variable).
