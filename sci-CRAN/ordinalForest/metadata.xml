		Ordinal Forests: Prediction and Variable Ranking with Ordinal
		Target Variables // The ordinal forest (OF) method allows
		ordinal regression with high-dimensional and low-dimensional
		data. After having constructed an OF prediction rule using a
		training dataset, it can be used to predict the values of the
		ordinal target variable for new observations. Moreover, by
		means of the (permutation-based) variable importance measure of
		OF, it is also possible to rank the covariates with respect to
		their importances in the prediction of the values of the
		ordinal target variable. OF is presented in Hornung (2019). The
		main functions of the package are: ordfor() (construction of
		OF) and predict.ordfor() (prediction of the target variable
		values of new observations). References: Hornung R. (2019)
