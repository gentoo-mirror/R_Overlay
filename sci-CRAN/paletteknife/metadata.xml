		Create Colour Scales and Legend from Continuous or Categorical
		Vectors // Streamlines the steps for adding colour scales and
		associated legends when working with base R graphics,
		especially for interactive use. Popular palettes are included
		and pretty legends produced when mapping a large variety of
		vector classes to a colour scale. An additional helper for
		adding axes and grid lines complements the base::plot() work
		flow.
