		Computation of Variance-Based Sensitivity Indices // It allows to
		rapidly compute, bootstrap and plot up to fourth-order
		Sobol'-based sensitivity indices using several state-of-the-art
		first and total-order estimators. Sobol' indices can be
		computed either for models that yield a scalar as a model
		output or for systems of differential equations. The package
		also provides a suit of benchmark tests functions and several
		options to obtain publication-ready figures of the model output
		uncertainty and sensitivity-related analysis. An overview of
		Sobol'-based sensitivity indices can be found in Saltelli et
		al. (2008, ISBN:9780470059975) and in Puy, Lo Piano, Saltelli,
		and Levin (2021) arXiv:2101.10103.
