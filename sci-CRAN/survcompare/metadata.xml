		Nested Cross-Validation to Compare Cox-PH, Cox-Lasso, Survival
		Random Forests // Performs repeated nested cross-validation for
		Cox Proportionate Hazards, Cox Lasso, Survival Random Forest,
		and their ensemble. Returns internally validated concordance
		index, time-dependent area under the curve, Brier score,
		calibration slope, and statistical testing of non-linear
		ensemble outperforming the baseline Cox model. In this, it
		helps researchers to quantify the gain of using a more complex
		survival model, or justify its redundancy. Equally, it shows
		the performance value of the non-linear and interaction terms,
		and may highlight the need of further feature transformation.
		Further details can be found in Shamsutdinova, Stamate,
		Roberts,  Stahl (2022) "Combining Cox Model and Tree-Based
		Algorithms to Boost Performance and Preserve Interpretability
		for Health Outcomes" doi:10.1007/978-3-031-08337-2_15, where
		the method is described as Ensemble 1.
