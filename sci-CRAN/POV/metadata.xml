		Partition of Variation Variance Component Analysis Method // An
		implementation of the Partition Of variation (POV) method as
		developed by Dr. Thomas A Little
		https://thomasalittleconsulting.com in 1993 for the analysis of
		semiconductor data for hard drive manufacturing. POV is based
		on sequential sum of squares and is an exact method that
		explains all observed variation. It quantitates both the
		between and within factor variation effects and can quantitate
		the influence of both continuous and categorical factors.
