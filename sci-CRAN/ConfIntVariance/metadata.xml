		Confidence Interval for the Univariate Population Variance
		without Normality Assumption // Surrounds the usual sample
		variance of a univariate numeric sample with a confidence
		interval for the population variance. This has been done so far
		only under the assumption that the underlying distribution is
		normal. Under the hood, this package implements the unique
		least-variance unbiased estimator of the variance of the sample
		variance, in a formula that is equivalent to estimating
		kurtosis and square of the population variance in an unbiased
		way and combining them according to the classical formula into
		an estimator of the variance of the sample variance. Both the
		sample variance and the estimator of its variance are
		U-statistics. By the theory of U-statistic, the resulting
		estimator is unique. See Fuchs, Krautenbacher (2016)
		doi:10.1080/15598608.2016.1158675 and the references therein
		for an overview of unbiased estimation of variances of
		U-statistics.
