		Handle Air Quality Data from the European Environment Agency Data
		Portal // This software downloads and manages air quality data
		from the European Environmental Agency (EEA) dataflow
		(https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/aqereporting-9).
		See the web page https://eeadmz1-downloads-
		webapp.azurewebsites.net/ for details on the EEA's Air Quality
		Download Service. The package allows dynamically mapping the
		stations, summarising and time aggregating the measurements and
		building spatial interpolation maps. See the web page
		https://www.eea.europa.eu/en for further information on EEA
		activities and history. Further details, as well as, an
		extended vignette of the main functions included in the
		package, are available at the GitHub web page dedicated to the
		project.
