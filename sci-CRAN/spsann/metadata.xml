		Optimization of Sample Configurations using Spatial Simulated
		Annealing // Methods to optimize sample configurations using
		spatial simulated annealing. Multiple objective functions are
		implemented for various purposes, such as variogram estimation,
		spatial trend estimation and spatial interpolation. A general
		purpose spatial simulated annealing function enables the user
		to define his/her own objective function. Solutions for
		augmenting existing sample configurations and solving multi-
		objective optimization problems are available as well.
