		Real-Time PCR Data Sets by Lievens et al. (2012) // Real-time
		quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data sets by
		Lievens et al. (2012) doi:10.1093/nar/gkr775. Provides one
		single tabular tidy data set in long format, encompassing three
		dilution series, targeted against the soybean Lectin endogene.
		Each dilution series was assayed in one of the following PCR-
		efficiency-modifying conditions: no PCR inhibition, inhibition
		by isopropanol and inhibition by tannic acid. The inhibitors
		were co-diluted along with the dilution series. The co-dilution
		series consists of a five-point, five-fold serial dilution. For
		each concentration there are 18 replicates. Each amplification
		curve is 60 cycles long. Original raw data file is available at
		the Supplementary Data section at Nucleic Acids Research Online
		doi:10.1093/nar/gkr775.
