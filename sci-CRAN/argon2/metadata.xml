		Secure Password Hashing // Utilities for secure password hashing
		via the argon2 algorithm. It is a relatively new hashing
		algorithm and is believed to be very secure. The 'argon2'
		implementation included in the package is the reference
		implementation.  The package also includes some utilities that
		should be useful for digest authentication, including a wrapper
		of 'blake2b'.  For similar R packages, see sodium and 'bcrypt'.
		See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2 or
		https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/430.pdf for more information.
