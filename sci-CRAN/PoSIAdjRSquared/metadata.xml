		Post-Selection Inference for Adjusted R Squared // Conduct post-
		selection inference for regression coefficients in linear
		models after they have been selected by adjusted R squared. The
		p-values and confidence intervals are valid after model
		selection with the same data. This allows the user to use all
		data for both model selection and inference without losing
		control over the type I error rate. The provided tests are more
		powerful than data splitting, which bases inference on less
		data since it discards all information used for selection.
