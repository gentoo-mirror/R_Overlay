		Implementation of the Natural and Orthogonal InterAction (NOIA)
		Model // The NOIA model, as described extensively in Alvarez-
		Castro  Carlborg (2007), is a framework facilitating the
		estimation of genetic effects and genotype-to-phenotype maps.
		This package provides the basic tools to perform linear and
		multilinear regressions from real populations (provided the
		phenotype and the genotype of every individuals), estimating
		the genetic effects from different reference points, the
		genotypic values, and the decomposition of genetic variances in
		a multi-locus, 2 alleles system. This package is presented in
		Le Rouzic  Alvarez-Castro (2008).
