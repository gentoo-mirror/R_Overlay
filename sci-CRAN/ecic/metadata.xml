		Extended Changes-in-Changes // Extends the Changes-in-Changes
		model a la Athey and Imbens (2006)
		doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00668.x to multiple cohorts and
		time periods, which generalizes difference-in-differences
		estimation techniques to the entire distribution. Computes
		quantile treatment effects for every possible two-by-two
		combination in ecic(). Then, aggregating all bootstrap runs
		adds the standard errors in summary_ecic(). Results can be
		plotted with plot_ecic() aggregated over all cohort-group
		combinations or in an event-study style for either individual
		periods or individual quantiles.
