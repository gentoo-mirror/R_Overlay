		Safe Anytime-Valid Inference // Functions to design and apply
		tests that are anytime valid. The functions can be used to
		design hypothesis tests in the prospective/randomised control
		trial setting or in the observational/retrospective setting.
		The resulting tests remain valid under both optional stopping
		and optional continuation. The current version includes safe
		t-tests and safe tests of two proportions. For details on the
		theory of safe tests, see Grunwald, de Heide and Koolen (2019)
		"Safe Testing" arXiv:1906.07801, for details on safe logrank
		tests see ter Schure, Perez-Ortiz, Ly and Grunwald (2020) "The
		Safe Logrank Test: Error Control under Continuous Monitoring
		with Unlimited Horizon" arXiv:2011.06931v3 and Turner, Ly and
		Grunwald (2021) "Safe Tests and Always-Valid Confidence
		Intervals for contingency tables and beyond" arXiv:2106.02693
		for details on safe contingency table tests.
