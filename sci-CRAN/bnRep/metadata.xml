		A Repository of Bayesian Networks from the Academic Literature //
		A collection of Bayesian networks (discrete, Gaussian, and
		conditional linear Gaussian) collated from recent academic
		literature. The 'bnRep_summary' object provides an overview of
		the Bayesian networks in the repository and the package
		documentation includes details about the variables in each
		network. A Shiny app to explore the repository can be launched
		with 'bnRep_app()' and is available online at
		https://manueleleonelli.shinyapps.io/bnRep. Reference: 'M.
		Leonelli' (2025) doi:10.1016/j.neucom.2025.129502.
