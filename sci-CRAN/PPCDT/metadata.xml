		An Optimal Subset Selection for Distributed Hypothesis Testing //
		In the era of big data, data redundancy and distributed
		characteristics present novel challenges to data analysis. This
		package introduces a method for estimating optimal subsets of
		redundant distributed data, based on PPCDT (Conjunction of
		Power and P-value in Distributed Settings). Leveraging PPC
		technology, this approach can efficiently extract valuable
		information from redundant distributed data and determine the
		optimal subset. Experimental results demonstrate that this
		method not only enhances data quality and utilization
		efficiency but also assesses its performance effectively. The
		philosophy of the package is described in Guo G. (2020)
