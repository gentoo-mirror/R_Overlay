		Simulations for Electrochemistry Experiments // Simulates cyclic
		voltammetry, linear-sweep voltammetry (both with and without
		stirring of the solution), and single-pulse and double-pulse
		chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry experiments using the
		implicit finite difference method outlined in Gosser (1993,
		ISBN: 9781560810261) and in Brown (2015)
		doi:10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225. Additional functions provide
		ways to display and to examine the results of these
		simulations. The primary purpose of this package is to provide
		tools for use in courses in analytical chemistry.
