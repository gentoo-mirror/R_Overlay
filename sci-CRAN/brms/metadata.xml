		Bayesian Regression Models using 'Stan' // Fit Bayesian
		generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using
		'Stan' for full Bayesian inference. A wide range of
		distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users
		to fit -- among others -- linear, robust linear, count data,
		survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and
		even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context.
		Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms,
		auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic
		standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all
		parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in
		order to perform distributional regression. Prior
		specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to
		apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.
		Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior
		predictive checks and leave-one-out cross-validation.
