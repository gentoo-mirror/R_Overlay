		Bayesian Regression Models using 'Stan' // Fit Bayesian
		generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using
		'Stan' for full Bayesian inference. A wide range of
		distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users
		to fit -- among others -- linear, robust linear, count data,
		survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and
		even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context.
		Further modeling options include both theory-driven and data-
		driven non-linear terms, auto-correlation structures, censoring
		and truncation, meta-analytic standard errors, and quite a few
		more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution
		can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression.
		Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage
		users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their
		prior knowledge. Models can easily be evaluated and compared
		using several methods assessing posterior or prior predictions.
