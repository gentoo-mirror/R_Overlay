		Feature Extraction and Model Estimation for Audio of Human Speech
		// Provides fast, easy feature extraction of human speech and
		model estimation with hidden Markov models. Flexible extraction
		of phonetic features and their derivatives, with necessary
		preprocessing options like feature standardization.
		Communication can estimate supervised and unsupervised hidden
		Markov models with these features, with cross validation and
		corrections for auto-correlation in features. Methods developed
		in Knox and Lucas (2021) doi:10.7910/DVN.8BTOHQ.
