		Conconi Estimate of Anaerobic Threshold from a TCX File //
		Analyzes data from a Conconi et al. (1996)
		doi:10.1055/s-2007-972887 treadmill fitness test where speed is
		augmented by a constant amount every set number of seconds to
		estimate the anaerobic (lactate) threshold speed and heart
		rate. It reads a TCX file, allows optional removal observations
		from before and after the actual test, fits a change-point
		linear model where the change-point is the estimate of the
		lactate threshold, and plots the data points and fit model.
		Details of administering the fitness test are provided in the
		package vignette. Functions work by default for Garmin Connect
		TCX exports but may require additional data preparation for
		heart rate, time, and speed data from other sources.
