		Test Stationarity using Bootstrap Wavelet Packet Tests //
		Provides significance tests for second-order stationarity for
		time series using bootstrap wavelet packet tests. Provides
		functionality to visualize the time series with the results of
		the hypothesis tests superimposed. The methodology is described
		in Cardinali, A and Nason, G P (2016) "Practical powerful
		wavelet packet tests for second-order stationarity." Applied
		and Computational Harmonic Analysis, 44, 558-585
