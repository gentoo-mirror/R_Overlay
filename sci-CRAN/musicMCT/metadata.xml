		Analyze the Structure of Musical Scales // Analysis of musical
		scales ( modes, grooves, etc.) in the vein of Sherrill 2025
		doi:10.1215/00222909-11595194. The initials MCT in the package
		title refer to the article's title: "Modal Color Theory."
		Offers support for conventional musical pitch class set theory
		as developed by Forte (1973, ISBN: 9780300016109) and David
		Lewin (1987, ISBN: 9780300034936), as well as for the
		continuous geometries of Callender, Quinn,  Tymoczko (2008)
		doi:10.1126/science.1153021. Identifies structural properties
		of scales and calculates derived values (sign vector, color
		number, brightness ratio, etc.). Creates plots such as
		"brightness graphs" which visualize these properties.
