		A Fast, Easy-to-Use Tool for Manipulating Tables in Databases and
		a Wrapper of MADlib // Provides an R interface for the 'VMware
		Data Stack' running on 'PostgreSQL' or 'Greenplum' databases
		with parallel and distributed computation ability for big data
		processing. 'PivotalR' provides an R interface to various
		database operations on tables or views. These operations are
		almost the same as the corresponding native R operations. Thus
		users of R do not need to learn 'SQL' when they operate on
		objects in the database. It also provides a wrapper for 'Apache
		MADlib', which is an open-source library for parallel and
		scalable in-database analytics.
