		Measuring Ecosystem Multi-Functionality and Its Decomposition //
		Provide simple functions to (i) compute a class of multi-
		functionality measures for a single ecosystem for given
		function weights, (ii) decompose gamma multi-functionality for
		pairs of ecosystems and K ecosystems (K can be greater than 2)
		into a within-ecosystem component (alpha multi-functionality)
		and an among-ecosystem component (beta multi-functionality). In
		each case, the correlation between functions can be corrected
		for. Based on biodiversity and ecosystem function data, this
		software also facilitates graphics for assessing biodiversity-
		ecosystem functioning relationships across scales.
