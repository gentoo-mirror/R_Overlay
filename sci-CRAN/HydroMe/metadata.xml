		Estimating Water Retention and Infiltration Model Parameters
		using Experimental Data // Contains functions for estimating
		the parameters of infiltration and water retention models using
		the curve-fitting methods as discussed in Omuto and Gumbe
		(2009) ("Estimating water infiltration and retention
		characteristics using a computer program in
		R"doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2008.08.011). The models considered are
		those that are commonly used in soil science. Version 2 of the
		package has new models for water retention characteristic
		curves.
