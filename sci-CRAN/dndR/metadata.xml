		Dungeons  Dragons Functions for Players and Dungeon Masters //
		The goal of 'dndR' is to provide a suite of Dungeons  Dragons
		related functions. This package is meant to be useful both to
		players and Dungeon Masters (DMs). Some functions apply to many
		tabletop role-playing games (e.g., dice rolling), but others
		are focused on Fifth Edition (a.k.a. "5e") and where possible
		both the 2014 and 2024 versions are supported.
