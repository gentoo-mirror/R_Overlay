		Dungeons  Dragons Functions for Players and Dungeon Masters //
		The goal of 'dndR' is to provide a suite of Dungeons  Dragons
		related functions. This package is meant to be useful both to
		players and Dungeon Masters (DMs). All functions currently
		focus on Fifth Edition (a.k.a. "5e") but once the next edition
		is published functions will likely be expanded to include any
		rule changes.
