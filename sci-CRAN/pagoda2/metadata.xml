		Single Cell Analysis and Differential Expression // Analyzing and
		interactively exploring large-scale single-cell RNA-seq
		datasets. 'pagoda2' primarily performs normalization and
		differential gene expression analysis, with an interactive
		application for exploring single-cell RNA-seq datasets. It
		performs basic tasks such as cell size normalization, gene
		variance normalization, and can be used to identify
		subpopulations and run differential expression within
		individual samples. 'pagoda2' was written to rapidly process
		modern large-scale scRNAseq datasets of approximately 1e6
		cells. The companion web application allows users to explore
		which gene expression patterns form the different
		subpopulations within your data. The package also serves as the
		primary method for preprocessing data for Conos,
		https://github.com/kharchenkolab/conos. This package interacts
		with data available through the 'p2data' package, which is
		available in a 'drat' repository. To access this data package,
		see the instructions at
		https://github.com/kharchenkolab/pagoda2. The size of the
		'p2data' package is approximately 6 MB.
