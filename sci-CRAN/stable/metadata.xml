		Probability Functions and Generalized Regression Models for
		Stable Distributions // Density, distribution, quantile and
		hazard functions of a stable variate; generalized regression
		models for the parameters of a stable distribution. See the
		README for how to make equivalent calls to those of
		'stabledist' (i.e., Nolan's 0-parameterization and
		1-parameterization as detailed in Nolan (2020)). See github for
		Lambert and Lindsey 1999 JRSS-C journal article, which details
		the parameterization of the Buck (1995) stable. See the Details
		section of the `?dstable` help file for context and references.
