		Test ANOVA Replications by Means of the Prior Predictive p-Value
		// Allows for the computation of a prior predictive p-value to
		test replication of relevant features of original ANOVA
		studies. Relevant features are captured in informative
		hypotheses. The package also allows for the computation of
		sample sizes for new studies, post-hoc power calculations, and
		comes with a Shiny application in which all calculations can be
		conducted as well.
