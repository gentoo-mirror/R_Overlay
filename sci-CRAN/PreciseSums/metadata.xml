		Accurate Floating Point Sums and Products // Most of the time
		floating point arithmetic does approximately the right thing.
		When adding sums or having products of numbers that greatly
		differ in magnitude, the floating point arithmetic may be
		incorrect.  This package implements the Kahan (1965) sum
		doi:10.1145/363707.363723, Neumaier (1974) sum
		doi:10.1002/zamm.19740540106, pairwise-sum (adapted from
		'NumPy', See Castaldo (2008) doi:10.1137/070679946 for a
		discussion of accuracy), and arbitrary precision sum (adapted
		from the fsum in 'Python' ; Shewchuk (1997)
		https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/robustr.pdf).  In
		addition, products are changed to long double precision for
		accuracy, or changed into a log-sum for accuracy.
