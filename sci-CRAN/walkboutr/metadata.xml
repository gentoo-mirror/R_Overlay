		Generate Walk Bouts from GPS and Accelerometry Data // Process
		GPS and accelerometry data to generate walk bouts. A walk bout
		is a period of activity with accelerometer movement matching
		the patterns of walking with corresponding GPS measurements
		that confirm travel. The inputs of the 'walkboutr' package are
		individual-level accelerometry and GPS data. The outputs of the
		model are walk bouts with corresponding times, duration, and
		summary statistics on the sample population, which collapse all
		personally identifying information. These bouts can be used to
		measure walking both as an outcome of a change to the built
		environment or as a predictor of health outcomes such as a
		cardioprotective behavior. Kang B, Moudon AV, Hurvitz PM,
