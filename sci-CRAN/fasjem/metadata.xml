		A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Learning Multiple Related
		Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models // This is an R implementation
		of "A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Learning Multiple
		Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models" (FASJEM). The FASJEM
		algorithm can be used to estimate multiple related precision
		matrices. For instance, it can identify context-specific gene
		networks from multi-context gene expression datasets. By
		performing data-driven network inference from high-dimensional
		and heterogonous data sets, this tool  can help users
		effectively translate aggregated data into knowledge that take
		the form of graphs among entities. Please run demo(fasjem) to
		learn the basic functions provided by this package. For more
		details, please see
