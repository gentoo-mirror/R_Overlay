		Spatiotemporal Autoregression Analyses for Large Data Sets //
		These tools were created to test map-scale hypotheses about
		trends in large remotely sensed data sets but any data with
		spatial and temporal variation can be analyzed. Tests are
		conducted using the PARTS method for analyzing spatially
		autocorrelated time series (Ives et al., 2021:
		doi:10.1016/j.rse.2021.112678). The method's unique approach
		can handle extremely large data sets that other spatiotemporal
		models cannot, while still appropriately accounting for spatial
		and temporal autocorrelation. This is done by partitioning the
		data into smaller chunks, analyzing chunks separately and then
		combining the separate analyses into a single, correlated test
		of the map-scale hypotheses.
