		LogNormal Response Time Item Response Theory Models // Allows the
		simultaneous analysis of responses and response times in an
		Item Response Theory (IRT) modelling framework. Supports
		variable person speed functions (intercept, trend, quadratic),
		and covariates for item and person (random) parameters. Data
		missing-by-design can be specified. Parameter estimation is
		done with a MCMC algorithm. LNIRT replaces the package CIRT,
		which was written by Rinke Klein Entink. For reference, see the
		paper by Fox, Klein Entink and Van der Linden (2007), "Modeling
		of Responses and Response Times with the Package cirt", Journal
		of Statistical Software, doi:10.18637/jss.v020.i07.
