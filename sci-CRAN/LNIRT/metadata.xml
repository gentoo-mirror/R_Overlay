		LogNormal Response Time Item Response Theory Models // Allows the
		simultaneous analysis of responses and response times in an
		Item Response Theory (IRT) modelling framework. Supports
		covariates for item and person (random) parameters. Parameter
		estimation is done with a MCMC algorithm. LNIRT replaces the
		package CIRT, which was written by Rinke Klein Entink. For
		reference, see the paper by Fox, Klein Entink and Van der
		Linden (2007), "Modeling of Responses and Response Times with
		the Package cirt", Journal of Statistical Software,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v020.i07.
