		Gaussian-Based Genome Representative Selector with Prioritization
		// Given a group of genomes and their relationship with each
		other, the package clusters the genomes and selects the most
		representative members of each cluster. Additional data can be
		provided to the prioritize certain genomes. The results can be
		printed out as a list or a new phylogeny with graphs of the
		trees and distance distributions also available. For detailed
		introduction see: Thomas H Clarke, Lauren M Brinkac, Granger
		Sutton, and Derrick E Fouts (2018), GGRaSP: a R-package for
		selecting representative genomes using Gaussian mixture models,
		Bioinformatics, bty300, doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty300.
