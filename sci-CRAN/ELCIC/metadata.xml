		The Empirical Likelihood-Based Consistent Information Criterion
		// We developed a consistent and robust information criterion
		to conduct model selection for semiparametric models. It is
		free of distribution specification and powerful to locate the
		true model given large sample size. This package provides
		several usage of ELCIC with applications in generalized linear
		model (GLM), generalized estimating equation (GEE) for
		longitudinal data, and weighted GEE (WGEE) for missing
		longitudinal data under the mechanism of missing at random and
		drop-out. Chixaing Chen, Ming Wang, Rongling Wu, Runze Li
