		Simulating and Modeling Group (Pooled) Testing Data // Provides
		an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm using the approach
		introduced in Warasi (2023) doi:10.1080/03610918.2021.2009867.
		The EM algorithm can be used to estimate the prevalence
		(overall proportion) of a disease and to estimate a binary
		regression model from among the class of generalized linear
		models based on group testing data. The estimation framework we
		consider offers a flexible and general approach; i.e., its
		application is not limited to any specific group testing
		protocol. Consequently, the EM algorithm can model data arising
		from simple pooling as well as advanced pooling such as
		hierarchical testing, array testing, and quality control
		pooling. Also, provided are functions that can be used to
		conduct the Wald tests described in Buse (1982)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.1982.10482817 and to simulate the group
		testing data described in Kim et al. (2007)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00817.x. We offer a function to
		compute relative efficiency measures, which can be used to
		optimize the maximum likelihood estimator of disease
		prevalence.
