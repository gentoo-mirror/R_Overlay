		Production Rules Based Classification of Migration // Provides
		mechanisms for classifying border crossings using a rules-based
		methodology. The goal of performing this type of classification
		is to identify any potential long-term migrants.  A long-term
		migration is defined as a border crossing involving a change in
		residence status. A border crossing counts as a long-term
		migration to/from a country if it entails a change from non-
		residence to residence / residence to non-residence.  The
		rules-based classification that used to determine a long-term
		migration is defined by a threshold duration and a test
		duration, alternatively named window size. Under a 12/16 rule,
		for instance, the threshold duration is 12 months and the test
		duration (window size) is 16 months. With a 9/12 rule, the
		threshold duration is 9 months and the test duration (window
		size)  is 12 months. For more information about the methodology
		applied, please visit Stats NZ (2020)

		travel-histories-and-the-1216-month-rule.
