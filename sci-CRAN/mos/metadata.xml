		Simulation and Moment Computation for Order Statistics //
		Provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with order
		statistics, including functions for simulating order
		statistics, censored samples (Type I and Type II), and record
		values from various continuous distributions. Additionally, it
		offers functions to compute moments (mean, variance, skewness,
		kurtosis) of order statistics for several continuous
		distributions. These tools assist researchers and statisticians
		in understanding and analyzing the properties of order
		statistics and related data. The methods and algorithms
		implemented in this package are based on several published
		works, including Ahsanullah et al (2013, ISBN:9789491216831),
		Arnold and Balakrishnan (2012, ISBN:1461236444), Harter and
		Balakrishnan (1996, ISBN:9780849394522), Balakrishnan and
		Sandhu (1995) doi:10.1080/00031305.1995.10476150, Gen (2012)
		doi:10.1007/s00362-010-0320-y, Makouei et al (2021)
		doi:10.1016/j.cam.2021.113386 and Nagaraja (2013)
