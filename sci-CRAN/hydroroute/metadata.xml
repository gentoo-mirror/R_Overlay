		Trace Longitudinal Hydropeaking Waves // Implements an empirical
		approach referred to as PeakTrace which uses multiple
		hydrographs to detect and follow hydropower plant-specific
		hydropeaking waves at the sub-catchment scale and to describe
		how hydropeaking flow parameters change along the longitudinal
		flow path. The method is based on the identification of
		associated events and uses (linear) regression models to
		describe translation and retention processes between
		neighboring hydrographs. Several regression model results are
		combined to arrive at a power plant-specific model. The
		approach is proposed and validated in Greimel et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1002/rra.3978. The identification of associated events
		is based on the event detection implemented in 'hydropeak'.
