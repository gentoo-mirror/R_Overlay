		Graphical Least Square Estimation // The Graphical Least Square
		Estimation 'GLSE' package consists of several functions. The
		first function (called GLSE()), which is the main function in
		this package, is for estimating linear regression via graphical
		models, especially when the number of observations is smaller
		than the number of variables. This function gives unbiased
		estimated regression models under some conditions on the
		predictors. Moreover, this function aims to deal with studies
		where all covariates need to be kept in the model (such as
		portfolio optimisation). The second function provides an
		estimation of the bootstrap standard errors of the 'GLSE'
		parameters. The third function generates data from multivariate
		normal distribution for regression purposes, and the fourth
		function generates data from multivariate t-distribution for
		the same purpose. Generating an undirected decomposable graph
		is carried out by the fifth function and its  decomposability
		is tested in the sixth function. The seventh function gives a
		perfect sequence of the cliques and separators of the given
		decomposable graph. Finally, the last function gives the plot
		of the decomposale graph. The package supports both serial and
		parallel computations for estimating the graph.The 'GLSE'
		package is an implementation of the method introduced in
		Aldahmani, S., and Dai, H. (2015) doi:10.5539/ijsp.v4n3p61.
