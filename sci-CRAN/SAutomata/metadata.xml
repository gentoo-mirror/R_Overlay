		Inference and Learning in Stochastic Automata // Machine learning
		provides algorithms that can learn from data and make
		inferences or predictions. Stochastic automata is a class of
		input/output devices which can model components. This work
		provides implementation an inference algorithm for stochastic
		automata which is similar to the Viterbi algorithm. Moreover,
		we specify a learning algorithm using the expectation-
		maximization technique and provide a more efficient
		implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for stochastic
		automata. This work is based on Inference and learning in
		stochastic automata was by Karl-Heinz Zimmermann(2017)
