		API Wrapper for U.S. Energy Information Administration ('EIA')
		Open Data // Provides API access to data from the U.S. Energy
		Information Administration ('EIA') https://www.eia.gov/. Use of
		the EIA's API and this package requires a free API key
		obtainable at https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php. This
		package includes functions for searching the EIA data directory
		and returning time series and geoset time series datasets.
		Datasets returned by these functions are provided by default in
		a tidy format, or alternatively, in more raw formats. It also
		offers helper functions for working with EIA date strings and
		time formats and for inspecting different summaries of series
		metadata. The package also provides control over API key
		storage and caching of API request results.
