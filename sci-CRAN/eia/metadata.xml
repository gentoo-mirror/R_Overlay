		API Wrapper for 'US Energy Information Administration' Open Data
		// Provides API access to data from the 'US Energy Information
		Administration' ('EIA') https://www.eia.gov/. Use of the API
		requires a free API key obtainable at
		https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php. The package includes
		functions for searching 'EIA' data categories and importing
		time series and geoset time series datasets. Datasets returned
		by these functions are provided in a tidy format or
		alternatively in more raw form. It also offers helper functions
		for working with 'EIA' date strings and time formats and for
		inspecting different summaries of series metadata. The package
		also provides control over API key storage and caching of API
		request results. This package has been peer-reviewed by
		rOpenSci (v. 0.3.4).
