		Obtain Unweighted Natural Strata that Balance Many Covariates //
		Natural strata fix a constant ratio of controls to treated
		units within each stratum. This ratio need not be an integer.
		The control units are chosen using randomized rounding of a
		linear program that balances many covariates. To solve the
		linear program, the 'Gurobi' commercial optimization software
		is recommended, but not required. The 'gurobi' R package can be
		installed following the instructions at https://www.gurobi.com/
		documentation/9.1/refman/ins_the_r_package.html.
