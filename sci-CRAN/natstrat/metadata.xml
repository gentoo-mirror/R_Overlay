		Obtain Unweighted Natural Strata that Balance Many Covariates //
		Natural strata can be used in observational studies to balance
		the distributions of many covariates across any number of
		treatment groups and any number of comparisons. These strata
		have proportional amounts of units within each stratum across
		the treatments, allowing for simple interpretation and
		aggregation across strata. Within each stratum, the units are
		chosen using randomized rounding of a linear program that
		balances many covariates. To solve the linear program, the
		'Gurobi' commercial optimization software is recommended, but
		not required. The 'gurobi' R package can be installed following
		the instructions at https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/re
		fman/ins_the_r_package.html.
