		Large-Scale Hypothesis Testing by Variance Mixing // Implements
		large-scale hypothesis testing by variance mixing. It takes two
		statistics per testing unit -- an estimated effect and its
		associated squared standard error -- and fits a nonparametric,
		shape-constrained mixture separately on two latent parameters.
		It reports local false discovery rates (lfdr) and local false
		sign rates (lfsr). Manuscript describing algorithm of MixTwice:
