		Catalogues of Resolution IV 128 Run 2-Level Fractional Factorials
		Up to 33 Factors that Do Have 5-Letter Words // Catalogues of
		resolution IV regular fractional factorial designs in 128 runs
		are provided for up to 33 2-level factors. The catalogues are
		complete, excluding resolution IV designs without 5-letter
		words, because these do not add value for a search for
		unblocked clear designs. The previous package version 1.0 with
		complete catalogues up to 24 runs (24 runs and a namespace
		added later) can be downloaded from the authors website.
