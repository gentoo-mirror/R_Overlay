		Fit Continuous-Time State-Space Models for Filtering Argos
		Satellite (and Other) Telemetry Data // Fits continuous-time
		random walk and correlated random walk state-space models to
		filter Argos satellite location data. Template Model Builder
		('TMB') is used for fast estimation. The Argos data can be:
		(older) least squares-based locations; (newer) Kalman filter-
		based locations with error ellipse information; or a mixture of
		both. Separate measurement models are used for these two data
		types. The models estimate two sets of location states
		corresponding to: 1) each observation, which are (usually)
		irregularly timed; and 2) user-specified time intervals
		(regular or irregular). Jonsen I, McMahon CR, Patterson TA,
