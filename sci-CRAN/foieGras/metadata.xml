		Fit Continuous-Time State-Space and Latent Variable Models for
		Quality Control of Argos Satellite (and Other) Telemetry Data
		and for Estimating Movement Behaviour // Fits continuous-time
		random walk and correlated random walk state-space models for
		quality control animal tracking data ('Argos', processed light-
		level 'geolocation', 'GPS'). Template Model Builder ('TMB') is
		used for fast estimation. The 'Argos' data can be: (older)
		least squares-based locations; (newer) Kalman filter-based
		locations with error ellipse information; or a mixture of both.
		The models estimate two sets of location states corresponding
		to: 1) each observation, which are (usually) irregularly timed;
		and 2) user-specified time intervals (regular or irregular).
		Latent variable models are provided to estimate move
		persistence along tracks as an index of behaviour. 'Jonsen I',
