		Software Tools to Quantify Structural Importance of Nodes in a
		Network // Provides functionality to compute various node
		centrality measures on networks. Included are functions to
		compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and
		Bader's SNAP library), implementations of constraint and
		effective network size by Burt (2000)
		doi:10.1016/S0191-3085(00)22009-1; algorithm to identify key
		players by Borgatti (2006) doi:10.1007/s10588-006-7084-x; and
		the bridging algorithm by Valente and Fujimoto (2010)
		doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.003. On Unix systems, the
		betweenness, Key Players, and bridging implementations are
		parallelized with OpenMP, which may run faster on systems which
		have OpenMP configured.
