		Calibrated Color Ramps // Value-calibrated color ramps can be
		useful to emphasize patterns in data from complex
		distributions. Colors can be tied to specific values, and the
		association can be expanded into full color ramps that also
		include the relationship between colors and values. Such ramps
		can be used in a variety of cases when heatmap-type plots are
		necessary, including the visualization of vector and raster
		spatial data, such as topographies.
