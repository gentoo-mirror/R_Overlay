		One-Way Heteroscedastic ANOVA Tests // Contains several one-way
		heteroscedastic ANOVA tests such as Alexander-Govern, Alvandi
		et al. Generalized F, Approximate F, Box F, Brown-Forsythe, B2,
		Cochran F, Fiducial Approach, Generalized F, Johansen F,
		Modified Brown-Forsythe, Modified Welch, One-Stage, One-Stage
		Range, Parametric Bootstrap, Permutation F, Scott-Smith, Welch
		and Welch-Aspin test. These tests are used to test the equality
		of group means under unequal variance. Furthermore, a modified
		version of Generalized F-test is improved to test the equality
		of non-normal group means under unequal variances. Tukey's bi-
		square estimators, one-step Tukey's bi-square estimators,
		Andrew's wave estimator, one-step Andrew's wave estimators,
		Huber's M-estimators are used to modify Generalized F-test.
