		Working with Precision Teaching Values // An implementation of an
		S3 class based on a double vector for storing and displaying
		precision teaching measures, representing a growing or a
		decaying (multiplicative) change between two frequencies. The
		main format method allows researchers to display measures
		(including data.frame) that respect the established conventions
		in the precision teaching community (i.e., prefixed
		multiplication or division symbol, displayed number = 1). Basic
		multiplication and division methods are allowed and other
		useful functions are provided for creating, converting or
		inverting precision teaching measures. For more details, see
		Pennypacker, Gutierrez and Lindsley (2003, ISBN:
		1-881317-13-7).
