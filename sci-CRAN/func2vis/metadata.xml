		Clean and Visualize Over Expression Results from
		'ConsensusPathDB' // Provides functions to have visualization
		and clean-up of enriched gene ontologies (GO) terms, protein
		complexes and pathways (obtained from multiple databases) using
		'ConsensusPathDB' from gene set over-expression analysis.
		Performs clustering of pathway based on similarity of over-
		expressed gene sets and visualizations similar to Ingenuity
		Pathway Analysis (IPA) when up and down regulated genes are
		known. The methods are described in a paper currently submitted
		by Orecchioni et al, 2020 in Nanoscale.
