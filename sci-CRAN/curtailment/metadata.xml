		Finds Binary Outcome Designs Using Stochastic Curtailment //
		Finds single- and two-arm designs using stochastic curtailment,
		as described by Law et al. (2019) arXiv:1909.03017 and Law et
		al. (2021) doi:10.1002/pst.2067 respectively. Designs can be
		single-stage or multi-stage. Non-stochastic curtailment is
		possible as a special case. Desired error-rates, maximum sample
		size and lower and upper anticipated response rates are
		inputted and suitable designs are returned with operating
		characteristics. Stopping boundaries and visualisations are
		also available. The package can find designs using other
		approaches, for example designs by Simon (1989)
		doi:10.1016/0197-2456(89)90015-9 and Mander and Thompson (2010)
		doi:10.1016/j.cct.2010.07.008. Other features: compare and
		visualise designs using a weighted sum of expected sample sizes
		under the null and alternative hypotheses and maximum sample
		size; visualise any binary outcome design.
