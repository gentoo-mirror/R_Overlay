		Fiber Length Determination // Routines for estimating tree fiber
		(tracheid) length distributions in the standing tree based on
		increment core samples. Two types of data can be used with the
		package, increment core data measured by means of an optical
		fiber analyzer (OFA), e.g. such as the Kajaani Fiber Lab, or
		measured by microscopy. Increment core data analyzed by OFAs
		consist of the cell lengths of both cut and uncut fibres
		(tracheids) and fines (such as ray parenchyma cells) without
		being able to identify which cells are cut or if they are fines
		or fibres. The microscopy measured data consist of the observed
		lengths of the uncut fibres in the increment core. A censored
		version of a mixture of the fine and fiber length distributions
		is proposed to fit the OFA data, under distributional
		assumptions (Svensson et al., 2006)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9469.2006.00501.x. The package offers two
		choices for the assumptions of the underlying density functions
		of the true fiber (fine) lenghts of those fibers (fines) that
		at least partially appear in the increment core, being the
		generalized gamma and the log normal densities.
