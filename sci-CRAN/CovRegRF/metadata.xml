		Covariance Regression with Random Forests // Covariance
		Regression with Random Forests ('CovRegRF') is a random forest
		method for estimating the covariance matrix of a multivariate
		response given a set of covariates. Random forest trees are
		built with a new splitting rule which is designed to maximize
		the distance between the sample covariance matrix estimates of
		the child nodes. The method is described in Alakus et al.
		(2022) arXiv:2209.08173. 'CovRegRF' uses 'randomForestSRC'
		package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2022)
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForestSRC by freezing
		at the version 3.1.0. The custom splitting rule feature is
		utilised to apply the proposed splitting rule.
