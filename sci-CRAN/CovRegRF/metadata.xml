		Covariance Regression with Random Forests // Covariance
		Regression with Random Forests ('CovRegRF') is a random forest
		method for estimating the covariance matrix of a multivariate
		response given a set of covariates. Random forest trees are
		built with a new splitting rule which is designed to maximize
		the distance between the sample covariance matrix estimates of
		the child nodes. The method is described in Alakus et al.
		(2023) doi:10.1186/s12859-023-05377-y. 'CovRegRF' uses
		'randomForestSRC' package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2022)
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForestSRC by freezing
		at the version 3.1.0. The custom splitting rule feature is
		utilised to apply the proposed splitting rule. 'LAPACK' and
		'BLAS' libraries are used for matrix decompositions. The
		'CovRegRF' package includes the header files 'lapacke.h' and
		'cblas.h' from the 'LAPACK' and 'BLAS' libraries. The 'LAPACK'
		library is licensed under modified BSD license.
