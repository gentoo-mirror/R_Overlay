		'Java' Environments for R Projects // Quickly install 'Java
		Development Kit (JDK)' without administrative privileges and
		set environment variables in current R session or project to
		solve common issues with 'Java' environment management in 'R'.
		Recommended to users of 'Java'/'rJava'-dependent 'R' packages
		such as 'r5r', 'opentripplanner', 'xlsx', 'openNLP', 'rWeka',
		'RJDBC', 'tabulapdf', and many more. 'rJavaEnv' prevents common
		problems like 'Java' not found, 'Java' version conflicts,
		missing 'Java' installations, and the inability to install
		'Java' due to lack of administrative privileges.  'rJavaEnv'
		automates the download, installation, and setup of the 'Java'
		on a per-project basis by setting the relevant 'JAVA_HOME' in
		the current 'R' session or the current working directory (via
		'.Rprofile', with the user's consent). Similar to what 'renv'
		does for 'R' packages, 'rJavaEnv' allows different 'Java'
		versions to be used across different projects, but can also be
		configured to allow multiple versions within the same project
		(e.g.  with the help of 'targets' package). Note: there are a
		few extra steps for 'Linux' users, who don't have any 'Java'
		previously installed in their system, and who prefer package
		installation from source, rather then installing binaries from
		'Posit Package Manager'. See documentation for details.
