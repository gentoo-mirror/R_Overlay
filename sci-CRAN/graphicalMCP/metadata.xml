		Graphical Multiple Comparison Procedures // Multiple comparison
		procedures (MCPs) control the familywise error rate in clinical
		trials. Graphical MCPs include many commonly used procedures as
		special cases; see Bretz et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1002/bimj.201000239, Lu (2016) doi:10.1002/sim.6985, and
		Xi et al. (2017) doi:10.1002/bimj.201600233. This package is a
		low-dependency implementation of graphical MCPs which allow
		mixed types of tests. It also includes power simulations and
		visualization of graphical MCPs.
