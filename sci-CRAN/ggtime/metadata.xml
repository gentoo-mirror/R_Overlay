		Visualization // Extends the capabilities of 'ggplot2' by
		providing grammatical elements and plot helpers designed for
		visualizing temporal patterns. The package implements a grammar
		of temporal graphics, which leverages calendar structures to

		helper functions to quickly produce commonly used time series
		graphics, including time plots, season plots, and seasonal sub-
		series plots.
