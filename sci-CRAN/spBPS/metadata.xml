		Bayesian Predictive Stacking for Scalable Geospatial Transfer
		Learning // Provides functions for Bayesian Predictive Stacking
		within the Bayesian transfer learning framework for geospatial
		artificial systems, as introduced in "Bayesian Transfer
		Learning for Artificially Intelligent Geospatial Systems: A
		Predictive Stacking Approach" (Presicce and Banerjee, 2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2410.09504. This methodology enables
		efficient Bayesian geostatistical modeling, utilizing
		predictive stacking to improve inference across spatial
		datasets. The core functions leverage 'C++' for high-
		performance computation, making the framework well-suited for
		large-scale spatial data analysis in parallel and distributed
		computing environments. Designed for scalability, it allows
		seamless application in computationally demanding scenarios.
