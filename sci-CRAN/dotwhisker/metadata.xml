		Dot-and-Whisker Plots of Regression Results // Create quick and
		easy dot-and-whisker plots of regression results. It takes as
		input either (1) a coefficient table in standard form or (2)
		one (or a list of) fitted model objects (of any type that has
		methods implemented in the 'parameters' package). It returns
		'ggplot' objects that can be further customized using tools
		from the 'ggplot2' package. The package also includes helper
		functions for tasks such as rescaling coefficients or
		relabeling predictor variables. See more methodological
		discussion of the visualization and data management methods
		used in this package in Kastellec and Leoni (2007)
