		R for High-Dimensional Omic Data // Represents high-dimensional
		data as tables of features, samples and measurements, and a
		design list for tracking the meaning of individual variables.
		Using this format, filtering, normalization, and other
		transformations of a dataset can be carried out in a flexible
		manner. 'romic' takes advantage of these transformations to
		create interactive 'shiny' apps for exploratory data analysis
		such as an interactive heatmap.
