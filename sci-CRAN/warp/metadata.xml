		Group Dates // Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods
		including: yearly, monthly, by second, by week of the month,
		and more. The groups are defined in such a way that they also
		represent the distance between dates in terms of the period.
		This extracts valuable information that can be used in further
		calculations that rely on a specific temporal spacing between
		observations.
