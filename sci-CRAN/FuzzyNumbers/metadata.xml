		deal with fuzzy numbers. They allow for computing any
		arithmetic operations (e.g., by using the Zadeh extension
		principle), performing approximation of arbitrary FNs by
		trapezoidal and piecewise linear FNs, preparing plots of FNs
		for publications, computing possibility and necessity values
		for comparisons, etc.
