		Visualization of Categorical Response Models // Notice: The
		package EffectStars2 provides a more up-to-date implementation
		of effect stars! EffectStars provides functions to visualize
		regression models with categorical response as proposed by Tutz
		and Schauberger (2013) doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.701379. The
		effects of the variables are plotted with star plots in order
		to allow for an optical impression of the fitted model.
