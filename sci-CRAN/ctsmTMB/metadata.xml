		Continuous Time Stochastic Modelling using Template Model Builder
		// Perform state and parameter inference, and forecasting, in
		stochastic state-space systems using the 'ctsmTMB' class. This
		class, built with the 'R6' package, provides a user-friendly
		interface for defining and handling state-space models.
		Inference is based on maximum likelihood estimation, with
		derivatives efficiently computed through automatic
		differentiation enabled by the 'TMB'/'RTMB' packages
		(Kristensen et al., 2016) doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i05. The
		available inference methods include Kalman filters, in addition
		to a Laplace approximation-based smoothing method. For further
		details of these methods refer to the documentation of the
		'CTSMR' package https://ctsm.info/ctsmr-reference.pdf and
		Thygesen (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2503.21358. Forecasting
		capabilities include moment predictions and stochastic path
		simulations, both implemented in 'C++' using 'Rcpp'
		(Eddelbuettel et al., 2018) doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375990
		for computational efficiency.
