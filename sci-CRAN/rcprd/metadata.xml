		Extraction and Management of Clinical Practice Research Datalink
		Data // Simplify the process of extracting and processing
		Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data in order to
		build datasets ready for statistical analysis. This process is
		difficult in 'R', as the raw data is very large and cannot be
		read into the R workspace. 'rcprd' utilises 'RSQLite' to create
		'SQLite' databases which are stored on the hard disk. These are
		then  queried to extract the required information for a cohort
		of interest, and create datasets ready for statistical
		analysis. The  processes follow closely that from the 'rEHR'
		package, see Springate et al., (2017)
