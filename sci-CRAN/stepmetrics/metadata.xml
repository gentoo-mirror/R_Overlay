		Calculate Step and Cadence Metrics from Wearable Data // Provides
		functions to calculate step- and cadence-based metrics from
		timestamped accelerometer and wearable device data. Supports
		CSV and AGD files from 'ActiGraph' devices, CSV files from
		'Fitbit' devices, and step counts derived with R package 'GGIR'
		https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR, with automatic handling of
		epoch lengths from 1 to 60 seconds. Metrics include total
		steps, cadence peaks, minutes and steps in predefined cadence
		bands, and time and steps in moderate-to-vigorous physical
		activity (MVPA). Methods and thresholds are informed by the
		literature, e.g., Tudor-Locke and Rowe (2012)

		doi:10.1136/bjsports-2017-097628. The package record is also
		available on Zenodo (2023) doi:10.5281/zenodo.7858094.
