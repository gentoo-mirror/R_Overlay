		Transformed Additive Gaussian Processes // Implement the
		transformed additive Gaussian (TAG) process and the
		transformed approximately additive Gaussian (TAAG) process
		proposed in Lin and Joseph (2020)
		DOI:10.1080/00401706.2019.1665592. These functions can be used
		to model deterministic computer experiments, obtain predictions
		at new inputs, and quantify the uncertainty of the predictions.
		This research is supported by a U.S. National Science
		Foundation grant DMS-1712642 and a U.S. Army Research Office
		grant W911NF-17-1-0007.
