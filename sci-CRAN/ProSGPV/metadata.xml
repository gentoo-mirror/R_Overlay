		Penalized Regression with Second-Generation P-Values //
		Implementation of penalized regression with second-generation
		p-values for variable selection. The one-stage algorithm is
		extremely fast and the two-stage algorithm has lower parameter
		estimation bias when data are highly correlated. S3 methods
		print(), summary(), coef(), and predict() are available for
		both algorithms, and S3 method plot() is available for the two-
		stage algorithm. Technical details of the algorithms can be
		found at arXiv:2012.07941.
