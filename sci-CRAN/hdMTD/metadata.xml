		Inference for High-Dimensional Mixture Transition Distribution
		Models // Estimates parameters in Mixture Transition
		Distribution (MTD) models, a class of high-order Markov chains.
		The set of relevant pasts (lags) is selected using either the
		Bayesian Information Criterion or the Forward Stepwise and Cut
		algorithms. Other model parameters (e.g. transition
		probabilities and oscillations) can be estimated via maximum
		likelihood estimation or the Expectation-Maximization
		algorithm. Additionally, 'hdMTD' includes a perfect sampling
		algorithm that generates samples of an MTD model from its
		invariant distribution. For theory, see Ost  Takahashi (2023)
		http://jmlr.org/papers/v24/22-0266.html.
