		Non-Additive Measure and Integral Manipulation Functions // S4
		tool box for capacity (or non-additive measure, fuzzy measure)
		and integral manipulation in a finite setting. It contains
		routines for handling various types of set functions such as
		games or capacities. It can be used to compute several non-
		additive integrals: the Choquet integral, the Sugeno integral,
		and the symmetric and asymmetric Choquet integrals. An analysis
		of capacities in terms of decision behavior can be performed
		through the computation of various indices such as the Shapley
		value, the interaction index, the orness degree, etc. The well-
		known Mbius transform, as well as other equivalent
		representations of set functions can also be computed. Kappalab
		further contains seven capacity identification routines: three
		least squares based approaches, a method based on linear
		programming, a maximum entropy like method based on variance
		minimization, a minimum distance approach and an unsupervised
		approach based on parametric entropies. The functions contained
		in Kappalab can for instance be used in the framework of
		multicriteria decision making or cooperative game theory.
