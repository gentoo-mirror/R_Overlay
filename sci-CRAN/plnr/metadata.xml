		A System for Planing Analyses // A system to plan analyses within
		the mental model where you have one (or more) datasets and want
		to run either A) the same function multiple times with
		different arguments, or B) multiple functions. This is
		appropriate when you have multiple strata (e.g. locations, age
		groups) that you want to apply the same function to, or you
		have multiple variables (e.g. exposures) that you want to apply
		the same statistical method to, or when you are creating the
		output for a report and you need multiple different tables or
		graphs.
