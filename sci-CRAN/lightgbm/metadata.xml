		Light Gradient Boosting Machine // Tree based algorithms can be
		improved by introducing boosting frameworks. 'LightGBM' is one
		such framework, based on Ke, Guolin et al. (2017)
		https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-
		gradient-boosting-decision. This package offers an R interface
		to work with it. It is designed to be distributed and efficient
		with the following advantages: 1. Faster training speed and
		higher efficiency. 2. Lower memory usage. 3. Better accuracy.
		4. Parallel learning supported. 5. Capable of handling large-
		scale data. In recognition of these advantages, 'LightGBM' has
		been widely-used in many winning solutions of machine learning
		competitions. Comparison experiments on public datasets suggest
		that 'LightGBM' can outperform existing boosting frameworks on
		both efficiency and accuracy, with significantly lower memory
		consumption. In addition, parallel experiments suggest that in
		certain circumstances, 'LightGBM' can achieve a linear speed-up
		in training time by using multiple machines.
