		MultiLinear Algebra // A set of tools for basic tensor operators.
		A tensor in the context of data analysis in a multidimensional
		array. The tools in this package rely on using any discrete
		transformation (e.g. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)).  Standard
		tools included are the Eigenvalue decomposition of a tensor,
		the QR decomposition and LU decomposition.  Other functionality
		includes the inverse of a tensor and the transpose of a
		symmetric tensor. Functionality in the package is outlined in
		Kernfeld et al. (2015) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/ar
		ticle/pii/S0024379515004358.
