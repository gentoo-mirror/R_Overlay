		Proportional Testing for Colocalisation Analysis //
		Colocalisation analysis tests whether two traits share a causal
		genetic variant in a specified genomic region. Proportional
		testing for colocalisation has been previously proposed
		[Wallace (2013) doi:10.1002/gepi.21765], but is reimplemented
		here to overcome barriers to its adoption. Its use is
		complementary to the fine- mapping based colocalisation method
		in the 'coloc' package, and may be used in particular to
		identify false "H3" conclusions in 'coloc'.
