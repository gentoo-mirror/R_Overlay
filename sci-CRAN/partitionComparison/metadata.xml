		Implements Measures for the Comparison of Two Partitions //
		Provides several measures ((dis)similarity, distance/metric,
		correlation, entropy) for comparing two partitions of the same
		set of objects. The different measures can be assigned to three
		different classes: Pair comparison (containing the famous
		Jaccard and Rand indices), set based, and information theory
		based. Many of the implemented measures can be found in
		Albatineh AN, Niewiadomska-Bugaj M and Mihalko D (2006)
		doi:10.1007/s00357-006-0017-z and Meila M (2007)
		doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2006.11.013. Partitions are represented by
		vectors of class labels which allow a straightforward
		integration with existing clustering algorithms (e.g.
		kmeans()). The package is mostly based on the S4 object system.
