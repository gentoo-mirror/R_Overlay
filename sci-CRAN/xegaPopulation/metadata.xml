		Genetic Population Level Functions // This collection of gene
		representation-independent functions implements the population
		layer of extended evolutionary and genetic algorithms and its
		support. The population layer consists of functions for
		initializing, logging, observing, evaluating a population of
		genes, as well as of computing the next population. For
		parallel evaluation of a population of genes 4 execution models
		- named Sequential, MultiCore, FutureApply, and Cluster - are
		provided. They are implemented by configuring the lapply()
		function. The execution model FutureApply can be externally
		configured as recommended by Bengtsson (2021)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048. Configurable acceptance rules and
		cooling schedules (see Kirkpatrick, S., Gelatt, C. D. J, and
		Vecchi, M. P. (1983) doi:10.1126/science.220.4598.671, and
		Aarts, E., and Korst, J. (1989, ISBN:0-471-92146-7) offer
		simulated annealing or greedy randomized approximate search
		procedure elements. Adaptive crossover and mutation rates
		depending on population statistics generalize the approach of
		Stanhope, S. A. and Daida, J. M. (1996, ISBN:0-18-201-031-7).
