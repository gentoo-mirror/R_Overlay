		Spatial Dependence: Weighting Schemes, Statistics and Models // A
		collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix
		objects from polygon 'contiguities', from point patterns by
		distance and tessellations, for summarizing these objects, and
		for permitting their use in spatial data analysis, including
		regional aggregation by minimum spanning tree; a collection of
		tests for spatial 'autocorrelation', including global 'Morans
		I', 'APLE', 'Gearys C', 'Hubert/Mantel' general cross product
		statistic, Empirical Bayes estimates and 'Assuno/Reis' Index,
		'Getis/Ord' G and multicoloured join count statistics, local
		'Moran's I' and 'Getis/Ord' G, 'saddlepoint' approximations,
		exact tests for global and local 'Moran's I' and 'LOSH' local
		indicators of spatial heteroscedasticity; and functions for
		estimating spatial simultaneous 'autoregressive' ('SAR') lag,
		error, general nested spatial and 'SARAR' models using maximum
		likelihood and 'MCMC', impact measures for lag, spatial
		'Durbin', 'SLX', spatial 'Durbin' error, 'SARAR' and 'GNS'
		models, weighted and 'unweighted' 'SAR' and 'CAR' spatial
		regression models, semi-parametric and Moran 'eigenvector'
		spatial filtering, 'GM SAR' error models, and generalized
		spatial two stage least squares models.
