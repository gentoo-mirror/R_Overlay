		Air Quality Data Analysis // Utilities for working with hourly
		air quality monitoring data with a focus on small particulates
		(PM2.5). A compact data model is structured as a list with two
		dataframes. A 'meta' dataframe contains spatial and measuring
		device metadata associated with deployments at known locations.
		A 'data' dataframe contains a 'datetime' column followed by
		columns of measurements associated with each "device-
		deployment". Algorithms to calculate NowCast and the associated
		Air Quality Index (AQI) are defined at the US Environmental
		Projection Agency AirNow program:
