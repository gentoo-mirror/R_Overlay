		Automated Covariate Selection Using HDPS Algorithm // Contains
		functions to implement automated covariate selection using
		methods described in the high-dimensional propensity score
		(HDPS) algorithm by Schneeweiss et.al. Covariate adjustment in
		real-world-observational-data (RWD) is important for for
		estimating adjusted outcomes and this can be done by using
		methods such as, but not limited to, propensity score matching,
		propensity score weighting and regression analysis. While these
		methods strive to statistically adjust for confounding, the
		major challenge is in selecting the potential covariates that
		can bias the outcomes comparison estimates in observational RWD
		(Real-World-Data). This is where the utility of automated
		covariate selection comes in. The functions in this package
		help to implement the three major steps of automated covariate
		selection as described by Schneeweiss et. al elsewhere. These
		three functions, in order of the steps required to execute
		automated covariate selection are, get_candidate_covariates(),
		get_recurrence_covariates() and get_prioritised_covariates().
		In addition to these functions, a sample real-world-data from
		publicly available de-identified medical claims data is also
		available for running examples and also for further
		exploration. The original article where the algorithm is
		described by Schneeweiss et.al. (2009)
