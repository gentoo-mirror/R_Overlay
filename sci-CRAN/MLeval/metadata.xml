		Machine Learning Model Evaluation // Straightforward and detailed
		evaluation of machine learning models. 'MLeval' can produce
		receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-
		recall (PR) curves, calibration curves, and PR gain curves.
		'MLeval' accepts a data frame of class probabilities and ground
		truth labels, or, it can automatically interpret the Caret
		train function results from repeated cross validation, then
		select the best model and analyse the results. 'MLeval'
		produces a range of evaluation metrics with confidence
		intervals.
