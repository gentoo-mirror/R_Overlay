		Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic for Set-Based Inference //
		Offers the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test for set-based
		inference in genetic association studies. The GBJ is designed
		as an alternative to tests such as Berk-Jones (BJ), Higher
		Criticism (HC), Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC), Minimum
		p-value (minP), and Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT).
		All of these other methods (except for SKAT) are also
		implemented in this package, and we  additionally provide an
		omnibus test (OMNI) which integrates information from each of
		the tests. The GBJ has been shown to outperform other tests in
		genetic association studies when signals are correlated and
		moderately sparse. For more details, please ask for a preprint
		of our manuscript or see the vignette for a quickstart guide.
