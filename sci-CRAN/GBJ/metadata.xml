		Generalized Berk-Jones Test for Set-Based Inference in Genetic
		Association Studies // Offers the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ)
		test for set-based inference in genetic association studies.
		The GBJ is designed as an alternative to tests such as Berk-
		Jones (BJ), Higher Criticism (HC), Generalized Higher Criticism
		(GHC), Minimum p-value (minP), and Sequence Kernel Association
		Test (SKAT). All of these other methods (except for SKAT) are
		also implemented in this package, and we additionally provide
		an omnibus test (OMNI) which integrates information from each
		of the tests. The GBJ has been shown to outperform other tests
		in genetic association studies when signals are correlated and
		moderately sparse. Please see the vignette for a quickstart
		guide or the paper at doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1660170 for
		full details.
