		Test Coverage for Packages // Track and report code coverage for
		your package and (optionally) upload the results to a coverage
		service like Codecov (http://codecov.io) or Coveralls
		(http://coveralls.io).  Code coverage is a measure of the
		amount of code being exercised by the tests.  It is an indirect
		measure of test quality. This package is compatible with any
		testing methodology or framework and tracks coverage of both R
		code and compiled C/C++/Fortran code.
