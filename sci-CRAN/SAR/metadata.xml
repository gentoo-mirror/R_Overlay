		Smart Adaptive Recommendations // 'Smart Adaptive
		Recommendations' (SAR) is the name of a fast, scalable,
		adaptive algorithm for personalized recommendations based on
		user transactions and item descriptions. It produces easily
		explainable/interpretable recommendations and handles "cold
		item" and "semi-cold user" scenarios. This package provides two
		implementations of 'SAR': a standalone implementation, and an
		interface to a web service in Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud:
		https://github.com/Microsoft/Product-
		Recommendations/blob/master/doc/sar.md. The former allows fast
		and easy experimentation, and the latter provides robust
		scalability and extra features for production use.
