		Easy Use of R via Shiny App for Basic Analyses of Experimental
		Data // Runs a Shiny App in the local machine for basic
		statistical and graphical analyses. The point-and-click
		interface of Shiny App enables obtaining the same analysis
		outputs (e.g., plots and tables) more quickly, as compared with
		typing the required code in R, especially for users without
		much experience or expertise with coding. Examples of possible
		analyses include tabulating descriptive statistics for a
		variable, creating histograms by experimental groups, and
		creating a scatter plot and calculating the correlation between
		two variables.
