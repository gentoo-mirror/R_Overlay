		Displays Percentage and Absolute Changes // Displays percentage
		changes by height and absolute changes by area for up to three
		nested or non-nested levels. The plots visualise changes in
		indices and markets, showing how the changes for sectors or for
		individual components contribute to the overall change. Data
		can be classified by up to three levels of grouping variables
		in a layered, hierarchical plot. Each level can be ordered in
		several ways including by baseline, by percentage change, and
		by absolute change. The vignettes give examples.
