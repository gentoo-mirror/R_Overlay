		The Artificial Neural Networks Algorithm Leabra // The algorithm
		Leabra (local error driven and associative biologically
		realistic algorithm) allows for the construction of artificial
		neural networks that are biologically realistic and balance
		supervised and unsupervised learning within a single framework.
		This package is based on the 'MATLAB' version by Sergio
		Verduzco-Flores, which in turn was based on the description of
		the algorithm by Randall O'Reilly (1996) ftp://grey.colorado.ed
		u/pub/oreilly/thesis/oreilly_thesis.all.pdf. For more general
		(not 'R' specific) information on the algorithm Leabra see
		https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Leabra.
