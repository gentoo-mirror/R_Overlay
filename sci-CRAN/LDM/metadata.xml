		Testing Hypotheses About the Microbiome using the Linear
		Decomposition Model // A single analysis path that includes
		distance-based ordination, global tests of any effect of the
		microbiome, and tests of the effects of individual taxa with
		false-discovery-rate (FDR) control. It accommodates both
		continuous and discrete covariates as well as interaction terms
		to be tested either singly or in combination, allows for
		adjustment of confounding covariates, and uses permutation-
		based p-values that can control for sample correlations. It can
		be applied to transformed data, and an omnibus test can combine
		results from analyses conducted on different transformation
		scales. It can also be used for testing presence-absence
		associations based on infinite number of rarefaction
		replicates, testing mediation effects of the microbiome,
		analyzing censored time-to-event outcomes, and for
		compositional analysis by fitting linear models to centered-
		log-ratio taxa count data.
