		Sparse Reluctant Interaction Modeling // An implementation of a
		computationally efficient method to fit large-scale interaction
		models based on the reluctant interaction selection principle.
		The method and its properties are described in greater depth in
		Yu, G., Bien, J., and Tibshirani, R.J. (2019) "Reluctant
		interaction modeling", which is available at arXiv:1907.08414.
