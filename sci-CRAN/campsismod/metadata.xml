		Generic Implementation of a PK/PD Model // A generic, easy-to-use
		and expandable implementation of a pharmacokinetic (PK) /
		pharmacodynamic (PD) model based on the S4 class system. This
		package allows the user to read/write a pharmacometric model
		from/to files and adapt it further on the fly in the R
		environment. For this purpose, this package provides an
		intuitive API to add, modify or delete equations, ordinary
		differential equations (ODE's), model parameters or compartment
		properties (like infusion duration or rate, bioavailability and
		initial values). Finally, this package also provides a useful
		export of the model for use with simulation packages 'RxODE'
		and 'mrgsolve'. This package is designed and intended to be
		used with package 'campsis', a PK/PD simulation platform built
		on top of 'RxODE' and 'mrgsolve'.
