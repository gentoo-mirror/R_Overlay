		Robust Time Series Filters // Implementations for several robust
		procedures that allow for (online) extraction of the signal of
		univariate or multivariate time series by applying robust
		regression techniques to a moving time window are provided.
		Included are univariate filtering procedures based on repeated-
		median regression as well as hybrid and trimmed filters derived
		from it; see Schettlinger et al. (2006)
		doi:10.1515/BMT.2006.010. The adaptive online repeated median
		by Schettlinger et al. (2010) doi:10.1002/acs.1105 and the
		slope comparing adaptive repeated median by Borowski and Fried
		(2013) doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9391-7 choose the width of the
		moving time window adaptively. Multivariate versions are also
		provided; see Borowski et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1080/03610910802514972 for a multivariate online
		adaptive repeated median and Borowski (2012)
		doi:10.17877/DE290R-14393 for a multivariate slope comparing
		adaptive repeated median. Furthermore, a repeated-median based
		filter with automatic outlier replacement and shift detection
		is provided; see Fried (2004) doi:10.1080/10485250410001656444.
