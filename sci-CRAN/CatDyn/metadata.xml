		Fishery Stock Assessment by Catch Dynamics Models // Based on
		fishery Catch Dynamics instead of fish Population Dynamics
		(hence CatDyn) and using high-frequency or medium-frequency
		catch in biomass or numbers, fishing nominal effort, and mean
		fish body weight by time step, from one or two fishing fleets,
		estimate stock abundance, natural mortality rate, and fishing
		operational parameters. It includes methods for data
		organization, plotting standard exploratory and analytical
		plots, predictions, for 100 types of models of increasing
		complexity, and 72 likelihood models for the data.
