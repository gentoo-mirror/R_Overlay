		Chauvenet-Type Boxplot // Provides a modified boxplot with a new
		fence coefficient determined by Lin et al. (2025). The
		traditional fence coefficient k=1.5 in Tukey's boxplot is
		replaced by a coefficient based on Chauvenet's criterion, as
		described in their formula (9). The new boxplot can be
		implemented in 'base R' with function chau_boxplot(), and in
		'ggplot2' with function geom_chau_boxplot().
