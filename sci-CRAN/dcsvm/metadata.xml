		Density Convoluted Support Vector Machines // Implements an
		efficient algorithm for solving sparse-penalized support vector
		machines with kernel density convolution. This package is
		designed for high-dimensional classification tasks, supporting
		lasso (L1) and elastic-net penalties for sparse feature
		selection and providing options for tuning kernel bandwidth and
		penalty weights. The 'dcsvm' is applicable to fields such as
		bioinformatics, image analysis, and text classification, where
		high-dimensional data commonly arise. Learn more about the
		methodology and algorithm at Wang, Zhou, Gu, and Zou (2023)
