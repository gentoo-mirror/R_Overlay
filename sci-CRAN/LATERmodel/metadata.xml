		Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate for Reaction Times
		// Implements the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic
		Rate (LATER) model, which predicts distributions of reaction
		times and summarises them with as little as two free
		parameters. Allows for easy visualisation and comparison of
		datasets, along with fitting of datasets using the LATER model.
