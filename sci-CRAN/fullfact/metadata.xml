		Full Factorial Breeding Analysis // We facilitate the analysis of
		full factorial mating designs with mixed-effects models. The
		observed data functions extract the variance explained by
		random and fixed effects and provide their significance. We
		then calculate the additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and
		maternal variance components explaining the phenotype. In
		particular, we integrate nonnormal error structures for
		estimating these components for nonnormal data types. The
		resampled data functions are used to produce bootstrap
		confidence intervals, which can then be plotted using a simple
		function. This package will facilitate the analyses of full
		factorial mating designs in R, especially for the analysis of
		binary, proportion, and/or count data types and for the ability
		to incorporate additional random and fixed effects and power
		analyses. The paper associated with the package including
		worked examples is: Houde ALS, Pitcher TE (2016)
