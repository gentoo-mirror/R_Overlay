		Identification of Core Microbiome // The Core Microbiome refers
		to the group of microorganisms that are consistently present in
		a particular environment, habitat, or host species. These
		microorganisms play a crucial role in the functioning and
		stability of that ecosystem. Identifying these microorganisms
		can contribute to the emerging field of personalized medicine.
		The 'CoreMicrobiomeR' is designed to facilitate the
		identification, statistical testing, and visualization of this
		group of microorganisms.This package offers three key functions
		to analyze and visualize microbial community data. This package
		has been developed based on the research papers published by
		Pereira et al.(2018) doi:10.1186/s12864-018-4637-6 and Beule L,
		Karlovsky P. (2020) doi:10.7717/peerj.9593.
