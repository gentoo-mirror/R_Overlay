		Mini Games from Adventures of Beta and Bit // Three games:
		proton, frequon and regression. Each one is a console-based
		data-crunching game for younger and older data scientists. Act
		as a data-hacker and find Slawomir Pietraszko's credentials to
		the Proton server. In proton you have to solve four data-based
		puzzles to find the login and password. There are many ways to
		solve these puzzles. You may use loops, data filtering,
		ordering, aggregation or other tools. Only basics knowledge of
		R is required to play the game, yet the more functions you
		know, the more approaches you can try. In frequon you will help
		to perform statistical cryptanalytic attack on a corpus of
		ciphered messages. This time seven sub-tasks are pushing the
		bar much higher. Do you accept the challenge? In regression you
		will test your modeling skills in a series of eight sub-tasks.
		Try only if ANOVA is your close friend. It's a part of Beta and
		Bit project. You will find more about the Beta and Bit project
		at https://betabit.wiki.
