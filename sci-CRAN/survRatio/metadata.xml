		Estimating, Comparing and Visualising Time to Event Data // The
		'survRatio', provides numerical and graphical summaries for
		time to event data. In this release functions are provided to
		estimate and compare estimated survivor functions, the ratio of
		survivor functions and the difference of survivor functions in
		independent and paired time to event problems. Time intervals
		where the survival prospects may differ are identified using
		pointwise confidence bands. See "Survival ratio plots with
		permutation envelopes in survival data problems" by Newell J,
		et al. (2006) doi:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2005.03.005.
