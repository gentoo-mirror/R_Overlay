		Comparing Single Cases to Small Samples // When comparing single
		cases to control populations and no parameters are known
		researchers and clinicians must estimate these with a control
		sample. This is often done when testing a case's abnormality on
		some variable or testing abnormality of the discrepancy between
		two variables. Appropriate frequentist and Bayesian methods for
		doing this are here implemented, including tests allowing for
		the inclusion of covariates. These have been developed first
		and foremost by John Crawford and Paul Garthwaite, e.g. in
		Crawford and Howell (1998) doi:10.1076/clin.12.4.482.7241,
		Crawford and Garthwaite (2005) doi:10.1037/0894-4105.19.3.318,
		Crawford and Garthwaite (2007) doi:10.1080/02643290701290146
		and Crawford, Garthwaite and Ryan (2011)
		doi:10.1016/j.cortex.2011.02.017. The package is also equipped
		with power calculators for each method.
