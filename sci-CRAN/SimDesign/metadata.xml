		Structure for Organizing Monte Carlo Simulation Designs //
		Provides tools to help safely and efficiently organize Monte
		Carlo simulations in R. The package controls the structure and
		back-end of Monte Carlo simulations by utilizing a general
		generate-analyse-summarise strategy. The functions provided
		control common simulation issues such as re-simulating non-
		convergent results, support parallel back-end and MPI
		distributed computations, save and restore temporary files,
		aggregate results across independent nodes, and provide native
		support for debugging. For a pedagogical introduction to the
		package refer to Sigal and Chalmers (2016)
		doi:10.1080/10691898.2016.1246953, and for an in-depth overview
		of the package and its design philosophy see Chalmers and
		Adkins (2020) doi:10.20982/tqmp.16.4.p248.
