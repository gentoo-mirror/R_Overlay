		Structure for Organizing Monte Carlo Simulation Designs //
		Provides tools to safely and efficiently organize and execute
		Monte Carlo simulation experiments in R. The package controls
		the structure and back-end of Monte Carlo simulation
		experiments by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise workflow.
		The workflow safeguards against common simulation coding
		issues, such as automatically re-simulating non-convergent
		results, prevents inadvertently overwriting simulation files,
		catches error and warning messages during execution, implicitly
		supports parallel processing with high-quality random number
		generation, and provides tools for managing high-performance
		computing (HPC) array jobs submitted to schedulers such as
		SLURM. For a pedagogical introduction to the package see Sigal
		and Chalmers (2016) doi:10.1080/10691898.2016.1246953. For a
		more in-depth overview of the package and its design philosophy
		see Chalmers and Adkins (2020) doi:10.20982/tqmp.16.4.p248.
