		Shiny Apps to Support Capacity Building on Harvest Control Rules
		// Three Shiny apps are provided that introduce Harvest Control
		Rules (HCR) for fisheries management. 'Introduction to HCRs'
		provides a simple overview to how HCRs work. Users are able to
		select their own HCR and step through its performance, year by
		year. Biological variability and estimation uncertainty are
		introduced. 'Measuring performance' builds on the previous app
		and introduces the idea of using performance indicators to
		measure HCR performance. 'Comparing performance' allows
		multiple HCRs to be created and tested, and their performance
		compared so that the preferred HCR can be selected.
