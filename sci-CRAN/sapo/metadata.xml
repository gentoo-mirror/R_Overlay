		Spatial Association of Different Types of Polygon // In ecology,
		spatial data is often represented using polygons. These
		polygons can represent a variety of spatial entities, such as
		ecological patches, animal home ranges, or gaps in the forest
		canopy.  Researchers often need to determine if two spatial
		processes, represented by these polygons, are independent of
		each other. For instance, they might want to test if the home
		range of a particular animal species is influenced by the
		presence of a certain type of vegetation.  To address this,
		Godoy et al. (2022) (doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2022.100695)
		developed conditional Monte Carlo tests. These tests are
		designed to assess spatial independence while taking into
		account the shape and size of the polygons.
