		Raster-Based Spatial Stratification Algorithms // Algorithms for
		the spatial stratification of landscapes, sampling and modeling
		of spatially-varying phenomena. These algorithms offer a simple
		framework for the stratification of geographic space based on
		raster layers representing landscape factors and/or factor
		scales. The stratification process follows a hierarchical
		approach, which is based on first level units (i.e.,
		classification units) and second-level units (i.e.,
		stratification units). Nonparametric techniques allow to
		measure the correspondence between the geographic space and the
		landscape configuration represented by the units. These
		correspondence metrics are useful to define sampling schemes
		and to model the spatial variability of environmental
		phenomena. The theoretical background of the algorithms and
		code examples are presented in Fuentes et al. (2022).
