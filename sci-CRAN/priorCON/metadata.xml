		Graph Community Detection Methods into Systematic Conservation
		Planning // An innovative tool-set that incorporates graph
		community detection methods into systematic conservation
		planning. It is designed to enhance spatial prioritization by
		focusing on the protection of areas with high ecological
		connectivity. Unlike traditional approaches that prioritize
		individual planning units, 'priorCON' focuses on clusters of
		features that exhibit strong ecological linkages. The
		'priorCON' package is built upon the 'prioritizr' package
		doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.prioritizr, using commercial and
		open-source exact algorithm solvers that ensure optimal
		solutions to prioritization problems.
