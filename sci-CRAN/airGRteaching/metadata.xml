		Teaching Hydrological Modelling with the GR Rainfall-Runoff
		Models ('Shiny' Interface Included) // Add-on package to the
		'airGR' package that simplifies its use and is aimed at being
		used for teaching hydrology. The package provides 1) three
		functions that allow to complete very simply a hydrological
		modelling exercise 2) plotting functions to help students to
		explore observed data and to interpret the results of
		calibration and simulation of the GR ('Gnie rural') models 3) a
		'Shiny' graphical interface that allows for displaying the
		impact of model parameters on hydrographs and models internal
		variables.
