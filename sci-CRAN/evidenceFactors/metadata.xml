		Reporting Tools for Sensitivity Analysis of Evidence Factors in
		Observational Studies // Provides tools for integrated
		sensitivity analysis of evidence factors in observational
		studies. When an observational study allows for multiple
		independent or nearly independent inferences which, if
		vulnerable, are vulnerable to different biases, we have
		multiple evidence factors.  This package provides methods that
		respect type I error rate control. Examples are provided of
		integrated evidence factors analysis in a longitudinal study
		with continuous outcome and in a case-control study. Karmakar,
		B., French, B., and Small, D. S.
