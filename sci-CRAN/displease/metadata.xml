		Numeric and Color Sequences with Non-Linear Interpolation // When
		visualising changes between two values over time, a strict
		linear interpolation can look jarring and unnatural.  By
		applying a non-linear easing to the transition, the motion
		between values can appear smoother and more natural.  This
		package includes functions for applying such non-linear easings
		to colors and numeric values, and is useful where smooth
		animated movement and transitions are desired.
