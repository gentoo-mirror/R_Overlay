		Geographically Optimal Similarity // Understanding spatial
		association is essential for spatial statistical inference,
		including factor exploration and spatial prediction.
		Geographically optimal similarity (GOS) model is an effective
		method for spatial prediction, as described in Yongze Song
		(2022) doi:10.1007/s11004-022-10036-8. GOS was developed based
		on the geographical similarity principle, as described in Axing
		Zhu (2018) doi:10.1080/19475683.2018.1534890. GOS has
		advantages in more accurate spatial prediction using fewer
		samples and critically reduced prediction uncertainty.
