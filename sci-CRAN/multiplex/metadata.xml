		Algebraic Tools for the Analysis of Multiple Social Networks //
		Algebraic procedures for the analysis of multiple social
		networks are delivered with this package as described in Ostoic
		(2020) DOI:10.18637/jss.v092.i11. Among other things, it makes
		it possible to create and manipulate multiplex, multimode, and
		multilevel network data with different formats. There are
		effective ways available to treat multiple networks with
		routines that combine algebraic systems like the partially
		ordered semigroup or the semiring structure with the relational
		bundles occurring in different types of multivariate network
		data sets. It also provides an algebraic approach for
		affiliation networks through Galois derivations between
		families of the pairs of subsets in the two domains.
