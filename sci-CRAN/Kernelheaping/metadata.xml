		Kernel Density Estimation for Heaped and Rounded Data // In self-
		reported or anonymised data the user often encounters heaped
		data, i.e. data which are rounded (to a possibly different
		degree of coarseness). While this is mostly a minor problem in
		parametric density estimation the bias can be very large for
		non-parametric methods such as kernel density estimation. This
		package implements a partly Bayesian algorithm treating the
		true unknown values as additional parameters and estimates the
		rounding parameters to give a corrected kernel density
		estimate. It supports various standard bandwidth selection
		methods. Varying rounding probabilities (depending on the true
		value) and asymmetric rounding is estimable as well: Gross, M.
		and Rendtel, U. (2016) (doi:10.1093/jssam/smw011).
		Additionally, bivariate non-parametric density estimation for
		rounded data, Gross, M. et al. (2016) (doi:10.1111/rssa.12179),
		as well as data aggregated on areas is supported.
