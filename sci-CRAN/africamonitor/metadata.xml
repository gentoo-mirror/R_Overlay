		Africa Macroeconomic Monitor Database API // An R API providing
		access to a relational database with macroeconomic data for
		Africa. The database contains 700 macroeconomic time series
		from mostly international sources, grouped into 50
		macroeconomic and development-related topics. Series are
		carefully selected on the basis of data coverage for Africa,
		frequency, and relevance to the macro-development context. The
		project is part of the 'Kiel Institute Africa Initiative'
		https://www.ifw-kiel.de/institute/initiatives/kiel-institute-
		africa-initiative/, which, amongst other things, aims to
		develop a parsimonious database with highly relevant indicators
		to monitor macroeconomic developments in Africa, accessible
		through a fast API and a web-based platform at
		https://africamonitor.ifw-kiel.de/. The database is maintained
		at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy https://www.ifw-
		kiel.de/.
