		Nonparametric Preprocessing for Parametric Causal Inference //
		Selects matched samples of the original treated and control
		groups with similar covariate distributions -- can be used to
		match exactly on covariates, to match on propensity scores, or
		perform a variety of other matching procedures.  The package
		also implements a series of recommendations offered in Ho,
		Imai, King, and Stuart (2007) DOI:10.1093/pan/mpl013. (The
		'gurobi' package, which is not on CRAN, is optional and comes
		with an installation of the Gurobi Optimizer, available at
		https://www.gurobi.com. The 'optmatch' package may also not be
		on CRAN; see the 'MatchIt' documentation for instructions on
		installing it.)
