		Breaks for Additive Season and Trend // Decomposition of time
		series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with
		methods for detecting and characterizing abrupt changes within
		the trend and seasonal components. 'BFAST' can be used to
		analyze different types of satellite image time series and can
		be applied to other disciplines dealing with seasonal or non-
		seasonal time series, such as hydrology, climatology, and
		econometrics. The algorithm can be extended to label detected
		changes with information on the parameters of the fitted
		piecewise linear models. 'BFAST' monitoring functionality is
		described in Verbesselt et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1016/j.rse.2009.08.014. 'BFAST monitor' provides
		functionality to detect disturbance in near real-time based on
		'BFAST'- type models, and is described in Verbesselt et al.
		(2012) doi:10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.022. 'BFAST Lite' approach is
		a flexible approach that handles missing data without
		interpolation, and will be described in an upcoming paper.
		Furthermore, different models can now be used to fit the time
		series data and detect structural changes (breaks).
