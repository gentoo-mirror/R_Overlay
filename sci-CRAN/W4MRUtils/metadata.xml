		Utils List for W4M - Workflow for Metabolomics // Provides a set
		of utility function to prevent the spread of utilities script
		in W4M (Workflow4Metabolomics) scripts, and centralize them in
		a single package. Some are meant to be replaced by real
		packages in a near future, like the parse_args() function: it
		is here only to prepare the ground for more global changes in
		W4M scripts and tools.
