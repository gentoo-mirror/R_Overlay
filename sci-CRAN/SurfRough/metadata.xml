		Calculate Surface/Image Texture Indexes // Methods for the
		computation of surface/image texture indices using a
		geostatistical based approach (Trevisani et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108838). It provides various
		functions for the computation of surface texture indices (e.g.,
		omnidirectional roughness and roughness anisotropy), including
		the ones based on the robust MAD estimator. The kernels
		included in the software permit also to calculate the
		surface/image texture indices directly from the input surface
		(i.e., without de-trending) using increments of order 2. It
		also provides the new radial roughness index (RRI),
		representing the improvement of the popular topographic
		roughness index (TRI). The framework can be easily extended
		with ad-hoc surface/image texture indices.
