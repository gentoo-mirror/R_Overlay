		Non-Gaussian State-Space with Exact Marginal Likelihood // Due to
		a large quantity of non-Gaussian time series and reliability
		data, the R-package non-Gaussian state-space with exact
		marginal likelihood is useful for modeling and forecasting non-
		Gaussian time series and reliability data via non-Gaussian
		state-space models with the exact marginal likelihood easily,
		see Gamerman, Santos and Franco (2013) doi:10.1111/jtsa.12039
		and Santos, Gamerman and Franco (2017)
		doi:10.1109/TR.2017.2670142. The package gives codes for
		formulating and specifying the non-Gaussian state-space models
		in the R language. Inferences for the parameters of the model
		can be made under the classical and Bayesian. Furthermore,
		prediction, filtering, and smoothing procedures can be used to
		perform inferences for the latent parameters. Applications
		include, e.g., count, volatility, piecewise exponential, and
		software reliability data.
