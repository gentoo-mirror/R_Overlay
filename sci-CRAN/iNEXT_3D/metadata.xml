		Interpolation and Extrapolation for Three Dimensions of
		Biodiversity // Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept covering
		different levels of organization from genes to ecosystems.
		'iNEXT.3D' extends 'iNEXT' to include three dimensions (3D) of
		biodiversity, i.e., taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic
		diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD). This package
		provides functions to compute standardized 3D diversity
		estimates with a common sample size or sample coverage. A
		unified framework based on Hill numbers and their
		generalizations (Hill-Chao numbers) are used to quantify 3D.
		All 3D estimates are in the same units of species/lineage
		equivalents and can be meaningfully compared. The package
		features size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation
		sampling curves to facilitate rigorous comparison of 3D
		diversity across individual assemblages. Asymptotic 3D
		diversity estimates are also provided. See Chao et al. (2021)
