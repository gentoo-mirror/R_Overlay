		Advanced Tables for Markdown/HTML // Tables with state-of-the-art
		layout elements such as row spanners, column spanners, table
		spanners, zebra striping, and more. While allowing advanced
		layout, the underlying css-structure is simple in order to
		maximize compatibility with word processors such as 'MS Word'
		or 'LibreOffice'. The package also contains a few text
		formatting functions that help outputting text compatible with
		HTML/LaTeX.
