		Recovering a Basic Space from Issue Scales // Provides functions
		to estimate latent dimensions of choice and judgment using
		Aldrich-McKelvey and Blackbox scaling methods, as described in
		Poole et al. (2016, doi:10.18637/jss.v069.i07). These
		techniques allow researchers (particularly those analyzing
		political attitudes, public opinion, and legislative behavior)
		to recover spatial estimates of political actors' ideal points
		and stimuli from issue scale data, accounting for perceptual
		bias, multidimensional spaces, and missing data. The package
		uses singular value decomposition and alternating least squares
		(ALS) procedures to scale self-placement and perceptual data
		into a common latent space for the analysis of ideological or
		evaluative dimensions. Functionality also include tools for
		assessing model fit, handling complex survey data structures,
		and reproducing simulated datasets for methodological
		validation.
