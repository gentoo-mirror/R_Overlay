		Calculate Expertise Indices // Institutional performance
		assessment remains a key challenge to a multitude of
		stakeholders. Existing indicators such as h-type indicators,
		g-type indicators, and many others do not reflect expertise of
		institutions that defines their research portfolio. The package
		offers functionality to compute and visualise two novel
		indices: the x-index and the xd-index. The x-index evaluates an
		institution's scholarly expertise within a specific discipline
		or field, while the xd-index provides a broader assessment of
		overall scholarly expertise considering an institution's
		publication pattern and strengths across coarse thematic areas.
		These indices offer a nuanced understanding of institutional
		research capabilities, aiding stakeholders in research
		management and resource allocation decisions. Lathabai, H.H.,

		provides the h, g, x, and xd indices for use with standard
		format of Web of Science (WoS) scrapped datasets.
