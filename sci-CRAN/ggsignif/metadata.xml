		Significance Bars for 'ggplot2' // Enrich your ggplots with
		group-wise comparisons. This package provides an easy way to
		indicate if two groups are significantly different. Commonly
		this is shown by a bar on top connecting the groups of interest
		which itself is annotated with the level of significance (NS,
		*, **, ***). The package provides a single layer
		(geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison and the
		test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and adds the
		annotation to the plot.
