		Detect Change Points in Means of High Dimensional Data //
		Objective: Implement new methods for detecting change points in
		high-dimensional time series data. These new methods can be
		applied to non-Gaussian data, account for spatial and temporal
		dependence, and detect a wide variety of change-point
		configurations, including changes near the boundary and changes
		in close proximity. Additionally, this package helps address
		the small n, large p problem, which occurs in many research
		contexts. This problem arises when a dataset contains changes
		that are visually evident but do not rise to the level of
		statistical significance due to the small number of
		observations and large number of parameters. The problem is
		overcome by treating the dimensions as a whole and scaling the
		test statistics only by its standard deviation, rather than
		scaling each dimension individually. Due to the computational
		complexity of the functions, the package runs best on datasets
		with a relatively large number of attributes but no more than a
		few hundred observations.
