		Matrix Completion, Imputation, and Inpainting Methods // Filling
		in the missing entries of a partially observed data is one of
		fundamental problems in various disciplines of mathematical
		science. For many cases, data at our interests have canonical
		form of matrix in that the problem is posed upon a matrix with
		missing values to fill in the entries under preset assumptions
		and models. We provide a collection of methods from multiple
		disciplines under Matrix Completion, Imputation, and
		Inpainting. See Davenport and Romberg (2016)
		doi:10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2539100 for an overview of the topic.
