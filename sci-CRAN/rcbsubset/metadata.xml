		Optimal Subset Matching with Refined Covariate Balance // Tools
		for optimal subset matching of treated units and control units
		in observational studies, with support for refined covariate
		balance constraints, (including fine and near-fine balance as
		special cases). A close relative is the 'rcbalance' package.
		See Pimentel, et al.(2015) doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879 and
		Pimentel and Kelz (2020) doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1720693. The
		optmatch package, which is useful for running many of the
		provided functions, may be downloaded from Github at
		https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch if not available
		on CRAN.
