		Optimal Subset Matching with Refined Covariate Balance // Tools
		for optimal subset matching of treated units and control units
		in observational studies, with support for refined covariate
		balance constraints, (including fine and near-fine balance as
		special cases). A close relative is the 'rcbalance' package.
		See Pimentel, et al.(2015) doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879 and
		Pimentel and Kelz (2020) doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1720693. The
		rrelaxiv package, which provides an alternative solver for the
		underlying network flow problems, carries an academic license
		and is not available on CRAN, but may be downloaded from Github
		at https://github.com/josherrickson/rrelaxiv/.
