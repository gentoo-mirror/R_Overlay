		The n-vector Approach to Geographical Position Calculations using
		an Ellipsoidal Model of Earth // The n-vector framework uses
		the normal vector to the Earth ellipsoid (called n-vector) as a
		non-singular position representation that turns out to be very
		convenient for practical position calculations.  The n-vector
		is simple to use and gives exact answers for all global
		positions, and all distances, for both ellipsoidal and
		spherical Earth models.  This package is a translation of the
		'Matlab' library from FFI, the Norwegian Defence Research
		Establishment, as described in Gade (2010)
