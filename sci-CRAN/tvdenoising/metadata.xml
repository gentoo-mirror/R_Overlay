		Univariate Total Variation Denoising // Total variation denoising
		can be used to approximate a given sequence of noisy
		observations by a piecewise constant sequence, with adaptively-
		chosen break points. An efficient linear-time algorithm for
		total variation denoising is provided here, based on Johnson
		(2013) doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.681238.
