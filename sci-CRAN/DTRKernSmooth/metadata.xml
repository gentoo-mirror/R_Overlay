		Estimate and Make Inference About Optimal Treatment Regimes via
		Smoothed Methods // Methods to estimate the optimal treatment
		regime among all linear regimes via smoothed estimation
		methods, and construct element-wise confidence intervals for
		the optimal linear treatment regime vector, as well as the
		confidence interval for the optimal value via wild bootstrap
		procedures, if the population follows treatments recommended by
		the optimal linear regime. See more details in: Wu, Y. and
		Wang, L. (2021), "Resampling-based Confidence Intervals for
		Model-free Robust Inference on Optimal Treatment Regimes",
		Biometrics, 77: 465 476, doi:10.1111/biom.13337.
