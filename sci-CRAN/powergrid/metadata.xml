		Power Analysis Across a Grid of Assumptions // Evaluate a
		function across a grid of parameters. The function may be
		evaluated once, or many times for simulation. Parallel
		computing is facilitated. Utilities aim at performing analyses
		of power and sample size, allowing for easy search of minimum n
		(or min/max of any other parameter) to achieve a desired
		minimal level of power (or maximum of any other objective).
		Plotting functions are included that present the dependency of
		n and power in relation to further assumptions.
