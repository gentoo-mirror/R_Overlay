		Opinionated Approach for Digitizing Semi-Structured Qualitative
		GIS Data // Provides a set of functions for taking qualitative
		GIS data, hand drawn on a map, and converting it to a simple
		features object. These tools are focused on data that are drawn
		on a map that contains some type of polygon features. For each
		area identified on the map, the id numbers of these polygons
		can be entered as vectors and transformed using qualmap.
