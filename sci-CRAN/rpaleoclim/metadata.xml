		Download Paleoclimate Data from 'PaleoClim' // 'PaleoClim'
		http://www.paleoclim.org (Brown et al. 2019,
		doi:10.1038/sdata.2018.254) is a set of free, high resolution
		paleoclimate surfaces covering the whole globe. It includes
		data on surface temperature, precipitation and the standard
		bioclimatic variables commonly used in ecological modelling,
		derived from the 'HadCM3' general circulation model and
		downscaled to a spatial resolution of up to 2.5 minutes.
		Simulations are available for key time periods from the Late
		Holocene to mid-Pliocene. Data on current and Last Glacial
		Maximum climate is derived from 'CHELSA'  (Karger et al. 2017,
		doi:10.1038/sdata.2017.122) and reprocessed by 'PaleoClim' to
		match their format; it is available at up to 30 seconds
		resolution. This package provides a simple interface for
		downloading 'PaleoClim' data in R, with support for caching and
		filtering retrieved data by period, resolution, and geographic
		extent.
