		Estimator Augmentation and Simulation-Based Inference //
		Estimator augmentation methods for statistical inference on
		high-dimensional data, as described in Zhou, Q. (2014)
		arXiv:1401.4425v2 and Zhou, Q. and Min, S. (2017)
		doi:10.1214/17-EJS1309. It provides several simulation-based
		inference methods: (a) Gaussian and wild multiplier bootstrap
		for lasso, group lasso, scaled lasso, scaled group lasso and
		their de-biased estimators, (b) importance sampler for
		approximating p-values in these methods, (c) Markov chain Monte
		Carlo lasso sampler with applications in post-selection
		inference.
