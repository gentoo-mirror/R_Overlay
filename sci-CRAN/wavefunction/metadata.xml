		Wave Function Representation of Real Distributions // Real
		probability distributions can be represented as the square of
		an orthogonal sum in the Hermite basis. This representation is
		formally similar to the representation of quantum mechanical
		states as wave functions, whose squared modulus is a
		probability density. This is described in more detail in "Wave
		function representation of probability distributions," by
		Madeleine B. Thompson arXiv:1712.07764. This package provides a
		reference implementation of the technique.
