		Generate, Visualise, and Evaluate Fast-and-Frugal Decision Trees
		// Create, visualize, and test fast-and-frugal decision trees
		(FFTs) using methods described in Phillips, Neth, Woike
		Gaissmaier. (2017). FFTs are very simple decision trees for
		binary classification problems. FFTs can be preferable to more
		complex algorithms because they are easy to communicate,
		require very little information, and are robust against
		overfitting.
