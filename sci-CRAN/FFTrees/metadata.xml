		Generate, Visualise, and Evaluate Fast-and-Frugal Decision Trees
		// Create, visualize, and test fast-and-frugal decision trees
		(FFTs) using the algorithms and methods described in Phillips,
		Neth, Woike  Gaissmaier (2017). FFTs are simple and transparent
		decision trees for solving binary classification problems. FFTs
		can be preferable to more complex algorithms because they
		require very little information, are easy to communicate, and
		are robust against overfitting.
