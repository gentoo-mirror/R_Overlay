		Generate, Visualise, and Compare Fast and Frugal Decision Trees
		// Create, visualise, and test fast and frugal decision trees
		(FFTrees). FFTrees are very simple decision trees for
		classifying cases (i.e.; breast cancer patients) into one of
		two classes (e.g.; no cancer vs. true cancer) based on a small
		number of cues (e.g.; test results). FFTrees can be preferable
		to more complex algorithms because they are easy to
		communicate, require very little information, and are robust
		against overfitting.
