		Generate, Visualise, and Evaluate Fast-and-Frugal Decision Trees
		// Create, visualize, and test fast-and-frugal decision trees
		(FFTs) using the algorithms and methods described by Phillips,
		Neth, Woike  Gaissmaier (2017), doi:10.1017/S1930297500006239.
		FFTs are simple and transparent decision trees for solving
		binary classification problems. FFTs can be preferable to more
		complex algorithms because they require very little
		information, are easy to understand and communicate, and are
		robust against overfitting.
