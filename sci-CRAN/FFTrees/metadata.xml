		Generate, Visualise, and Evaluate Fast-and-Frugal Decision Trees
		// Create, visualize, and test fast-and-frugal decision trees
		(FFTs). FFTs are very simple decision trees for classifying
		cases (i.e.; breast cancer patients) into one of two classes
		(e.g.; no cancer vs. true cancer) based on a small number of
		cues (e.g.; test results). FFTs can be preferable to more
		complex algorithms because they are easy to communicate,
		require very little information, and are robust against
		overfitting.
