		Penalized Splines Mixed-Effects Models // Fit penalized splines
		mixed-effects models (a special case of additive models) for
		large longitudinal datasets. The package includes a psme()
		function that (1) relies on package 'mgcv' for constructing
		population and subject smooth functions as penalized splines,
		(2) transforms the constructed additive model to a linear
		mixed-effects model, (3) exploits package 'lme4' for model
		estimation and (4) backtransforms the estimated linear mixed-
		effects model to the additive model for interpretation and
		visualization. See Pedersen et al. (2019)
		doi:10.7717/peerj.6876 and Bates et al. (2015)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v067.i01 for an introduction. Unlike the
		gamm() function in 'mgcv', the psme() function is fast and
		memory-efficient, able to handle datasets with millions of
		observations.
