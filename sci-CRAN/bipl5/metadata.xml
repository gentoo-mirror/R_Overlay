		Construct Reactive Calibrated Axes Biplots // A modern view on
		the principal component analysis biplot with calibrated axes.
		Create principal component analysis biplots rendered in HTML
		with significant reactivity embedded within the plot.
		Furthermore, the traditional biplot view is enhanced by
		translated axes with inter-class kernel densities superimposed.
		For more information on biplots, see Gower, J.C., Lubbe, S. and
		le Roux, N.J. (2011, ISBN: 978-0-470-01255-0).
