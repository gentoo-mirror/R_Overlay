		Spatial Transfer of Statistics among Spanish Census Sections //
		Transfers/imputes statistics among Spanish spatial polygons
		(census sections or postal code areas) from different moments
		in time (2001-2022) without need of spatial files, just linking
		statistics to the ID codes of the spatial units. The data
		available in the census sections of a partition/division
		(cartography) into force in a moment of time is transferred to
		the census sections of another partition/division employing the
		geometric approach (also known as areal weighting or polygon
		overlay). References: Goerlich (2022) doi:10.12842/WPIVIE_0322.
