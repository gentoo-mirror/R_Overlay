		Group Subset Selection // Provides tools for sparse regression
		modelling with grouped predictors using the group subset
		selection penalty. Uses coordinate descent and local search
		algorithms to rapidly deliver near optimal estimates. The group
		subset penalty can be combined with a group lasso or ridge
		penalty for added shrinkage. Linear and logistic regression are
		supported, as are overlapping groups.
