		Fast, Exact Bootstrap Principal Component Analysis for High
		Dimensional Data // Implements fast, exact bootstrap Principal
		Component Analysis and Singular Value Decompositions for high
		dimensional data, as described in
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1062383 (see also arXiv:1405.0922 ).
		For data matrices that are too large to operate on in memory,
		users can input objects with class 'ff' (see the 'ff' package),
		where the actual data is stored on disk. In response, this
		package will implement a block matrix algebra procedure for
		calculating the principal components (PCs) and bootstrap PCs.
		Depending on options set by the user, the 'parallel' package
		can be used to parallelize the calculation of the bootstrap
		PCs.
