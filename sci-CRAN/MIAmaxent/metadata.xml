		A Modular, Integrated Approach to Maximum Entropy Distribution
		Modeling // Tools for training, selecting, and evaluating
		maximum entropy (and standard logistic regression) distribution
		models. This package provides tools for user-controlled
		transformation of explanatory variables, selection of variables
		by nested model comparison, and flexible model evaluation and
		projection. It follows principles based on the maximum-
		likelihood interpretation of maximum entropy modeling, and uses
		infinitely- weighted logistic regression for model fitting. The
		package is described in Vollering et al. (2019;
		doi:10.1002/ece3.5654).
