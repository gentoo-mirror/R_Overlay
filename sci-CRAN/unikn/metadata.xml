		Graphical Elements of the University of Konstanz's Corporate
		Design // Define and use graphical elements of corporate design
		manuals in R. The 'unikn' package provides color functions (by
		defining dedicated colors and color palettes, and commands for
		changing, viewing, and using them) and styled text elements
		(e.g., for marking, underlining, or plotting colored titles).
		The pre-defined range of colors and text functions is based on
		the corporate design of the University of Konstanz https://www
		.uni-konstanz.de/, but can be adapted and extended for other
		institutions and purposes.
