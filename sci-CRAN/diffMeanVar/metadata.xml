		Detecting Gene Probes with Different Means or Variances Between
		Two Groups // A collection of functions to detect gene probes
		with different means or variances between two groups in
		(epi)-genomic data analysis, including classical F test and
		Levene's test for equal variance, likelihood ratio test for
		equal mean and equal variance, the wrappers for functions in R
		Bioconductor package 'missMethyl' (Phipson and Oshlack (2014)
		doi:10.1186/s13059-014-0465-4), the implementation of the
		methods proposed by Ahn and Wang (2013)
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621641/, and the
		improved Ahn and Wang's methods that we proposed recently (Qiu
		and Li et al. (2017) http://oprscience.com/wp-
		content/uploads/2016/07/new-score-tests-for-equality-of-
		variances-in-the-application-of-dna-methylation-data-
		analysis.pdf).
