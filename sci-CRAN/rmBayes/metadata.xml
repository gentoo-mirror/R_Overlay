		Performing Bayesian Inference for Repeated-Measures Designs // A
		Bayesian credible interval is interpreted with respect to
		posterior probability, and this interpretation is far more
		intuitive than that of a frequentist confidence interval.
		However, standard highest-density intervals can be wide due to
		between-subjects variability and tends to hide within-subjects
		effects, rendering its relationship with the Bayes factor less
		clear in within-subjects (repeated-measures) designs. This
		urgent issue can be addressed by using within-subjects
		intervals in within-subjects designs, which integrate four
		methods including the Loftus-Masson (1994)
