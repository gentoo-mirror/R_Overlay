		Performing Bayesian Inference for Repeated-Measures Designs // A
		Bayesian credible interval is interpreted with respect to
		posterior probability, and this interpretation is far more
		intuitive than that of a frequentist confidence interval.
		However, standard highest-density intervals can be wide due to
		between-subjects variability and tends to hide within-subject
		effects, rendering its relationship with the Bayes factor less
		clear in within-subject (repeated-measures) designs. This
		urgent issue can be addressed by using within-subject intervals
		in within-subject designs, which integrate four methods
		including the Wei-Nathoo-Masson (2023)

		doi:10.3758/BF03210951, the Nathoo-Kilshaw-Masson (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2018.07.005, and the Heck (2019)
