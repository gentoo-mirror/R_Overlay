		Processing Pipeline for 'SamBada' from Pre- To Post-Processing //
		Processing pipeline for 'SamBada' from pre- to post-processing.
		'SamBada' is a landscape genomic software designed to run
		univariate or multivariate logistic regression between the
		presence of a genotype and one or several environmental
		variables. See Stucki (2017) doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12629 and
		https://github.com/Sylvie/sambada. The package provides
		functions that can be classified into four categories: 1)
		Install 'SamBada' 2) Preprocessing (prepare genomic file into
		standards compatible with 'SamBada' and apply quality-control;
		retrieve environmental conditions at sampling location; prepare
		environmental file including removal of correlated variables
		and computation of population structure) 3) Processing (run
		'SamBada' on multiple cores using 'Supervision') 4) Post-
		processing (calculate p-values and q-values, produce
		interactive Manhattan plots and query 'Ensembl' database,
		produce maps).
