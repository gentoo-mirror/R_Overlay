		The LIC for T Distribution Regression Analysis // This
		comprehensive toolkit for T-distribution regression, known as
		the analysis of "TLIC" (T-distribution Linear regression
		Integrated Corrector), adopts ordinary least squares method and
		assumes that errors follow a T-distribution. This approach
		gives it an advantage when dealing with small samples or non-
		normal error distributions, and can provide more robust
		parameter estimation and hypothesis testing results.The
		philosophy of the package is described in Guo G. (2020)
