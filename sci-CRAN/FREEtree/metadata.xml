		Tree Method for High Dimensional Longitudinal Data // This tree-
		based method deals with high dimensional longitudinal data with
		correlated features through the use of a piecewise random
		effect model. FREE tree also exploits the network structure of
		the features, by first clustering them using Weighted Gene Co-
		expression Network Analysis ('WGCNA'). It then conducts a
		screening step within each cluster of features and a selecting
		step among the surviving features, which provides a relatively
		unbiased way to do feature selection. By using dominant
		principle components as regression variables at each leaf and
		the original features as splitting variables at splitting
		nodes, FREE tree delivers easily interpretable results while
		improving computational efficiency.
