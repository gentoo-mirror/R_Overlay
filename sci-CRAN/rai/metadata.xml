		Revisiting-Alpha-Investing for Polynomial Regression // A
		modified implementation of stepwise regression that greedily
		searches the space of interactions among features in order to
		build polynomial regression models. Furthermore, the hypothesis
		tests conducted are valid-post model selection due to the use
		of a revisiting procedure that implements an alpha-investing
		rule. As a result, the set of rejected sequential hypotheses is
		proven to control the marginal false discover rate. When not
		searching for polynomials, the package provides a statistically
		valid algorithm to run and terminate stepwise regression. For
		more information, see Johnson, Stine, and Foster (2019)
		arXiv:1510.06322.
