		Implementation of SparseDC Algorithm // Implements the algorithm
		described in Barron, M., Zhang, S. and Li, J. 2017, "A sparse
		differential clustering algorithm for tracing cell type changes
		via single-cell RNA-sequencing data", Nucleic Acids Research,
		gkx1113, doi:10.1093/nar/gkx1113. This algorithm clusters
		samples from two different populations, links the clusters
		across the conditions and identifies marker genes for these
		changes. The package was designed for scRNA-Seq data but is
		also applicable to many other data types, just replace cells
		with samples and genes with variables. The package also
		contains functions for estimating the parameters for SparseDC
		as outlined in the paper. We recommend that users further
		select their marker genes using the magnitude of the cluster
		centers.
