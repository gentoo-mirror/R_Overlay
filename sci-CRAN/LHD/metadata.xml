		Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) Algorithms // Contains functions
		for finding space-filling Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs), e.g.
		maximin distance LHDs. Unlike other packages, our package is
		particularly useful in the area of Design and Analysis of
		Experiments (DAE). More specifically, it is very useful in
		design of computer experiments. One advantage of our package is
		its comprehensiveness. It contains a variety of heuristic
		algorithms (and their modifications) for searching maximin
		distance LHDs. In addition to that, it also contains other
		useful tools for developing and constructing maximin distance
		LHDs. In the future, algebraic construction methods will be
		added. Please refer to the function documentations for the
		detailed references of each function. Among all the references
		we used, one reference should be highlighted here, which is
		Ruichen Jin, Wei Chen, Agus Sudjianto (2005)
		doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2004.02.014. They provided a new form of
		phi_p criterion, which does not lose the space-filling property
		and simultaneously reduces the computational complexity when
		evaluating (or re-evaluating) an LHD. Their new phi_p criterion
		is a fundamental component of our many functions. Besides, the
		computation nature of the new phi_p criterion enables our
		functions to have less CPU time.
