		Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) // Contains different algorithms
		and construction methods for optimal Latin hypercube designs
		(LHDs) with flexible sizes. Our package is comprehensive since
		it is capable of generating maximin distance LHDs, maximum
		projection LHDs, and orthogonal and nearly orthogonal LHDs.
		Detailed comparisons and summary of all the algorithms and
		construction methods in this package can be found at Hongzhi
		Wang, Qian Xiao and Abhyuday Mandal (2021)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2010.09154. This package is particularly
		useful in the area of Design and Analysis of Experiments (DAE).
		More specifically, design of computer experiments.
