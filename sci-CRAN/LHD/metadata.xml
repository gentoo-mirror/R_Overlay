		Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) Algorithms // Contains different
		algorithms for efficient Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) with
		flexible sizes. Our package is comprehensive since it is
		capable of generating maximin distance LHDs, maximum projection
		LHDs, and nearly orthogonal LHDs. Documentation for each
		algorithm includes useful information and explanation along
		with corresponding references. This package is particularly
		useful in the area of Design and Analysis of Experiments (DAE).
		More specifically, design of computer experiments.
