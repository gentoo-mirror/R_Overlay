		The (Adaptive) LASSO and Elastic Net Penalized Least Squares,
		Logistic Regression, Hybrid Huberized Support Vector Machines,
		Squared Hinge Loss Support Vector Machines and Expectile
		Regression using a Fast Generalized Coordinate Descent
		Algorithm // Implements a generalized coordinate descent (GCD)
		algorithm for computing the solution paths of the hybrid
		Huberized support vector machine (HHSVM) and its
		generalizations. Supported models include the (adaptive) LASSO
		and elastic net penalized least squares, logistic regression,
		HHSVM, squared hinge loss SVM and expectile regression.
