		Ising Model of Explanatory Coherence // Theories are one of the
		most important tools of science. Although psychologists
		discussed problems of theory in their discipline for a long
		time, weak theories are still widespread in most subfields. One
		possible reason for this is that psychologists lack the tools
		to systematically assess the quality of their theories.
		Previously a computational model for formal theory evaluation
		based on the concept of explanatory coherence was developed
		(Thagard, 1989, doi:10.1017/S0140525X00057046). However, there
		are possible improvements to this model and it is not available
		in software that psychologists typically use. Therefore, a new
		implementation of explanatory coherence based on the Ising
		model is available in this R-package.
