		Direction Dependence Analysis // A collection of tests to analyze
		the causal direction of dependence in linear models
		(Wiedermann, W.,  von Eye, A., 2025, ISBN: 9781009381390). The
		package includes functions to perform Direction Dependence
		Analysis for variable distributions, residual distributions,
		and independence properties of predictors and residuals in
		competing causal models. In addition, the package contains
		functions to test the causal direction of dependence in
		conditional models (i.e., models with interaction terms) For
		more information see https://www.ddaproject.com.
