		Stationary Linear Models // Provides statistical procedures for
		linear regression in the general context where the errors are
		assumed to be correlated. Different ways to estimate the
		asymptotic covariance matrix of the least squares estimators
		are available. Starting from this estimation of the covariance
		matrix, the confidence intervals and the usual tests on the
		parameters are modified. The functions of this package are very
		similar to those of 'lm': it contains methods such as
		summary(), plot(), confint() and predict(). The 'slm' package
		is described in the paper by E. Caron, J. Dedecker and B.
		Michel (2019), "Linear regression with stationary errors: the R
		package slm", arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.06583.
