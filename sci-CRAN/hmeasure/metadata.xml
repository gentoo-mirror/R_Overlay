		The H-Measure and Other Scalar Classification Performance Metrics
		// Classification performance metrics that are derived from the
		ROC curve of a classifier. The package includes the H-measure
		performance metric as described in
		http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-009-5119-5,
		which computes the minimum total misclassification cost,
		integrating over any uncertainty about the relative
		misclassification costs, as per a user-defined prior. It also
		offers a one-stop-shop for other scalar metrics of performance,
		including sensitivity, specificity and many others, and also
		offers plotting tools for ROC curves and related statistics.
