		Nowcast Analysis and Create Real-Time Data Basis // Methods and
		tools to estimate 'forecasts' of Brazilian macroeconomic
		variables in the near future or the recent past, i.e.
		'nowcast'. It allows: extract information in real time,
		creating a real time data base; estimate relationship between
		macroeconomic variables via dynamic factors; forecast time
		series in previous periods of reference; forecast time series
		in the current period of reference (nowcasting); recreate a
		data base simulating the information available in the past for
		evaluating forecasting models accuracy (pseudo real-time data
		base); access information available in a specific date in the
		past (real-time data base), for some variables.
