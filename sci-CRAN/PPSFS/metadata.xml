		Partial Profile Score Feature Selection in High-Dimensional
		Generalized Linear Interaction Models // This is an
		implementation of the partial profile score feature selection
		(PPSFS) approach to generalized linear (interaction) models.
		The PPSFS is highly scalable even for ultra-high-dimensional
		feature space. See the paper by Xu, Luo and Chen (2021,
		doi:10.4310/21-SII706).
