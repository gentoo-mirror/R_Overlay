		General P-Splines // Routines to construct general P-splines for
		non-uniform B-splines on arbitrary knots, proposed by Li and
		Cao (2022) arXiv:2201.06808. This P-spline variant extends the
		standard P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996)
		doi:10.1214/ss/1038425655 that are tailored for uniform
		B-splines on equidistant knots. Includes SparseD() for
		computing general difference matrices, SparseS() for computing
		derivative penalty matrix or its sparse root using a sandwich
		formula, etc. Also includes several demos on B-splines and
		P-splines. Aims to facilitate other packages to implement
		general P-splines as a smoothing tool in their model estimation
		framework.
