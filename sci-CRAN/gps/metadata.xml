		General P-Splines // General P-splines are non-uniform B-splines
		penalized by a general difference penalty, proposed by Li and
		Cao (2022) arXiv:2201.06808. Constructible on arbitrary knots,
		they extend the standard P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996)
		doi:10.1214/ss/1038425655. They are also related to the
		O-splines of O'Sullivan (1986) doi:10.1214/ss/1177013525 via a
		sandwich formula that links a general difference penalty to a
		derivative penalty. The package includes routines for setting
		up and handling difference and derivative penalties. It also
		fits P-splines and O-splines to (x, y) data (optionally
		weighted) for a grid of smoothing parameter values in the
		automatic search intervals of Li and Cao (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-022-10178-z. It aims to facilitate other
		packages to implement P-splines or O-splines as a smoothing
		tool in their model estimation framework.
