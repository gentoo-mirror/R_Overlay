		Miniature Logistic-Normal Multinomial Models // Logistic-normal
		Multinomial (LNM) models are common in problems with
		multivariate count data. This package gives a simple
		implementation with a 30 line 'Stan' script. This lightweight
		implementation makes it an easy starting point for other
		projects, in particular for downstream tasks that require
		analysis of "compositional" data. It can be applied whenever a
		multinomial probability parameter is thought to depend linearly
		on inputs in a transformed, log ratio space. Additional
		utilities make it easy to inspect, create predictions, and draw
		samples using the fitted models. More about the LNM can be
		found in Xia et al. (2013) "A Logistic Normal Multinomial
		Regression Model for Microbiome Compositional Data Analysis"
