		R Interface to Zillow Real Estate and Mortgage Data API //
		Zillow, an online real estate company, provides real estate and
		mortgage data for the United States through a REST API. The
		ZillowR package provides an R function for each API service,
		making it easy to make API calls and process the response into
		convenient, R-friendly data structures.  See
		https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm for the Zillow
		API Documentation. NOTE: Zillow deprecated their API on
		2021-09-30, and this package is now deprecated as a result.
