		Generates Spatial Problems in R for 'AMPL' // Provides methods
		for generating .dat files for use with the 'AMPL' software
		using spatial data, particularly rasters. It includes support
		for various spatial data formats and different problem types.
		By automating the process of generating 'AMPL' datasets, this
		package can help streamline optimization workflows and make it
		easier to solve complex optimization problems. The methods
		implemented in this package are described in detail in a
		publication by Fourer et al. (doi:10.1287/mnsc.36.5.519).
