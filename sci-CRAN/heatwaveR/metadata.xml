		Detect Heatwaves and Cold-Spells // The different methods of
		defining and detecting extreme events, known as heatwaves or
		cold-spells in both air and water temperature data are
		encompassed within this package. These detection algorithms may
		be used on non-temperature data as well however, this is not
		catered for explicitly here as no use of this technique in the
		literature currently exists.
