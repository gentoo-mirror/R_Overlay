		World Magnetic Model // Calculate magnetic field at a given
		location and time according to the World Magnetic Model (WMM).
		Both the main field and secular variation components are
		returned. This functionality is useful for physicists and
		geophysicists who need orthogonal components from WMM.
		Currently, this package supports annualized time inputs between
		2000 and 2020. If desired, users can specify which WMM version
		to use, e.g., the original WMM2015 release or the recent out-
		of-cycle WMM2015 release. Methods used to implement WMM,
		including the Gauss coefficients for each release, are
		described in the following publications: Chulliat et al (2019)
