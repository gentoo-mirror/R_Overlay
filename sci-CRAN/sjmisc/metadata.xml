		Data Transformation and Labelled Data Utility Functions //
		Collection of miscellaneous utility functions (especially
		intended for people coming from other statistical software
		packages like 'SPSS', and/ or who are new to R), supporting
		following common tasks when working with data : 1) Reading and
		writing data between R and other statistical software packages
		like 'SPSS', 'SAS' or 'Stata' and working with labelled data;
		this includes easy ways to get and set label attributes, to
		convert labelled vectors into factors (and vice versa), or to
		deal with multiple declared missing values etc. 2) Data
		transformation tasks like recoding, dichotomizing or grouping
		variables, setting and replacing missing values. The data
		transformation functions also support labelled data, and all
		integrate seamlessly into a 'tidyverse'-workflow.
