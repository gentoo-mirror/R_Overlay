		Two-Level Sample Selection with Optimal Site Replacement //
		Carries out a two-level sample selection where the possibility
		of an initially selected site not wanting to participate is
		anticipated, and the site is optimally replaced. The procedure
		aims to reduce bias (and/or loss of external validity) with
		respect to the target population. In selecting units and sub-
		units, 'sitepickR' uses the cube method developed by 'Deville
		Till', (2004)
		http://www.math.helsinki.fi/msm/banocoss/Deville_Tille_2004.pdf
		and described in Till (2011) https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en
		/pub/12-001-x/2011002/article/11609-eng.pdf?st=5-sx8Q8n. The
		cube method is a probability sampling method that is designed
		to satisfy criteria for balance between the sample and the
		population. Recent research has shown that this method performs
		well in simulations for studies of educational programs (see
		Fay  Olsen (2021, under review). To implement the cube method,
		'sitepickR' uses the sampling R package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=sampling. To implement
		statistical matching, 'sitepickR' uses the 'MatchIt' R package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=MatchIt.
