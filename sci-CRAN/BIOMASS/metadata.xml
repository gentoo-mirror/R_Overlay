		Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Its Uncertainty in Tropical
		Forests // Contains functions for estimating above-ground
		biomass/carbon and its uncertainty in tropical forests. These
		functions allow to (1) retrieve and correct taxonomy, (2)
		estimate wood density and its uncertainty, (3) build height-
		diameter models, (4) manage tree and plot coordinates, (5)
		estimate above-ground biomass/carbon at stand level with
		associated uncertainty. To cite BIOMASS, please use
		citation(BIOMASS). For more information, see Rjou-Mchain et al.
