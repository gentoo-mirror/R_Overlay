		Infrastructure for Running and Cycling Data from GPS-Enabled
		Tracking Devices // The aim of this package is to provide
		infrastructure for handling running and cycling data from GPS-
		enabled tracking devices. After extraction and appropriate
		manipulation of the training or competition attributes, the
		data are placed into session-based and unit-aware data objects
		of class 'trackeRdata' (S3 class). The information in the
		resulting data objects can then be visualised, summarised, and
		analysed through corresponding flexible and extensible methods.
