		Infrastructure for Running, Cycling and Swimming Data from GPS-
		Enabled Tracking Devices // Provides infrastructure for
		handling running, cycling and swimming data from GPS-enabled
		tracking devices within R. The package provides methods to
		extract, clean and organise workout and competition data into
		session-based and unit-aware data objects of class
		'trackeRdata' (S3 class). The information can then be
		visualised, summarised, and analysed through flexible and
		extensible methods. Frick and Kosmidis (2017) doi:
		10.18637/jss.v082.i07, which is updated and maintained as one
		of the vignettes, provides detailed descriptions of the package
		and its methods, and real-data demonstrations of the package
		functionality.
