		State-Space Mass-Balance Model for Marine Ecosystems // Fits a
		state-space mass-balance model for marine ecosystems, which
		implements dynamics derived from 'Ecopath with Ecosim'
		https://ecopath.org/ while fitting to time-series of fishery
		catch, biomass indices, age-composition samples, and weight-at-
		age data. Package 'ecostate' fits biological parameters (e.g.,
		equilibrium mass) and measurement parameters (e.g.,
		catchability coefficients) jointly with residual variation in
		process errors, and can include Bayesian priors for parameters.
