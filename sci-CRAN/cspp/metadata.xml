		A Tool for the Correlates of State Policy Project Data // A tool
		that imports, subsets, visualizes, and exports the Correlates
		of State Policy Project dataset assembled by Marty P. Jordan
		and Matt Grossmann (2020) http://ippsr.msu.edu/public-
		policy/correlates-state-policy. The Correlates data contains
		over 2000 variables across more than 100 years that pertain to
		state politics and policy in the United States. Users with only
		a basic understanding of R can subset this data across multiple
		dimensions, export their search results, create map
		visualizations, export the citations associated with their
		searches, and more.
