		Road Network Projection // Project road network development based
		on an existing road network, target locations to be connected
		by roads and a cost surface. Road projection methods include
		minimum spanning tree with least cost path (Kruskal's algorithm
		(1956) doi:10.2307/2033241), least cost path (Dijkstra's
		algorithm (1959) doi:10.1007/BF01386390) or snapping. These
		road network projection methods are ideal for use with land
		cover change projection models.
