		Road Network Projection // Iterative least cost path and minimum
		spanning tree methods for projecting forest road networks. The
		methods connect a set of target points to an existing road
		network using 'igraph' https://igraph.org to identify least
		cost routes. The cost of constructing a road segment between
		adjacent pixels is determined by a user supplied weight raster
		and a weight function; options include the average of adjacent
		weight raster values, and a function of the elevation
		differences between adjacent cells that penalizes steep grades.
		These road network projection methods are intended for
		integration into R workflows and modelling frameworks used for
		forecasting forest change, and can be applied over multiple
		time-steps without rebuilding a graph at each time-step.
