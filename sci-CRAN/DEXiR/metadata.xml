		'DEXi' Library // A software package for using 'DEXi' models.
		'DEXi' models are hierarchical qualitative multi-criteria
		decision models developed according to the method DEX (Decision
		EXpert,
		https://dex.ijs.si/documentation/DEX_Method/DEX_Method.html),
		using the program 'DEXi'
		(https://kt.ijs.si/MarkoBohanec/dexi.html) or 'DEXiWin'
		(https://dex.ijs.si/dexisuite/dexiwin.html). A typical workflow
		with 'DEXiR' consists of: (1) reading a '.dxi' file, previously
		made using the 'DEXi' software (function read_dexi()), (2)
		making a data frame containing input values of one or more
		decision alternatives, (3) evaluating those alternatives
		(function evaluate()), (4) analyzing alternatives
		(selective_explanation(), plus_minus(),
		compare_alternatives()), (5) drawing charts. 'DEXiR' is
		restricted to using models produced externally by the 'DEXi'
		software and does not provide functionality for creating and/or
		editing 'DEXi' models directly in 'R'.
