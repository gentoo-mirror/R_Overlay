		B-Spline Interpolation and Regression // Build and use B-splines
		for interpolation and regression. In case of regression,
		equality constraints as well as monotonicity requirement can be
		imposed. Moreover, knot positions (not only spline
		coefficients) can be part of optimized parameters too. User is
		provided with functions calculating spline values at arbitrary
		points. This functions can be differentiated to obtain
		B-splines calculating derivatives at any point. B-splines of
		this package can simultaneously operate on a series of curves
		sharing the same set of knots. 'bspline' is written with
		concern about computing performance that's why the basis
		calculation is implemented in C++. The rest is implemented in R
		but without notable impact on computing speed.
