		B-Spline Interpolation and Regression // Build and use B-splines
		for interpolation and regression. In case of regression,
		equality constraints as well as monotonicity and/or positivity
		of B-spline weights can be imposed. Moreover, knot positions
		can be on regular grid or be part of optimized parameters too
		(in addition to the spline weights). For this end, 'bspline' is
		able to calculate Jacobian of basis vectors as function of knot
		positions. User is provided with functions calculating spline
		values at arbitrary points. These functions can be
		differentiated and integrated to obtain B-splines calculating
		derivatives/integrals at any point. B-splines of this package
		can simultaneously operate on a series of curves sharing the
		same set of knots. 'bspline' is written with concern about
		computing performance that's why the basis and Jacobian
		calculation is implemented in C++. The rest is implemented in R
		but without notable impact on computing speed.
