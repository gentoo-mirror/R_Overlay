		C-Statistics for Risk Prediction Models with Censored Survival
		Data // Performs inference for C of risk prediction models with
		censored survival data, using the method proposed by Uno et al.
		(2011) doi:10.1002/sim.4154. Inference for the difference in C
		between two competing prediction models is also implemented.
