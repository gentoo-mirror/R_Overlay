		Feature Stores for the 'diseasy' Framework // Simple feature
		stores and tools for creating personalised feature stores.
		'diseasystore' powers feature stores which can automatically
		link and aggregate features to a given stratification level.
		These feature stores are automatically time-versioned (powered
		by the 'SCDB' package) and allows you to easily and dynamically
		compute features as part of your continuous integration.
