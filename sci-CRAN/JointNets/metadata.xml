		End-to-End Sparse Gaussian Graphical Model Simulation,
		Estimation, Visualization, Evaluation and Application // An
		end-to-end package for learning multiple sparse Gaussian
		graphical models and nonparanormal models from Heterogeneous
		Data with Additional Knowledge. It is able to simulate multiple
		related graphs as well as produce samples drawn from them.
		Multiple state-of-the-art sparse Gaussian graphical model
		estimators are included to both multiple and difference
		estimation. Graph visualization is available in 2D as well as
		3D, designed specifically for brain. Moreover, a set of
		evaluation metrics are integrated for easy exploration with
		model validity. Finally, classification using graphical model
		is achieved with Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. The package
		comes with multiple demos with datasets from various fields.
