		Finds RNASeq Source Tissues Using In Situ Hybridisation Data //
		Finds the most likely originating tissue(s) and developmental
		stage(s) of tissue-specific RNA sequencing data. The package
		identifies both pure transcriptomes and mixtures of
		transcriptomes. The most likely identity is found through
		comparisons of the sequencing data with high-throughput in situ
		hybridisation patterns. Typical uses are the identification of
		cancer cell origins, validation of cell culture strain
		identities, validation of single-cell transcriptomes, and
		validation of identity and purity of flow-sorting and
		dissection sequencing products.
