		Mean Squared Out-of-Sample Error Projection // Projects mean
		squared out-of-sample error for a linear regression based upon
		the methodology developed in Rohlfs (2022)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2209.01493.  It consumes as inputs the lm
		object from an estimated OLS regression (based on the "training
		sample") and a data.frame of out-of-sample cases (the "test
		sample") that have non-missing values for the same predictors.
		The test sample may or may not include data on the outcome
		variable; if it does, that variable is not used. The aim of the
		exercise is to project what what mean squared out-of-sample
		error can be expected given the predictor values supplied in
		the test sample. Output consists of a list of three elements:
		the projected mean squared out-of-sample error, the projected
		out-of-sample R-squared, and a vector of out-of-sample "hat" or
		"leverage" values, as defined in the paper.
