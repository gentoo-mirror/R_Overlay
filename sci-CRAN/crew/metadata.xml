		A Distributed Worker Launcher // In computationally demanding
		analysis projects, statisticians and data scientists
		asynchronously deploy long-running tasks to distributed
		systems, ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services
		The 'NNG'-powered 'mirai' R package by Gao (2023)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mirai is a sleek and
		sophisticated scheduler that efficiently processes these
		intense workloads. The 'crew' package extends 'mirai' with a
		unifying interface for third-party worker launchers.
		Inspiration also comes from packages 'future' by Bengtsson
		(2021) doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048, 'rrq' by FitzJohn and Ashton
		(2023) https://github.com/mrc-ide/rrq, 'clustermq' by Schubert
		(2019) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz284), and 'batchtools' by
		Lang, Bischel, and Surmann (2017) doi:10.21105/joss.00135.
