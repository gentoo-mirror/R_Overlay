		Fast and Flexible Implementations of Exploratory Factor Analysis
		Tools // Provides functions to perform exploratory factor
		analysis (EFA) procedures and compare their solutions. The goal
		is to provide state-of-the-art factor retention methods and a
		high degree of flexibility in the EFA procedures. This way, for
		example, implementations from R 'psych' and 'SPSS' can be
		compared. Moreover, functions for Schmid-Leiman transformation
		and the computation of omegas are provided. To speed up the
		analyses, some of the iterative procedures, like principal axis
		factoring (PAF), are implemented in C++.
