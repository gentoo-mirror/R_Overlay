		Nested Phylogenetic Tree Simulator // Simulates nested
		phylogenetic trees (gene trees in species tree, symbiont trees
		in host trees) using birth-death processes and transfers
		between lineages. Simulations of gene trees within species
		trees are performed using a three-tree model with species
		trees, locus trees, and gene trees. The cophylogenetic birth-
		death process is used to simulate sets of host and symbiont
		trees with extant associations between tips. For more
		information about the three-tree model see: Mallo et al. (2015)
