		Generalized Path Analysis for Social Networks // The social
		network literature features numerous methods for assigning
		value to paths as a function of their ties. 'gretel' systemizes
		these approaches, casting them as instances of a generalized
		path value function indexed by a penalty parameter. The package
		also calculates probabilistic path value and identifies optimal
		paths in either value framework. Finally, proximity matrices
		can be generated in these frameworks that capture high-order
		connections overlooked in primitive adjacency sociomatrices.
		Novel methods are described in Buch (2019)
		https://davidbuch.github.io/analyzing-networks-with-
		gretel.html. More traditional methods are also implemented, as
		described in Yang, Knoke (2001)
		doi:10.1016/S0378-8733(01)00043-0.
