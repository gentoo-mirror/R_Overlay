		Nonparametric Analysis of Covariance // A collection of R
		functions to perform nonparametric analysis of covariance for
		regression curves or surfaces. Testing the equality or
		parallelism of nonparametric curves or surfaces is equivalent
		to analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance
		(ANCOVA) for one-sample functional data. Three different
		testing methods are available in the package, including one
		based on L-2 distance, one based on an ANOVA statistic, and one
		based on variance estimators.
