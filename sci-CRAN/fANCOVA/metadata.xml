		Nonparametric Analysis of Covariance // This package contains a
		collection of R functions to perform nonparametric analysis of
		covariance for regression curves or surfaces. Testing the
		equality or parallelism of nonparametric curves or surfaces is
		equivalent to analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of
		covariance (ANCOVA) for one-sample functional data. Three
		different testing methods are available in the package,
		including one based on L-2 distance, one based on an ANOVA
		statistic, and one based on variance estimators.
