		Independent Component Analysis for Grouped Data // Contains an
		implementation of an independent component analysis (ICA) for
		grouped data. The main function groupICA() performs a blind
		source separation, by maximizing an independence across sources
		and allows to adjust for varying confounding for user-specified
		groups. Additionally, the package contains the function
		uwedge() which can be used to approximately jointly diagonalize
		a list of matrices. For more details see the project website
		https://sweichwald.de/groupICA/.
