		Win Ratio Analysis of Composite Time-to-Event Outcomes //
		Implements various win ratio methodologies for composite
		endpoints of death and non-fatal events, including the
		(stratified) proportional win-fractions (PW) regression models
		(Mao and Wang, 2020 doi:10.1111/biom.13382), (stratified) two-
		sample tests with possibly recurrent nonfatal event, and sample
		size calculation for standard win ratio test (Mao et al., 2021
		doi:10.1111/biom.13501).
