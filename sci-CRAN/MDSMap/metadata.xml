		High Density Genetic Linkage Mapping using Multidimensional
		Scaling // Estimate genetic linkage maps for markers on a
		single chromosome (or in a single linkage group) from pairwise
		recombination fractions or intermarker distances using weighted
		metric multidimensional scaling. The methods are suitable for
		autotetraploid as well as diploid populations. Options for
		assessing the fit to a known map are also provided. Methods are
		discussed in detail in Preedy and Hackett (2016)
