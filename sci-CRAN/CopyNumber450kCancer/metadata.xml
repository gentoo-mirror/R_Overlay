		Baseline Correction for Copy Number Data from Cancer Samples //
		The 450k arrays are frequently used in the epigenetic studies,
		the copy number calling from the 450k data is possible but it
		faces some difficulties in cancer samples regarding the
		determination of the copy number status due to the false sample
		centering and baseline shifting. Without solving this issue the
		CN calling will be inaccurate. CopyNumber450kCancer-package was
		designed to correct the baseline in cancer samples using the
		Maximum Density Peak Estimation (MDPE) method. The main
		advantages for CopyNumber450kCancer-package are: Fast (few
		seconds per sample), high accuracy rate, in-sample correction,
		no input parameters needed, low computer sources required, and
		adaptable for 450k-similar technologies.
