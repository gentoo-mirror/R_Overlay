		A 'ggplot2' Extension Inspired by 'GraphPad Prism' // Provides
		various themes, palettes, and other functions that are used to
		customise ggplots to look like they were made in 'GraphPad
		Prism'. The 'Prism'-look is achieved with theme_prism() and
		scale_fill|colour_prism(), axes can be changed with custom
		guides like guide_prism_minor(), and significance indicators
		added with add_pvalue().
