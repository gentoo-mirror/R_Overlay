		Spatiotemporal Point Patterns Simulation // Generates artificial
		point patterns marked by their spatial and temporal signatures.
		The resulting point cloud may exhibit inherent interactions
		between both signatures. The simulation integrates
		microsimulation (Holm, E.,
		(2017)doi:10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0320) and agent-based
		models (Bonabeau, E., (2002)doi:10.1073/pnas.082080899),
		beginning with the configuration of movement characteristics
		for the specified agents (referred to as 'walkers') and their
		interactions within the simulation environment. These
		interactions (Quaglietta, L. and Porto, M.,
		(2019)doi:10.1186/s40462-019-0154-8) result in specific
		spatiotemporal patterns that can be visualized, analyzed, and
		used for various analytical purposes. Given the growing
		scarcity of detailed spatiotemporal data across many domains,
		this package provides an alternative data source for
		applications in social and life sciences.
