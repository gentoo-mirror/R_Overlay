		Flexible Phenotype Simulation from Different Genetic and Noise
		Models // Simulation is a critical part of method development
		and assessment in quantitative genetics. 'PhenotypeSimulator'
		allows for the flexible simulation of phenotypes under
		different models, including genetic variant and  infinitesimal
		genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as
		non-genetic covariate effects, observational noise and
		additional correlation effects. The different phenotype
		components are combined into a final phenotype while
		controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of
		the components. For each effect component, the number of
		variables, their distribution and the design of their effect
		across traits can be customised. For the simulation of the
		genetic effects, external genotype data from a number of
		standard software ('plink', 'hapgen2'/ 'impute2', 'genome',
		'bimbam', simple text files) can be imported. The final
		simulated phenotypes and its components can be automatically
		saved into .rds or .csv files. In addition, they can be saved
		in formats compatible with commonly used genetic association
		software ('gemma', 'bimbam', 'plink', 'snptest').
