		Flexible Phenotype Simulation from Different Genetic and Noise
		Models // Phenotype simulator allows for the flexible
		simulation of phenotypes under different models, including
		fixed and background genetic effects as well as correlated,
		fixed and background noise effects. Different phenotypic
		effects can be combined into a final phenotype while controling
		for the proportion of variance explained by each of the
		components. For each component, the number of variables, their
		distribution and the design of their effect across traits can
		be customised. The final simulated phenotypes and its
		components can be automatically saved into .rds or .csv files.
		In addition, for simulated genotypes, export into plink format
		is possible.
