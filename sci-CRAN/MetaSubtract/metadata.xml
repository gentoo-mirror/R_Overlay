		Subtracting Summary Statistics of One or more Cohorts from Meta-
		GWAS Results // If results from a meta-GWAS are used for
		validation in one of the cohorts that was included in the meta-
		analysis, this will yield biased (i.e. too optimistic) results.
		The validation cohort needs to be independent from the meta-
		Genome-Wide-Association-Study (meta-GWAS) results.
		'MetaSubtract' will subtract the results of the respective
		cohort from the meta-GWAS results analytically without having
		to redo the meta-GWAS analysis using the leave-one-out
		methodology. It can handle different meta-analyses methods and
		takes into account if single or double genomic control
		correction was applied to the original meta-analysis. It can
		also handle different meta-analysis methods. It can be used for
		whole GWAS, but also for a limited set of genetic markers.
