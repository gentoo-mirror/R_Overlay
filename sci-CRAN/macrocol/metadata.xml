		Colombian Macro-Financial Time Series Generator // This
		repository aims to contribute to the econometric models'
		production with Colombian data, by providing a set of web-
		scrapping functions of some of the main macro-financial
		indicators. All the sources are public and free, but the
		advantage of these functions is that they directly download and
		harmonize the information in R's environment. No need to import
		or download additional files. You only need an internet
		connection!
