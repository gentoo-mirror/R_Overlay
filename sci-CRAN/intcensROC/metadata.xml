		AUC Estimation of Interval Censored Survival Data // The kernel
		of this 'Rcpp' based package is an efficient implementation of
		the generalized gradient projection method for spline function
		based constrained maximum likelihood estimator for interval
		censored survival data (Wu, Yuan; Zhang, Ying. Partially
		monotone tensor spline estimation of the joint distribution
		function with bivariate current status data. Ann. Statist. 40,
		2012, 1609-1636 doi:10.1214/12-AOS1016). The key function
		computes the density function of the joint distribution of
		event time and the marker and returns the receiver operating
		characteristic (ROC) curve for the interval censored survival
		data as well as area under the curve (AUC).
