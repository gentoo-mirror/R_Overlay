		datasets to support inference with the open access book "An
		Introduction to Bayesian Thinking", available online
		https://statswithr.github.io/book and  online videos for the
		"Statistics with R Specialization"
		https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics. which
		includes an introduction to Bayesian inference and decision
		making for one and two sample credible intervals and hypothesis
		testing for Gaussian and Binomial data, in addition to
		frequentist inference using model-based and randomization-based
		methods. To help with understanding concepts, 'shiny'
		applications are used to aide visualization of sampling
		distributions, credible intervals, hypothesis testing,
