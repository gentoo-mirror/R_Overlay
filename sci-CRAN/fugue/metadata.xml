		Sensitivity Analysis Optimized for Matched Sets of Varied Sizes
		// As in music, a fugue statistic repeats a theme in small
		variations.  Here, the psi-function that defines an m-statistic
		is slightly altered to maintain the same design sensitivity in
		matched sets of different sizes.  The main functions in the
		package are sen() and senCI().  For sensitivity analyses for
		m-statistics, see Rosenbaum (2007) Biometrics 63 456-464
