		High-Throughput Toxicokinetics // Functions and data tables for
		simulation and statistical analysis of chemical toxicokinetics
		("TK") as in Pearce et al. (2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i04.
		Chemical-specific in vitro data have been obtained from
		relatively high throughput experiments. Both physiologically-
		based ("PBTK") and empirical (e.g., one compartment) "TK"
		models can be parameterized for several hundred chemicals and
		multiple species. These models are solved efficiently, often
		using compiled (C-based) code. A Monte Carlo sampler is
		included for simulating biological variability (Ring et al.,
		2017 doi:10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004) and measurement
		limitations. Calibrated methods are included for predicting
		tissue:plasma partition coefficients and volume of distribution
		(Pearce et al., 2017 doi:10.1007/s10928-017-9548-7). These
		functions and data provide a set of tools for in vitro-in vivo
		extrapolation ("IVIVE") of high throughput screening data
		(e.g., Tox21, ToxCast) to real-world exposures via reverse
		dosimetry (also known as "RTK") (Wetmore et al., 2015
		doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfv171).
