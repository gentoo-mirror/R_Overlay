		High-Throughput Toxicokinetics // Pre-made models that can be
		rapidly tailored to various chemicals and species using
		chemical-specific in vitro data and physiological information.
		These tools allow incorporation of chemical toxicokinetics
		("TK") and in vitro-in vivo extrapolation ("IVIVE") into
		bioinformatics, as described by Pearce et al. (2017)
		(doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i04). Chemical-specific in vitro data
		characterizing toxicokinetics have been obtained from
		relatively high-throughput experiments.   The chemical-
		independent ("generic") physiologically-based ("PBTK") and
		empirical (for example, one compartment) "TK" models included
		here can be parameterized with in vitro data or in silico
		predictions which are provided for thousands of chemicals,
		multiple exposure routes, and various species. High throughput
		toxicokinetics ("HTTK") is the combination of in vitro data and
		generic models. We establish the expected accuracy of HTTK for
		chemicals without in vivo data through statistical evaluation
		of HTTK predictions for chemicals where in vivo data do exist.
		The models are systems of ordinary differential equations that
		are developed in MCSim and solved using compiled (C-based) code
		for speed. A Monte Carlo sampler is included for simulating
		human biological variability (Ring et al., 2017
		doi:10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004) and propagating parameter
		uncertainty (Wambaugh et al., 2019 doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfz205).
		Empirically calibrated methods are included for predicting
		tissue:plasma partition coefficients and volume of distribution
		(Pearce et al., 2017 doi:10.1007/s10928-017-9548-7). These
		functions and data provide a set of tools for using IVIVE to
		convert concentrations from high-throughput screening
		experiments (for example, Tox21, ToxCast) to real-world
		exposures via reverse dosimetry (also known as "RTK") (Wetmore
		et al., 2015 doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfv171).
