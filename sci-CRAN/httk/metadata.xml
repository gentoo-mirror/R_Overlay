		High-Throughput Toxicokinetics // Generic models and chemical-
		specific data for simulation and statistical analysis of
		chemical toxicokinetics ("TK") as described by Pearce et al.
		(2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i04. Chemical-specific in vitro
		data have been obtained from relatively high-throughput
		experiments. Both physiologically-based ("PBTK") and empirical
		(for example, one compartment) "TK" models can be parameterized
		with the data provided for thousands of chemicals, multiple
		exposure routes, and various species. The models consist of
		systems of ordinary differential equations which are solved
		using compiled (C-based) code for speed. A Monte Carlo sampler
		is included, which allows for simulating human biological
		variability (Ring et al., 2017
		doi:10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004) and propagating parameter
		uncertainty. Calibrated methods are included for predicting
		tissue:plasma partition coefficients and volume of distribution
		(Pearce et al., 2017 doi:10.1007/s10928-017-9548-7). These
		functions and data provide a set of tools for in vitro-in vivo
		extrapolation ("IVIVE") of high-throughput screening data (for
		example, Tox21, ToxCast) to real-world exposures via reverse
		dosimetry (also known as "RTK") (Wetmore et al., 2015
		doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfv171).
