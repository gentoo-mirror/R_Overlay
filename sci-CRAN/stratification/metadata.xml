		Univariate Stratification of Survey Populations // Univariate
		stratification of survey populations with a generalization of
		the Lavallee-Hidiroglou method of stratum construction. The
		generalized method takes into account a discrepancy between the
		stratification variable and the survey variable. The
		determination of the optimal boundaries also incorporate, if
		desired, an anticipated non-response, a take-all stratum for
		large units, a take-none stratum for small units, and a
		certainty stratum to ensure that some specific units are in the
		sample. The well known cumulative root frequency rule of
		Dalenius and Hodges and the geometric rule of Gunning and
		Horgan are also implemented.
