		Interpreting High Resolution Mass Spectra // High resolution mass
		spectrometry yields often large data sets of spectra from
		compounds which are not present in available libraries. These
		spectra need to be annotated and interpreted.
		'InterpretMSSpectrum' provides a set of functions to perform
		such tasks for Electrospray-Ionization and Atmospheric-
		Pressure-Chemical-Ionization derived data in positive and
		negative ionization mode.
