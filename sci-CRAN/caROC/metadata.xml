		Continuous Biomarker Evaluation with Adjustment of Covariates //
		Compute covariate-adjusted specificity at controlled
		sensitivity level, or covariate-adjusted sensitivity at
		controlled specificity level, or covariate-adjust receiver
		operating characteristic curve, or covariate-adjusted
		thresholds at controlled sensitivity/specificity level. All
		statistics could also be computed for specific sub-populations
		given their covariate values. Methods are described in Ziyi Li,
		Yijian Huang, Datta Patil, Martin G. Sanda (2021+) "Covariate
		adjustment in continuous biomarker assessment".
