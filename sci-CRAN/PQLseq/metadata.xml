		Efficient Mixed Model Analysis of Count Data in Large-Scale
		Genomic Sequencing Studies // An efficient tool designed for
		differential analysis of large-scale RNA sequencing (RNAseq)
		data and Bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) data in the presence of
		individual relatedness and population structure. 'PQLseq' first
		fits a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with adjusted
		covariates, predictor of interest and random effects to account
		for population structure and individual relatedness, and then
		performs Wald tests for each gene in RNAseq or site in BSseq.
