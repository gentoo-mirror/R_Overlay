		R Interface to Google Slides // Previously, when one is working
		with in the Google Ecosystem (Using Google Drive etc), there is
		hardly any good workflow of getting the values calculated from
		R and getting that into Google Slides. The normal and easy way
		out would be to just copy your work over but when you have a
		number of analysis to present with a lot of changes between
		each environment, it just becomes quite cumbersome.
