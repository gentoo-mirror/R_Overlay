		Stable Balancing Weights for Causal Inference and Missing Data //
		Implements the Stable Balancing Weights by Zubizarreta (2015)
		DOI:10.1080/01621459.2015.1023805. These are the weights of
		minimum variance that approximately balance the empirical
		distribution of the observed covariates. For an overview, see
		Chattopadhyay, Hase and Zubizarreta (2020)
		DOI:10.1002/sim.8659. To solve the optimization problem in
		'sbw', the default solver is 'quadprog', which is readily
		available through CRAN. The solver 'osqp' is also posted on
		CRAN. To enhance the performance of 'sbw', users are encouraged
		to install other solvers such as 'gurobi' and 'Rmosek', which
		require special installation. For the installation of gurobi
		and pogs, please follow the instructions at https://www.gurobi.
		com/documentation/current/refman/r_ins_the_r_package.html and
		http://foges.github.io/pogs/stp/r.
