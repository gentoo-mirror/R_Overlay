		Unified Zero-Inflated Hurdle Regression Models // Run a Gibbs
		sampler for hurdle models to analyze data showing an excess of
		zeros, which is common in zero-inflated count and semi-
		continuous models. The package includes the hurdle model under
		Gaussian, Gamma, inverse Gaussian, Weibull, Exponential, Beta,
		Poisson, negative binomial, logarithmic, Bell, generalized
		Poisson, and binomial distributional assumptions. The models
		described in Ganjali et al. (2024).
