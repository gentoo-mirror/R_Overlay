		IBM in-Database Analytics for R // Functionality required to
		efficiently use R with IBM(R) Db2(R) Warehouse offerings
		(formerly IBM dashDB(R)) and IBM Db2 for z/OS(R) in conjunction
		with IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS. Many basic and
		complex R operations are pushed down into the database, which
		removes the main memory boundary of R and allows to make full
		use of parallel processing in the underlying database. For
		executing R-functions in a multi-node environment in parallel
		the idaTApply() function requires the 'SparkR' package
		(https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html). The
		optional 'ggplot2' package is needed for the plot.idaLm()
		function only.
