		Classification and Regression with Structured and Mixed-Type Data
		// Implementation of Energy Trees, a statistical model to
		perform classification and regression with structured and
		mixed-type data. The model has a similar structure to
		Conditional Trees, but brings in Energy Statistics to test
		independence between variables that are possibly structured and
		of different nature. Currently, the package covers functions
		and graphs as structured covariates. It builds upon 'partykit'
		to provide functionalities for fitting, printing, plotting, and
		predicting with Energy Trees. Energy Trees are described in
		Giubilei et al. (2022) arXiv:2207.04430.
