		Methods for Graphical Models and Causal Inference // Functions
		for causal structure learning and causal inference using
		graphical models. The main algorithms for causal structure
		learning are PC (for observational data without hidden
		variables), FCI and RFCI (for observational data with hidden
		variables), and GIES (for a mix of data from observational
		studies (i.e. observational data) and data from experiments
		involving interventions (i.e. interventional data) without
		hidden variables). For causal inference the IDA algorithm, the
		Generalized Backdoor Criterion (GBC), the Generalized
		Adjustment Criterion (GAC) and some related functions are
		implemented. Functions for incorporating background knowledge
		are provided.
