		Signature Overrepresentation Analysis // Pathway Analysis is
		statistically linking observations on the molecular level to
		biological processes or pathways on the systems(i.e., organism,
		organ, tissue, cell) level. Traditionally, pathway analysis
		methods regard pathways as collections of single genes and
		treat all genes in a pathway as equally informative. However,
		this can lead to identifying spurious pathways as statistically
		significant since components are often shared amongst pathways.
		SIGORA seeks to avoid this pitfall by focusing on genes or gene
		pairs that are (as a combination) specific to a single pathway.
		In relying on such pathway gene-pair signatures (Pathway-GPS),
		SIGORA inherently uses the status of other genes in the
		experimental context to identify the most relevant pathways.
		The current version allows for pathway analysis of human and
		mouse datasets. In addition, it contains pre-computed Pathway-
		GPS data for pathways in the KEGG and  Reactome pathway
		repositories and mechanisms for extracting GPS for user-
		supplied repositories.
