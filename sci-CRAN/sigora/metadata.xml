		Signature Overrepresentation Analysis // Pathway Analysis is the
		process of statistically linking observations on the molecular
		level to biological processes or pathways on the systems(i.e.
		organism, organ, tissue, cell) level. Traditionally, pathway
		analysis methods regard pathways as collections of single genes
		and treat all genes in a pathway as equally informative. This
		can lead to identification of spurious pathways as
		statistically significant, since components are often shared
		amongst pathways. SIGORA seeks to avoid this pitfall by
		focusing on genes or gene-pairs that are (as a combination)
		specific to a single pathway.  In relying on such pathway gene-
		pair signatures (Pathway-GPS), SIGORA inherently uses the
		status of other genes in the experimental context to identify
		the most relevant pathways. The current version allows for
		pathway analysis of human and mouse datasets and contains pre-
		computed Pathway-GPS data for pathways in the KEGG and Reactome
		pathway repositories as well as mechanisms for extracting GPS
		for user supplied repositories.
