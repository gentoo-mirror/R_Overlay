		Fitting of Exponential Autoregressive Moving Average (EXPARMA)
		Model // The amplitude-dependent autoregressive time series
		model (EXPAR) proposed by Haggan and Ozaki (1981)
		doi:10.2307/2335819 was improved by incorporating the moving
		average (MA) framework for capturing the variability
		efficiently. Parameters of the EXPARMA model can be estimated
		using this package. The user is provided with the best fitted
		EXPARMA model for the data set under consideration.
