		Higher Criticism Tuned Regression // A novel searching scheme for
		tuning parameter in high-dimensional penalized regression. We
		propose a new estimate of the regularization parameter based on
		an estimated lower bound of the proportion of false null
		hypotheses (Meinshausen and Rice (2006)
		doi:10.1214/009053605000000741). The bound is estimated by
		applying the empirical null distribution of the higher
		criticism statistic, a second-level significance testing, which
		is constructed by dependent p-values from a multi-split
		regression and aggregation method (Jeng, Zhang and Tzeng (2019)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1518236). An estimate of tuning
		parameter in penalized regression is decided corresponding to
		the lower bound of the proportion of false null hypotheses.
		Different penalized regression methods are provided in the
		multi-split algorithm.
