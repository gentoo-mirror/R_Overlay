		Multivariate Information Inductive Causation // We report an
		information-theoretic method which learns a large class of
		causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational
		data, while including the effects of unobserved latent
		variables, commonly found in many datasets. Starting from a
		complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable
		edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from
		indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from
		randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then
		oriented based on the signature of causality in observational
		data. This approach can be applied on a wide range of datasets
		and provide new biological insights on regulatory networks from
		single cell expression data, genomic alterations during tumor
		development and co-evolving residues in protein structures. For
		more information you can refer to: Verny et al. Plos Comput
		Biol. (2017) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005662.
