		Learning Causal or Non-Causal Graphical Models Using Information
		Theory // Multivariate Information-based Inductive Causation,
		better known by its acronym MIIC, is a causal discovery method,
		based on information theory principles, which learns a large
		class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely
		observational data, while including the effects of unobserved
		latent variables. Starting from a complete graph, the method
		iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering
		significant information contributions from indirect paths, and
		assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of
		available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on
		the signature of causality in observational data. The recent
		more interpretable MIIC extension (iMIIC) further distinguishes
		genuine causes from putative and latent causal effects, while
		scaling to very large datasets (hundreds of thousands of
		samples). Since the version 2.0, MIIC also includes a temporal
		mode (tMIIC) to learn temporal causal graphs from stationary
		time series data. MIIC has been applied to a wide range of
		biological and biomedical data, such as single cell gene
		expression data, genomic alterations in tumors, live-cell time-
		lapse imaging data (CausalXtract), as well as medical records
		of patients. MIIC brings unique insights based on causal
		interpretation and could be used in a broad range of other data
		science domains (technology, climatology, economy, ...). For
