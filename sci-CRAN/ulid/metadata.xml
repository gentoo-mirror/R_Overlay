		Generate Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable
		Identifiers // Universally unique identifiers ('UUIDs') can be
		suboptimal for many uses-cases because they aren't the most
		character efficient way of encoding 128 bits of randomness;
		v1/v2 versions are impractical in many environments, as they
		require access to a unique, stable MAC address; v3/v5 versions
		require a unique seed and produce randomly distributed IDs,
		which can cause fragmentation in many data structures; v4
		provides no other information than randomness which can cause
		fragmentation in many data structures. 'ULIDs'
		(https://github.com/ulid/spec) have 128-bit compatibility with
		'UUID', 1.21e+24 unique 'ULIDs' per millisecond, are
		lexicographically sortable, canonically encoded as a 26
		character string, as opposed to the 36 character 'UUID', use
		Crockford's 'base32' for better efficiency and readability (5
		bits per character), are case insensitive, have no special
		characters (i.e. are 'URL' safe) and have a onotonic sort order
		(correctly detects and handles the same millisecond).
