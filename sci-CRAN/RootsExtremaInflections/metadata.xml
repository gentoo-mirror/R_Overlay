		Finds Roots, Extrema and Inflection Points of a Curve //
		Implementation of the Taylor Regression Estimator method which
		is described in Christopoulos
		(2014,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261562841) for
		finding the root, extreme or inflection point of a curve, when
		we only have a set of probably noisy xy points for it. The
		method uses a suitable polynomial regression in order to find
		the coefficients of the relevant Taylor polynomial for the
		function that has generated our data. Optional use of parallel
		computing under request.
