		distribution, quantile and generation functions of some obscure
		probability distributions, including the doubly non-central t,
		F, Beta, and Eta distributions; the lambda-prime and K-prime;
		the upsilon distribution; the (weighted) sum of non-central
		chi-squares to a power; the (weighted) sum of log non-central
		chi-squares; the product of non-central chi-squares to powers;
		the product of doubly non-central F variables; the product of
		independent normals.
