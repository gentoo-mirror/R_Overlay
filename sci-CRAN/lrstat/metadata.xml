		Power and Sample Size Calculation for Non-Proportional Hazards
		and Beyond // Performs power and sample size calculation for
		non-proportional hazards model using the Fleming-Harrington
		family of weighted log-rank tests. The sequentially calculated
		log-rank test score statistics are assumed to have independent
		increments as characterized in Anastasios A. Tsiatis (1982)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.1982.10477898. The mean and variance of
		log-rank test score statistics are calculated based on Kaifeng
		Lu (2021) doi:10.1002/pst.2069. The boundary crossing
		probabilities are calculated using the recursive integration
		algorithm described in Christopher Jennison and Bruce W.
		Turnbull (2000, ISBN:0849303168). The package can also be used
		for continuous, binary, and count data. For continuous data, it
		can handle missing data through mixed-model for repeated
		measures (MMRM). In crossover designs, it can estimate direct
		treatment effects while accounting for carryover effects. For
		binary data, it can design Simon's 2-stage, modified toxicity
		probability-2 (mTPI-2), and Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN)
		trials. For count data, it can design group sequential trials
		for negative binomial endpoints with censoring. Additionally,
		it facilitates group sequential equivalence trials for all
		supported data types. Moreover, it can design adaptive group
		sequential trials for changes in sample size, error spending
		function, number and spacing or future looks. Finally, it
		offers various options for adjusted p-values, including
		graphical and gatekeeping procedures.
