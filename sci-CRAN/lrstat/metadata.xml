		Power and Sample Size Calculation for Non-Proportional Hazards //
		Performs power and sample size calculation for non-proportional
		hazards model using the Fleming-Harrington family of weighted
		log-rank tests. The sequentially calculated log-rank test score
		statistics are assumed to have independent increments as
		characterized in Anastasios A. Tsiatis (1982)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.1982.10477898. The mean and variance of
		log-rank test score statistics are calculated based on Kaifeng
		Lu (2021) doi:10.1002/pst.2069. The boundary crossing
		probabilities are calculated using the recursive integration
		algorithm described in Christopher Jennison and Bruce W.
		Turnbull (2000, ISBN:0849303168).
