		Common Argument Checks for 'r-dcm' Packages // Many packages in
		the 'r-dcm' family take similar arguments, which are checked
		for expected structures and values. Rather than duplicating
		code across several packages, commonly used check functions are
		included here.  This package can then be imported to access the
		check functions in other packages.
