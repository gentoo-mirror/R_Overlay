		Nonlinear Regression using Horseshoe Prior // Provides the
		posterior estimates of the regression coefficients when
		horseshoe prior is specified. The regression models considered
		here are logistic model for binary response and log normal
		accelerated failure time model for right censored survival
		response. The linear model analysis is also available for
		completeness. All models provide deviance information criterion
		and widely applicable information criterion. See
