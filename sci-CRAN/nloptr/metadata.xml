		R Interface to NLopt // Solve optimization problems using an R
		interface to NLopt. NLopt is a free/open-source library for
		nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for a
		number of different free optimization routines available online
		as well as original implementations of various other
		algorithms. See
		https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/ for
		more information on the available algorithms. Building from
		included sources requires 'CMake'. On Linux and 'macOS', if a
		suitable system build of NLopt (2.7.0 or later) is found, it is
		used; otherwise, it is built from included sources via 'CMake'.
		On Windows, NLopt is obtained through 'rwinlib' for 'R = 4.1.x'
		or grabbed from the 'Rtools42 toolchain' for 'R = 4.2.0'.
