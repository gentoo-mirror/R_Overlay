		R Interface to NLopt // Solve optimization problems using an R
		interface to NLopt. NLopt is a free/open-source library for
		nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for a
		number of different free optimization routines available online
		as well as original implementations of various other
		algorithms. See http://ab-
		initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction for more
		information on the available algorithms. During installation of
		nloptr on Unix-based systems, the installer checks whether the
		NLopt library is installed on the system. If the NLopt library
		cannot be found, the code is compiled using the NLopt source
		included in the nloptr package.
