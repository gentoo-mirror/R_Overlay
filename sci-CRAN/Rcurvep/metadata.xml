		Concentration-Response Data Analysis using Curvep // Provide an R
		interface for processing concentration-response datasets using
		Curvep, a response noise filtering algorithm. The algorithm was
		described in the publications (Sedykh A et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1289/ehp.1002476 and Sedykh A (2016)
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-6346-1_14). Other parametric fitting
		approaches (e.g., Hill equation) are also adopted for ease of
		comparison. Also, methods for calculating the confidence
		interval around the activity metrics are also provided. The
		methods are based on the bootstrap approach to simulate the
		datasets (Hsieh J-H et al. doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfy258). The
		simulated datasets can be used to derive the baseline noise
		threshold in an assay endpoint. This threshold is critical in
		the toxicological studies to derive the point-of-departure
		(POD).
