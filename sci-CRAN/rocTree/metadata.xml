		Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-Guided Classification and
		Survival Tree // Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-guided
		survival trees and forests algorithms are implemented,
		providing a unified framework for tree-structured analysis with
		censored survival outcomes. A time-invariant partition scheme
		on the survivor population was considered to incorporate time-
		dependent covariates. Motivated by ideas of randomized tests,
		generalized time-dependent ROC curves were used to evaluate the
		performance of survival trees and establish the optimality of
		the target hazard function. The optimality of the target hazard
		function motivates us to use a weighted average of the time-
		dependent area under the curve (AUC) on a set of time points to
		evaluate the prediction performance of survival trees and to
		guide splitting and pruning. A detailed description of the
		implemented methods can be found in Sun et al. (2019)
		arXiv:1809.05627.
