		Accessing Environmental Data from ERD's ERDDAP Server // Contains
		three functions that access environmental data from ERD's
		ERDDAP service http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap. The
		xtracto() function extracts data along a trajectory for a given
		"radius" around the point. The xtracto_3D() function extracts
		data in a box. The xtractogon() function extracts data in a
		polygon. There are also two helper functions to obtain
		information about available data, and plotting functions to
		plot the results.
