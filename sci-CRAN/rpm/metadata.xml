		Modeling of Revealed Preferences Matchings // Statistical
		estimation of revealed preference models from data collected on
		bipartite matchings. The models are for matchings within a
		bipartite population where individuals have utility for people
		based on known and unknown characteristics. People can form a
		partnership or remain unpartnered. The model represents both
		the availability of potential partners of different types and
		preferences of individuals for such people. The software
		estimates preference parameters based on sample survey data on
		partnerships and population composition. The simulation of
		matchings and goodness-of-fit are considered.  See Goyal,
