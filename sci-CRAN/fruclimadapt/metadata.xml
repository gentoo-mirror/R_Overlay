		Evaluation Tools for Assessing Climate Adaptation of Fruit Tree
		Species // Climate is a critical component limiting growing
		range of plant species, which also determines cultivar
		adaptation to a region. The evaluation of climate influence on
		fruit production is critical for decision-making in the design
		stage of orchards and vineyards and in the evaluation of the
		potential consequences of future climate. Bio- climatic indices
		and plant phenology are commonly used to describe the
		suitability of climate for growing quality fruit and to provide
		temporal and spatial information about regarding ongoing and
		future changes. 'fruclimadapt' streamlines the assessment of
		climate adaptation and the identification of potential risks
		for grapevines and fruit trees. Procedures in the package allow
		to i) downscale daily meteorological variables to hourly values
		(Forster et al (2016) doi:10.5194/gmd-9-2315-2016), ii)
		estimate chilling and forcing heat accumulation (Miranda et al
		(2019) https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/sites/agri-
		eip/files/fg30_mp5_phenology_critical_temperatures.pdf), iii)
		estimate plant phenology (Schwartz (2012)
		doi:10.1007/978-94-007-6925-0), iv) calculate bioclimatic
		indices to evaluate fruit tree and grapevine adaptation (e.g.
		Badr et al (2017) doi:10.3354/cr01532), v) estimate the
		incidence of weather-related disorders in fruits (e.g. Snyder
		and de Melo-Abreu (2005, ISBN:92-5-105328-6) and vi) estimate
		plant water requirements (Allen et al (1998,
		ISBN:92-5-104219-5)).
