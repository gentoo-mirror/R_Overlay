		Students' Performance Dataset in Physics Education Research
		(SPHERE) // A multidimensional dataset of students' performance
		assessment in high school physics. The SPHERE dataset was
		collected from 497 students in four public high schools
		specifically measuring their conceptual understanding,
		scientific ability, and attitude toward physics from Santoso et
		al. (2024) doi:10.17632/88d7m2fv7p.1. The data collection was
		conducted using some research based assessments (RBAs)
		developed by the physics education research (PER) community.
		They include the Force Concept Inventory, the Force and Motion
		Conceptual Evaluation, the Rotational and Rolling Motion
		Conceptual Survey, the Fluid Mechanics Concept Inventory, the
		Mechanical Waves Conceptual Survey, the Thermal Concept
		Evaluation, the Survey of Thermodynamic Processes and First and
		Second Laws, the Scientific Abilities Assessment Rubrics, and
		the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey. Students'
		attributes related to gender, age, socioeconomic status,
		domicile, literacy, physics identity, and test results
		administered using teachers' developed items are also reported
		in this dataset.
