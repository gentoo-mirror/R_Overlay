		Archetypes for Targets // Function-oriented Make-like declarative
		workflows for Statistics and data science are supported in the
		'targets' R package. As an extension to 'targets', the
		'tarchetypes' package provides convenient user-side functions
		to make 'targets' easier to use. By establishing reusable
		archetypes for common kinds of targets and pipelines, these
		functions help express complicated reproducible workflows
		concisely and compactly. The methods in this package were
		influenced by the 'drake' R package by Will Landau (2018)
