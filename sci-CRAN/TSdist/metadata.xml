		Distance Measures for Time Series Data // A set of commonly used
		distance measures and some additional functions which, although
		initially not designed for this purpose, can be used to measure
		the dissimilarity between time series. These measures can be
		used to perform clustering, classification or other data mining
		tasks which require the definition of a distance measure
		between time series. U. Mori, A. Mendiburu and J.A. Lozano
