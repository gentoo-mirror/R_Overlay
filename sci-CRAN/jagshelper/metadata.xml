		Extracting and Visualizing Output from 'jagsUI' // Tools are
		provided to streamline Bayesian analyses in 'JAGS' using the
		'jagsUI' package.  Included are functions for extracting output
		in simpler format, functions for streamlining assessment of
		convergence, and functions for producing summary plots of
		output.  Also included is a function that provides a simple
		template for running 'JAGS' from 'R'. Referenced materials can
