		Multi-Reader, Multi-Case Analysis Methods (ROC, Agreement, and
		Other Metrics) // This software does Multi-Reader, Multi-Case
		(MRMC) analyses of data from imaging studies where clinicians
		(readers) evaluate patient images (cases). What does this mean?
		... Many imaging studies are designed so that every reader
		reads every case in all modalities, a fully-crossed study. In
		this case, the data is cross-correlated, and we consider the
		readers and cases to be cross-correlated random effects. An
		MRMC analysis accounts for the variability and correlations
		from the readers and cases when estimating variances,
		confidence intervals, and p-values. The functions in this
		package can treat arbitrary study designs and studies with
		missing data, not just fully-crossed study designs. An overview
		of this software, including references presenting details on
		the methods, can be found here: https://www.fda.gov/medical-
		devices/science-and-research-medical-devices/imrmc-software-do-
		multi-reader-multi-case-statistical-analysis-reader-studies.
