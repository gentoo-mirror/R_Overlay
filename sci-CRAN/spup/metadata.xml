		Uncertainty Propagation Analysis // Uncertainty propagation
		analysis in spatial environmental  modelling following
		methodology described in Heuvelink et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1080/13658810601063951 and Brown and Heuvelink (2007)
		doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2006.06.015. The package provides functions
		for examining the uncertainty propagation starting from input
		data and model parameters, via the environmental model onto
		model outputs. The functions include uncertainty model
		specification, stochastic simulation and propagation of
		uncertainty using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. Uncertain
		variables are described by probability distributions. Both
		numerical and categorical data types are handled. Spatial auto-
		correlation within an attribute and cross-correlation between
		attributes is accommodated for. The MC realizations may be used
		as input to the environmental models called from R, or
		externally.
