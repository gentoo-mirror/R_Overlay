		Implementation of Plots from Cleveland's Visualizing Data Book //
		William S. Cleveland's book 'Visualizing Data' is a classic
		piece of literature on Exploratory Data Analysis. Although it
		was written several decades ago, its content is still relevant
		as it proposes several tools which are useful to discover
		patterns and relationships among the data under study, and also
		to assess the goodness of fit o a model.  This package provides
		functions to produce the 'ggplot2' versions of the
		visualization tools described in this book and is thought to be
		used in the context of courses on Exploratory Data Analysis.
