		Visualizing Data using a 3D Printer // Converts data to STL
		(stereolithography) files that can be used to feed a
		3-dimensional printer.  The 3-dimensional output from a
		function can be materialized into a solid surface in a plastic
		material, therefore allowing more detailed examination. There
		are many possible uses for this new tool, such as to examine
		mathematical expressions with very irregular shapes, to aid
		teaching people with impaired vision, to create raised relief
		maps from digital elevation maps (DEMs), to bridge the gap
		between mathematical tools and rapid prototyping, and many
		more.  Ian Walker created the function r2stl() and Jose' Gama
		assembled the package.
