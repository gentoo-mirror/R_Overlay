		Estimation and Simulation of Trawl Processes // Contains R
		functions for simulating and estimating integer-valued trawl
		processes as described in the article "Modelling, simulation
		and inference for multivariate time series of counts using
		trawl processes" by A. E. D. Veraart (Journal of Multivariate
		Analysis, 2018, to appear, preprint available at:
		https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3100076 )
		and for simulating random vectors from the bivariate negative
		binomial and the bi- and trivariate logarithmic series
		distributions.
