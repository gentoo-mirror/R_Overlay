		Combining Mixture Components for Clustering // The Rmixmod
		package provides model-based clustering by fitting a mixture
		model (e.g. Gaussian components for quantitative continuous
		data) to the data and identifying each cluster with one of its
		components. The number of components can be determined from the
		data, typically using the BIC criterion. In practice, however,
		individual clusters can be poorly fitted by Gaussian
		distributions, and in that case model-based clustering tends to
		represent one non-Gaussian cluster by a mixture of two or more
		Gaussian components. If the number of mixture components is
		interpreted as the number of clusters, this can lead to
		overestimation of the number of clusters. This is because BIC
		selects the number of mixture components needed to provide a
		good approximation to the density. This package, RmixmodCombi,
		according to \emph{Combining Mixture Components for Clustering}
		by J.P. Baudry, A.E. Raftery, G. Celeux, K. Lo, R. Gottardo,
		combines the components of the EM/BIC solution (provided by
		Rmixmod) hierarchically according to an entropy criterion. This
		yields a clustering for each number of clusters less than or
		equal to K. These clusterings can be compared on substantive
		grounds, and we also provide a way of selecting the number of
		clusters via a piecewise linear regression fit to the (possibly
		rescaled) entropy plot.
