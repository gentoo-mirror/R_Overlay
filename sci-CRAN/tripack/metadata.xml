		Triangulation of Irregularly Spaced Data // A constrained two-
		dimensional Delaunay triangulation package providing both
		triangulation and generation of voronoi mosaics of irregular
		spaced data. Please note that most of the functions are now
		also covered in package interp, which is a re-implementation
		from scratch under a free license based on a different
		triangulation algorithm.
