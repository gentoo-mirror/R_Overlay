		Detailed Distributional Decomposition // Implements the Oaxaca-
		Blinder decomposition method and generalizations of it that
		decompose differences in distributional statistics beyond the
		mean. The function ob_decompose() decomposes differences in the
		mean outcome between two groups into one part explained by
		different covariates (composition effect) and into another part
		due to differences in the way covariates are linked to the
		outcome variable (structure effect). The function further
		divides the two effects into the contribution of each covariate
		and allows for weighted doubly robust decompositions. For
		distributional statistics beyond the mean, the function
		performs the recentered influence function (RIF) decomposition
		proposed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2018). The function
		dfl_decompose() divides differences in distributional
		statistics into an composition effect and a structure effect
		using inverse probability weighting as introduced by DiNardo,
		Fortin, and Lemieux (1996). The function also allows to
		sequentially decompose the composition effect into the
		contribution of single covariates. References: Firpo, Sergio,
		Nicole M. Fortin, and Thomas Lemieux. (2018)
