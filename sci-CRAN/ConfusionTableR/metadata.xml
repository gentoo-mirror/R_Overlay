		Confusion Matrix Toolset // Takes the outputs of a 'caret'
		confusion matrix and allows for the quick conversion of these
		list items to lists. The intended usage is to allow the tool to
		work with the outputs of machine learning classification
		models. This tool works with classification problems for binary
		and multi-classification problems and allows for the record
		level conversion of the confusion matrix outputs. This is
		useful, as it allows quick conversion of these objects for
		storage in database systems and to track ML model performance
		over time. Traditionally, this approach has been used for
		highlighting model representation and feature slippage.
