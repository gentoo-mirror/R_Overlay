		Inhomogeneous Poisson Point Processes // Generates random numbers
		corresponding to the events on a Poisson point process with
		changing event rates. This includes the possibility to
		incorporate additional information such as the number of events
		occurring or the location of an already known event. It can
		also generate the probability density functions of specific
		events in the cases where additional information is available.
		Based on Hohmann (2019) arXiv:1901.10754.
