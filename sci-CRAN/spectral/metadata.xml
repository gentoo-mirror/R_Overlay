		Common Methods of Spectral Data Analysis // On discrete data
		spectral analysis is performed by Fourier and Hilbert
		transforms as well as with model based analysis called Lomb-
		Scargle method. Fragmented and irregularly spaced data can be
		processed in almost all methods. Both, FFT as well as LOMB
		methods take multivariate data and return standardized PSD. For
		didactic reasons an analytical approach for deconvolution of
		noise spectra and sampling function is provided. A user
		friendly interface helps to interpret the results.
