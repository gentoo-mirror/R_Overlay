		Interpreting CoDa Regression Models // Provides methods for
		interpreting CoDa (Compositional Data) regression models along
		the lines of "Pairwise share ratio interpretations of
		compositional regression models" (Dargel and Thomas-Agnan 2024)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2024.107945. The new methods include
		variation scenarios, elasticities, elasticity differences and
		share ratio elasticities. These tools are independent of log-
		ratio transformations and allow an interpretation in the
		original space of shares. 'CoDaImpact' is designed to be used
		with the 'compositions' package and its ecosystem.
