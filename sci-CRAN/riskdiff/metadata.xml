		Robust Risk Difference Estimation with Multiple Link Functions //
		Calculates risk differences (or prevalence differences for
		cross-sectional data) using generalized linear models with
		automatic link function selection. Provides robust model
		fitting with fallback methods, support for stratification and
		adjustment variables, and publication-ready output formatting.
		Handles model convergence issues gracefully and provides
		confidence intervals using multiple approaches. Methods are
		based on approaches described in Mark W. Donoghoe and Ian C.
		Marschner (2018) "logbin: An R Package for Relative Risk
		Regression Using the Log-Binomial Model"
		doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i09 for robust GLM fitting, and standard
		epidemiological methods for risk difference estimation as
		described in Kenneth J. Rothman, Sander Greenland and Timothy
		L. Lash (2008, ISBN:9780781755641) "Modern Epidemiology".
