		Risk Difference Estimation with Multiple Link Functions //
		Calculates risk differences (or prevalence differences for
		cross-sectional data) using generalized linear models with
		automatic link function selection. Provides robust model
		fitting with fallback methods, support for stratification and
		adjustment variables, inverse probability of treatment
		weighting (IPTW) for causal inference, and publication-ready
		output formatting. Handles model convergence issues gracefully
		and provides confidence intervals using multiple approaches.
		Methods are based on approaches described in Mark W. Donoghoe
		and Ian C. Marschner (2018) "logbin: An R Package for Relative
		Risk Regression Using the Log-Binomial Model"
		doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i09 for robust GLM fitting, Peter C.
		Austin (2011) "An Introduction to Propensity Score Methods for
		Reducing the Effects of Confounding in Observational Studies"
		doi:10.1080/00273171.2011.568786 for IPTW methods, and standard
		epidemiological methods for risk difference estimation as
		described in Kenneth J. Rothman, Sander Greenland and Timothy
		L. Lash (2008, ISBN:9780781755641) "Modern Epidemiology".
