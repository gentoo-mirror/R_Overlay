		Monte Carlo Simulation for Surface Backscattering // Monte Carlo
		simulation is a stochastic method computing trajectories of
		photons in media. Surface backscattering is performing
		calculations in semi-infinite media and summarizing photon flux
		leaving the surface. This simulation is modeling the optical
		measurement of diffuse reflectance using an incident light
		beam. The semi-infinite media is considered to have flat
		surface. Media, typically biological tissue, is described by
		four optical parameters: absorption coefficient, scattering
		coefficient, anisotropy factor, refractive index. The media is
		assumed to be homogeneous. Computational parameters of the
		simulation include: number of photons, radius of incident light
		beam, lowest photon energy threshold, intensity profile (halo)
		radius, spatial resolution of intensity profile. You can find
		more information and validation in the Open Access paper.
