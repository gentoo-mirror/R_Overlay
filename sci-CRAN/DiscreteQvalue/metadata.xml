		Improved q-Values for Discrete Uniform and Homogeneous Tests //
		We consider a multiple testing procedure used in many modern
		applications which is the q-value method proposed by Storey and
		Tibshirani (2003), doi:10.1073/pnas.1530509100. The q-value
		method is based on the false discovery rate (FDR), hence
		versions of the q-value method can be defined depending on
		which estimator of the proportion of true null hypotheses, p0,
		is plugged in the FDR estimator. We implement the q-value
		method based on two classical pi0 estimators, and furthermore,
		we propose and implement three versions of the q-value method
		for homogeneous discrete uniform P-values based on pi0
		estimators which take into account the discrete distribution of
		the P-values.
