		Automate the Delineation of Urban River Spaces // Provides tools
		to automate the morphological delineation of riverside urban
		areas, based on a method introduced in Forgaci (2018)
		doi:10.7480/abe.2018.31. Delineation entails the identification
		of corridor boundaries, segmentation of the corridor, and
		delineation of the river space. The resulting delineation can
		be used to characterise spatial phenomena that can be related
		to the river as a central element.
