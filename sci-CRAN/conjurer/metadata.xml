		A Parametric Method for Generating Synthetic Data // Generates
		synthetic data distributions to enable testing various
		modelling techniques in ways that real data does not allow.
		Noise can be added in a controlled manner such that the data
		seems real. This methodology is generic and therefore benefits
		both the academic and industrial research.
