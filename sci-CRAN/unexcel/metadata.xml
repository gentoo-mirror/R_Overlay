		Revert Excel Serial Dates Back to Intended Day.Month Numerics //
		Detects values imported from spreadsheets that were auto-
		converted to Excel date serials and reconstructs the originally
		intended day.month decimals (for example, '30.3' that Excel
		displayed as '30/03/2025'). The functions work in a vectorized
		manner, preserve non-serial values, and support both the 1900
		and 1904 date systems.
