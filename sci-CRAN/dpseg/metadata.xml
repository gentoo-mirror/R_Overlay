		Piecewise Linear Segmentation by Dynamic Programming // Piecewise
		linear segmentation of ordered data by a dynamic programming
		algorithm. The algorithm was developed for time series data,
		e.g. growth curves, and for genome-wide read-count data from
		next generation sequencing, but is broadly applicable. Generic
		implementations of dynamic programming routines allow to scan
		for optimal segmentation parameters and test custom
		segmentation criteria ("scoring functions").
