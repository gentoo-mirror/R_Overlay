		Bayesian Meta-Analysis and Network Meta-Analysis // Contains
		functions performing Bayesian inference for meta-analytic and
		network meta-analytic models through Markov chain Monte Carlo
		algorithm. Currently, the package implements Yao, Kim, Chen,
		Ibrahim, Shah, and Jianxin Lin (2015)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1006065 and network meta-regression
		models using heavy-tailed multivariate random effects with
		covariate-dependent variances. For maximal computational
		efficiency, the Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for each
		model, written in C++, are fine-tuned. This software has been
		developed under the auspices of the National Institutes of
		Health and Merck  Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.
