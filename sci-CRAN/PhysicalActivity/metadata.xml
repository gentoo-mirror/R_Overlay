		Process Accelerometer Data for Physical Activity Measurement //
		It provides a function "wearingMarking" for classification of
		monitor wear and nonwear time intervals in accelerometer data
		collected to assess physical activity. The package also
		contains functions for making plot for accelerometer data and
		obtaining the summary of various information including daily
		monitor wear time and the mean monitor wear time during valid
		days. "deliveryPred" and "markDelivery" can classify days for
		ActiGraph delivery by mail; "deliveryPreprocess" can process
		accelerometry data for analysis by zeropadding incomplete days
		and removing low activity days; "markPAI" can categorize
		physical activity intensity level based on user-defined cut-
		points of accelerometer counts. It also supports importing
		ActiGraph AGD files with "readActigraph" and "queryActigraph"
		functions.
