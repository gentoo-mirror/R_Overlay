		Local Individual Conditional Expectation // Local Individual
		Conditional Expectation is as an extension to Individual
		Conditional Expectation (ICE) and provides three-dimensional
		local explanations for particular data instances. The three
		dimension are two features at the horizontal and vertical axes
		as well as the target that is represented by different colors.
		The approach is applicable for classification and regression
		problems to explain interactions of two features towards the
		target. The plot for discrete targets looks similar to plots of
		cluster algorithms like k-means, where different clusters
		represent different predictions. Reference to the ICE approach:
