		Local Individual Conditional Expectation // Local Individual
		Conditional Expectation ('localICE') is a local explanation
		approach from the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence
		(XAI). localICE is a model-agnostic XAI approach which provides
		three-dimensional local explanations for particular data
		instances. The approach is proposed in the master thesis of
		Martin Walter as an extension to ICE (see Reference). The three
		dimensions are the two features at the horizontal and vertical
		axes as well as the target represented by different colors. The
		approach is applicable for classification and regression
		problems to explain interactions of two features towards the
		target. For classification models, the number of classes can be
		more than two and each class is added as a different color to
		the plot. The given instance is added to the plot as two dotted
		lines according to the feature values. The localICE-package can
		explain features of type factor and numeric of any machine
		learning model. Automatically supported machine learning
		packages are 'mlr', 'randomForest', 'caret' or all other with
		an S3 predict function. For further model types from other
		libraries, a predict function has to be provided as an argument
		in order to get access to the model. Reference to the ICE
		approach: Alex Goldstein, Adam Kapelner, Justin Bleich, Emil
		Pitkin (2013) arXiv:1309.6392.
