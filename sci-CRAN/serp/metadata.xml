		Smooth Effects on Response Penalty for 'CLM' // A regularization
		method for the cumulative link models.  The 'smooth-effect-on-
		response penalty' ('SERP') provides flexible modelling of the
		ordinal model by enabling the smooth transition from the
		general cumulative link model to a coarser form of the same
		model. In other words, as the tuning parameter goes from zero
		to infinity, the subject-specific effects associated with each
		variable in the model tend to a unique global effect. The
		parameter estimates of the general cumulative model are mostly
		unidentifiable or at least only identifiable within a range of
		the entire parameter space. Thus, by maximizing a penalized
		rather than the usual non-penalized log-likelihood, this and
		other numerical problems common with the general model are to a
		large extent eliminated. Fitting is via a modified Newton's
		method. Several standard model performance and descriptive
		methods are also available. An outline of the penalty
		implemented here is found in Tutz, G and Gertheiss, J (2016)
