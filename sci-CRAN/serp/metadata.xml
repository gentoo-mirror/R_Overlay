		Smooth Effects on Response Penalty for CLM // Implements a
		regularization method for cumulative link models using the
		Smooth-Effect-on-Response Penalty (SERP). This method allows
		flexible modeling of ordinal data by enabling a smooth
		transition from a general cumulative link model to a simplified
		version of the same model. As the tuning parameter increases
		from zero to infinity, the subject-specific effects for each
		variable converge to a single global effect. The approach
		addresses common issues in cumulative link models, such as
		parameter unidentifiability and numerical instability, by
		maximizing a penalized log-likelihood instead of the standard
		non-penalized version. Fitting is performed using a modified
		Newton's method. Additionally, the package includes various
		model performance metrics and descriptive tools. For details on
		the implemented penalty method, see Ugba (2021)
		doi:10.21105/joss.03705 and Ugba et al. (2021)
		doi:10.3390/stats4030037.
