		Smooth Effects on Response Penalty for 'CLM' // A regularization
		method for the cumulative link models.  The 'smooth-effect-on-
		response penalty' ('SERP') provides flexible modelling of the
		ordinal model by enabling the smooth transition from the
		general cumulative link model to a coarser form of the same
		model. In other words, as the tuning parameter goes from zero
		to infinity, the subject-specific effects associated with each
		variable in the model tend to a unique global effect. The
		parameter estimates of the general cumulative model are mostly
		unidentifiable or at least only identifiable within a range of
		the entire parameter space. Thus, by maximizing a penalized
		rather than the usual non-penalized log-likelihood, this and
		other numerical problems common with the general model are to a
		large extent eliminated. Fitting is via a modified Newton's
		method. Several standard model performance and descriptive
		methods are also available. For more details on the penalty
		implemented here, see, 'Ugba (2021)' doi:10.21105/joss.03705,
		'Ugba et al. (2021)' doi:10.3390/stats4030037 and 'Tutz and
		Gertheiss (2016)' doi:10.1177/1471082X16642560.
