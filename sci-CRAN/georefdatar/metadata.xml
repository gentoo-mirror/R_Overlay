		Geosciences Reference Datasets // Reference datasets commonly
		used in the geosciences. These include standard atomic weights
		of the elements, a periodic table, a list of minerals including
		their abbreviations and chemistry, geochemical data of
		reservoirs (primitive mantle, continental crust, mantle,
		basalts, etc.), decay constants and isotopic ratios frequently
		used in geochronology, color codes of the chronostratigraphic
		chart. In addition, the package provides functions for basic
		queries of atomic weights, the list of minerals, and
		chronostratigraphic chart colors. All datasets are fully
		referenced, and a BibTeX file containing the references is
		included.
