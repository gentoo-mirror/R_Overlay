		A Time-Travelling Debugger // Uses provenance post-execution to
		help the user understand and debug their script by providing
		functions to look at intermediate steps and data values, their
		forwards and backwards lineage, and to understand the steps
		leading up to warning and error messages. 'provDebugR' uses
		provenance produced by 'rdtLite' (available on CRAN), stored in
		PROV-JSON format.
