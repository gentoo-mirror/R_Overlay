		Accessing Statistics Canada Data Table and Vectors // Searches
		for, accesses, and retrieves Statistics Canada data tables, as
		well as individual vectors, as tidy data frames. This package
		enriches the tables with metadata, deals with encoding issues,
		allows for bilingual English or French language data retrieval,
		and bundles convenience functions to make it easier to work
		with retrieved table data. For more efficient data access the
		package allows for caching data in a local database and
		database level filtering, data manipulation and summarizing.
