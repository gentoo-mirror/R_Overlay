		Animal Dominance Hierarchies by Elo Rating // Provides functions
		to quantify animal dominance hierarchies. The major focus is on
		Elo rating and its ability to deal with temporal dynamics in
		dominance interaction sequences. For static data, David's score
		and de Vries' ISI are also implemented. In addition, the
		package provides functions to assess transitivity, linearity
		and stability of dominance networks. See Neumann et al (2011)
		doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.07.016 for an introduction.
