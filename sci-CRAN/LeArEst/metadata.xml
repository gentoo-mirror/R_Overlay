		Border and Area Estimation of Data Measured with Additive Error
		// Provides methods for estimating borders of uniform
		distribution on the interval (one-dimensional) and on the
		elliptical domain (two-dimensional) under measurement errors.
		For one-dimensional case, it also estimates the length of
		underlying uniform domain and tests the hypothesized length
		against two-sided or one-sided alternatives. For two-
		dimensional case, it estimates the area of underlying uniform
		domain. It works with numerical inputs as well as with pictures
		in JPG format.
