		Smoothing Long-Memory Time Series // The nonparametric trend and
		its derivatives in equidistant time series (TS) with long-
		memory errors can be estimated. The estimation is conducted via
		local polynomial regression using an automatically selected
		bandwidth obtained by a built-in iterative plug-in algorithm or
		a bandwidth fixed by the user. The smoothing methods of the
		package are described in Letmathe, S., Beran, J. and Feng, Y.,
		(2023) doi:10.1080/03610926.2023.2276049.
