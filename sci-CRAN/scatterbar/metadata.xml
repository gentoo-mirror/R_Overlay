		Scattered Stacked Bar Chart Plots // Provides a powerful and
		flexible tool for visualizing proportional data across
		spatially resolved contexts. By combining the concepts of
		scatter plots and stacked bar charts, 'scatterbar' allows users
		to create scattered bar chart plots, which effectively display
		the proportions of different categories at each (x, y)
		location. This visualization is particularly useful for
		applications where understanding the distribution of categories
		across spatial coordinates is essential. This package features
		automatic determination of optimal scaling factors based on
		data, customizable scaling and padding options for both x and y
		axes, flexibility to specify custom colors for each category,
		options to customize the legend title, and integration with
		'ggplot2' for robust and high-quality visualizations. For more
		details, see Velazquez et al. (2024)
