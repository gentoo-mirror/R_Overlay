		Machine Learning and Mapping for Spatial Epidemiology // Provides
		tools for the integration, visualisation, and modelling of
		spatial epidemiological data using the method described in
		Azeez, A.,  Noel, C. (2025). 'Predictive Modelling and Spatial
		Distribution of Pancreatic Cancer in Africa Using Machine
		Learning-Based Spatial Model' doi:10.5281/zenodo.16529986 and
		doi:10.5281/zenodo.16529016. It facilitates the analysis of
		geographic health data by combining modern spatial mapping
		tools with advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms.
		'mlspatial' enables users to import and pre-process shapefile
		and associated demographic or disease incidence data, generate
		richly annotated thematic maps, and apply predictive models,
		including Random Forest, 'XGBoost', and Support Vector
		Regression, to identify spatial patterns and risk factors. It
		is suited for spatial epidemiologists, public health
		researchers, and GIS analysts aiming to uncover hidden
		geographic patterns in health-related outcomes and inform
		evidence-based interventions.
