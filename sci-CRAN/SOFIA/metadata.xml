		Making Sophisticated and Aesthetical Figures in R // Software
		that leverages the capabilities of Circos by manipulating data,
		preparing configuration files, and running the Perl-native
		Circos directly from the R environment with minimal user
		intervention. Circos is a novel software that addresses the
		challenges in visualizing genetic data by creating circular
		ideograms composed of tracks of heatmaps, scatter plots, line
		plots, histograms, links between common markers, glyphs, text,
		and etc. Please see http://www.circos.ca.
