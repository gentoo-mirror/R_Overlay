		Explore Temporal Signal of Molecular Phylogenies // Sequences
		sampled at different time points can be used to infer molecular
		phylogenies on natural time scales, but if the sequences
		records inaccurate sampling times, that are not the actual
		sampling times, then it will affect the molecular phylogenetic
		analysis. This shiny application helps exploring temporal
		characteristics of the evolutionary trees through linear
		regression analysis and with the ability to identify and remove
		incorrect labels.
