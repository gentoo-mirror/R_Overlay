		Self-Organizing Maps with Built-in Missing Data Imputation // The
		Self-Organizing Maps with Built-in Missing Data Imputation.
		Missing values are imputed and regularly updated during the
		online Kohonen algorithm. Our method can be used for data
		visualisation, clustering or imputation of missing data. It is
		an extension of the online algorithm of the 'kohonen' package.
		The method is described in the article "Self-Organizing Maps
		for Exploration of Partially Observed Data and Imputation of
		Missing Values" by S. Rejeb, C. Duveau, T. Rebafka (2022)
