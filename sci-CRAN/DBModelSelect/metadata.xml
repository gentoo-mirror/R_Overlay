		Distribution-Based Model Selection // Perform model selection
		using distribution and probability-based methods, including
		standardized AIC, BIC, and AICc. These standardized information
		criteria allow one to perform model selection in a way similar
		to the prevalent "Rule of 2" method, but formalize the method
		to rely on probability theory. A novel goodness-of-fit
		procedure for assessing linear regression models is also
		available. This test relies on theoretical properties of the
		estimated error variance for a normal linear regression model,
		and employs a bootstrap procedure to assess the null hypothesis
		that the fitted model shows no lack of fit. For more
		information, see Koeneman and Cavanaugh (2023)
		arXiv:2309.10614. Functionality to perform all subsets linear
		or generalized linear regression is also available.
