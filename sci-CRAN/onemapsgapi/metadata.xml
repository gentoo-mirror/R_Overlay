		R Wrapper for the 'OneMap.Sg API' // An R wrapper for the
		'OneMap.Sg' API https://docs.onemap.sg/. Functions help users
		query data from the API and return raw JSON data in "tidy"
		formats. Support is also available for users to retrieve data
		from multiple API calls and integrate results into single
		dataframes, without needing to clean and merge the data
		themselves. This package is best suited for users who would
		like to perform analyses with Singapore's spatial data without
		having to perform excessive data cleaning.
