		Regression Coefficients Estimation Using the Generalized Cross
		Entropy // Estimation and inference using the Generalized
		Maximum Entropy (GME) and Generalized Cross Entropy (GCE)
		framework, a flexible method for solving ill-posed inverse
		problems and parameter estimation under uncertainty (Golan,
		Judge, and Miller (1996, ISBN:978-0471145925) "Maximum Entropy
		Econometrics: Robust Estimation with Limited Data"). The
		package includes routines for generalized cross entropy
		estimation of linear models including the implementation of a
		GME-GCE two steps approach. Diagnostic tools, and options to
		incorporate prior information through support and prior
		distributions are available (Macedo, Cabral, Afreixo, Macedo
		and Angelelli (2025) doi:10.1007/978-3-031-97589-9_21). In
		particular, support spaces can be defined by the user or be
		internally computed based on the ridge trace or on the
		distribution of standardized regression coefficients. Different
		optimization methods for the objective function can be used. An
		adaptation of the normalized entropy aggregation (Macedo and
		Costa (2019) doi:10.1007/978-3-030-26036-1_2 "Normalized
		entropy aggregation for inhomogeneous large-scale data") and a
		two-stage maximum entropy approach for time series regression
		(Macedo (2022) doi:10.1080/03610918.2022.2057540) are also
		available. Suitable for applications in econometrics, health,
		signal processing, and other fields requiring robust estimation
		under data constraints.
