		Epistemic Network Analysis // ENA (Shaffer, D. W. (2017)
		Quantitative Ethnography. ISBN: 0578191687) is a method used to
		identify meaningful and quantifiable patterns in discourse or
		reasoning. ENA moves beyond the traditional frequency-based
		assessments by examining the structure of the co-occurrence, or
		connections in coded data. Moreover, compared to other
		methodological approaches, ENA has the novelty of (1) modeling
		whole networks of connections and (2) affording both
		quantitative and qualitative comparisons between different
		network models.   Shaffer, D.W., Collier, W.,  Ruis, A.R.
