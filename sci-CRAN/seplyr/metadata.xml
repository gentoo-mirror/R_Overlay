		Standard Evaluation Interfaces for Common 'dplyr' Tasks // The
		'seplyr' (standard evaluation data.frame 'dplyr') package
		supplies standard evaluation adapter methods for important
		common 'dplyr' methods that currently have a non-standard
		programming interface. This allows the analyst to use 'dplyr'
		to perform fundamental data transformation steps such as
		arranging rows, grouping rows, aggregating selecting columns
		without having to use learn the details of 'rlang'/'tidyeval'
		non-standard evaluation and without continuing to rely on now
		deprecated 'dplyr' "underscore verbs." In addition the 'seplyr'
		package supplies several new "key operations bound together"
		methods.  These include 'group_summarize()' (which combines
		grouping, arranging and calculation in an atomic unit),
		'add_group_summaries()' (which joins grouped summaries into a
		'data.frame' in a well documented manner), and
		'add_group_indices()' (which adds per-group identifies to a
		'data.frame' without depending on row-order).
