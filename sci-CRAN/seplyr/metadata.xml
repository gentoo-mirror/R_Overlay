		Standard Evaluation Improved Interfaces for Common Data
		Manipulation Tasks // The 'seplyr' (standard evaluation
		'dplyr') package supplies improved standard evaluation adapter
		methods for important common data manipulation tasks. In
		addition the 'seplyr' package supplies several new "key
		operations bound together" methods.  These include
		'group_summarize()' (which combines grouping, arranging and
		calculation in an atomic unit), 'add_group_summaries()' (which
		joins grouped summaries into a 'data.frame' in a well
		documented manner), 'add_group_indices()' (which adds per-group
		identifiers to a 'data.frame' without depending on row-order),
		'partition_mutate_qt()' (which optimizes mutate sequences), and
		'if_else_device()' (which simulates per-row if-else blocks in
		expression sequences).
