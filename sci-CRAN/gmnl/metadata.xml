		Multinomial Logit Models with Random Parameters // An
		implementation of maximum simulated likelihood method for the
		estimation of multinomial logit models with random
		coefficients. Specifically, it allows estimating models with
		continuous heterogeneity such as the mixed multinomial logit
		and the generalized multinomial logit. It also allows
		estimating models with discrete heterogeneity such as the
		latent class and the mixed-mixed multinomial logit model.
