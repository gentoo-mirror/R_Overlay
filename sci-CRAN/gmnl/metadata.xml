		Multinomial Logit Models with Random Parameters // An
		implementation of maximum simulated likelihood method for the
		estimation of multinomial logit models with random coefficients
		as presented by Sarrias and Daziano (2017)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i02. Specifically, it allows estimating
		models with continuous heterogeneity such as the mixed
		multinomial logit and the generalized multinomial logit. It
		also allows estimating models with discrete heterogeneity such
		as the latent class and the mixed-mixed multinomial logit
		model.
