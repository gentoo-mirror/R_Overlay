		Code Calibration in a Bayesian Framework // Calibration of every
		computational code. It uses a Bayesian framework to rule the
		estimation. With a new data set, the prediction will create a
		prevision set taking into account the new calibrated
		parameters. The choices between several models is also
		available. The methods are described in the paper Carmassi et
