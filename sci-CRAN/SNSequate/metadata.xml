		Standard and Nonstandard Statistical Models and Methods for Test
		Equating // Contains functions to perform various models and
		methods for test equating. It currently implements the
		traditional mean, linear and equipercentile equating methods.
		Both IRT observed-score and true-score equating are also
		supported, as well as the mean-mean, mean-sigma, Haebara and
		Stocking-Lord IRT linking methods. It also supports newest
		methods such that local equating, kernel equating (using
		Gaussian, logistic, Epanechnikov, uniform and adaptive kernels)
		with presmoothing, and IRT parameter linking methods based on
		asymmetric item characteristic functions. Functions to obtain
		both standard error of equating (SEE) and standard error of
		equating differences between two equating functions (SEED) are
		also implemented for the kernel method of equating.
