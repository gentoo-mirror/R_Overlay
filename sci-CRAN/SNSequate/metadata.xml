		Standard and Nonstandard Statistical Models and Methods for Test
		Equating // Contains functions to perform various models and
		methods for test equating (Kolen and Brennan, 2014
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-0317-7 ; Gonzalez and Wiberg, 2017
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-51824-4 ; von Davier et. al, 2004
		doi:10.1007/b97446). It currently implements the traditional
		mean, linear and equipercentile equating methods. Both IRT
		observed-score and true-score equating are also supported, as
		well as the mean-mean, mean-sigma, Haebara and Stocking-Lord
		IRT linking methods. It also supports newest methods such that
		local equating, kernel equating (using Gaussian, logistic,
		Epanechnikov, uniform and adaptive kernels) with presmoothing,
		and IRT parameter linking methods based on asymmetric item
		characteristic functions. Functions to obtain both standard
		error of equating (SEE) and standard error of equating
		differences between two equating functions (SEED) are also
		implemented for the kernel method of equating.
