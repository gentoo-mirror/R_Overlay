		Cox Regression with Firth's Penalized Likelihood // Implements
		Firth's penalized maximum likelihood bias reduction method  for
		Cox regression which has been shown to provide a solution in
		case of monotone likelihood (nonconvergence of likelihood
		function), see Heinze and Schemper (2001) and Heinze and
		Dunkler (2008). The program fits profile penalized likelihood
		confidence intervals which were proved to outperform Wald
		confidence intervals.
