		Leveraging Experiment Lines to Data Analytics // The natural
		increase in the complexity of current research experiments and
		data demands better tools to enhance productivity in Data
		Analytics. The package is a framework designed to address the
		modern challenges in data analytics workflows. The package is
		inspired by Experiment Line concepts. It aims to provide
		seamless support for users in developing their data mining
		workflows by offering a uniform data model and method API. It
		enables the integration of various data mining activities,
		including data preprocessing, classification, regression,
		clustering, and time series prediction. It also offers options
		for hyper-parameter tuning and supports integration with
		existing libraries and languages. Overall, the package provides
		researchers with a comprehensive set of functionalities for
		data science, promoting ease of use, extensibility, and
		integration with various tools and libraries. Information on
		Experiment Line is based on Ogasawara et al. (2009)
