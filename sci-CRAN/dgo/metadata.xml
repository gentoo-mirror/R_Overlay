		level item response theory (IRT) and multilevel regression and
		poststratification (MRP) models from item response data. dgo
		models latent traits at the level of demographic and geographic
		groups, rather than individuals, in a Bayesian group-level IRT
		approach developed by Caughey and Warshaw (2015)
