		Functions for Benchmarking Time Series Prediction // Functions
		for time series prediction and accuracy assessment using
		automatic linear modelling. The generated linear models and its
		yielded prediction errors can be used for benchmarking other
		time series prediction methods and for creating a demand for
		the refinement of such methods. For this purpose, benchmark
		data from prediction competitions may be used.
