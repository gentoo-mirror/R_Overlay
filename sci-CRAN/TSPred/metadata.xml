		Functions for Benchmarking Time Series Prediction // Functions
		for time series preprocessing, decomposition, prediction and
		accuracy assessment using automatic linear modelling. The
		generated linear models and its yielded prediction errors can
		be used for benchmarking other time series prediction methods
		and for creating a demand for the refinement of such methods.
		For this purpose, benchmark data from prediction competitions
		may be used.
