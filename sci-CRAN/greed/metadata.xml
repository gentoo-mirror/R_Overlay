		Clustering and Model Selection with the Integrated Classification
		Likelihood // An ensemble of algorithms that enable the
		clustering of networks and data matrices (such as counts,
		categorical or continuous) with different type of generative
		models. Model selection and clustering is performed in
		combination by optimizing the Integrated Classification
		Likelihood (which is equivalent to minimizing the description
		length). Several models are available such as: Stochastic Block
		Model, degree corrected Stochastic Block Model, Mixtures of
		Multinomial, Latent Block Model. The optimization is performed
		thanks to a combination of greedy local search and a genetic
		algorithm (see arXiv:2002:11577 for more details).
