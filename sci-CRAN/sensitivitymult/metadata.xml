		Sensitivity Analysis for Observational Studies with Multiple
		Outcomes // Sensitivity analysis for multiple outcomes in
		observational studies.  For instance, all linear combinations
		of several outcomes may be explored using Scheffe projections
		in the comparison() function; see Rosenbaum (2016, Annals of
		Applied Statistics) doi:10.1214/16-AOAS942.  Alternatively,
		attention may focus on a few principal components in the
		principal() function.  The package includes parallel methods
		for individual outcomes, including tests in the senm() function
		and confidence intervals in the senmCI() function.
