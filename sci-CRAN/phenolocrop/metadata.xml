		Time-Series Models to the Crop Phenology // Fit a time-series
		model to a crop phenology data, such as time-series rice canopy
		height. This package returns the model parameters as the
		summary statistics of crop phenology, and these parameters will
		be useful to characterize the growth pattern of each cultivar
		and predict manually-measured traits, such as days to heading
		and biomass. Please see Taniguchi et al. (2022)
		doi:10.3389/fpls.2022.998803 for detail. This package has been
		designed for scientific use. Use for commercial purposes shall
		not be allowed.
