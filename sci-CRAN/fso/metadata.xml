		Fuzzy Set Ordination // Fuzzy set ordination is a multivariate
		analysis used in ecology to relate the composition of samples
		to possible explanatory variables.  While differing in theory
		and method, in practice, the use is similar to 'constrained
		ordination.'  The package contains plotting and summary
		functions as well as the analyses.
