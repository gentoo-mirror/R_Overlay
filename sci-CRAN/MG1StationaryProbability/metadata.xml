		Computes Stationary Distribution for M/G/1 Queuing System // The
		idea of a computational algorithm described in the article by
		Andronov M. et al. (2022)
		https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-92507-9_13.
		The purpose of this package is to automate computations for a
		Markov-Modulated M/G/1 queuing system with alternating Poisson
		flow of arrivals. It offers a set of functions to calculate
		various mean indices of the system, including mean flow
		intensity, mean service busy and idle times, and the system's
		stationary probability.
