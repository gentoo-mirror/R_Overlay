		LInear Regression in Astronomy // Performs Bayesian linear
		regression and forecasting in astronomy. The method accounts
		for heteroscedastic errors in both the independent and the
		dependent variables, intrinsic scatters (in both variables) and
		scatter correlation, time evolution of slopes, normalization,
		scatters, Malmquist and Eddington bias, upper limits and break
		of linearity. The posterior distribution of the regression
		parameters is sampled with a Gibbs method exploiting the JAGS
		library.
