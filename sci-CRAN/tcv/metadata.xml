		Determining the Number of Factors in Poisson Factor Models via
		Thinning Cross-Validation // Implements methods for selecting
		the number of factors in Poisson factor models, with a primary
		focus on Thinning Cross-Validation (TCV). The TCV method is
		based on the 'data thinning' technique, which probabilistically
		partitions each count observation into training and test sets
		while preserving the underlying factor structure. The Poisson
		factor model is then fit on the training set, and model
		selection is performed by comparing predictive performance on
		the test set. This toolkit is designed for researchers working
		with high-dimensional count data in fields such as genomics,
		text mining, and social sciences. The data thinning methodology
		is detailed in Dharamshi et al. (2025)
