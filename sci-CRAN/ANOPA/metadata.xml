		Analyses of Proportions using Anscombe Transform // Analyses of
		Proportions can be performed on the Anscombe (arcsine-related)
		transformed data. The 'ANOPA' package can analyze proportions
		obtained from up to four factors. The factors can be within-
		subject or between-subject or a mix of within- and between-
		subject. The main, omnibus analysis can be followed by additive
		decompositions into interaction effects, main effects, simple
		effects, contrast effects, etc., mimicking precisely the logic
		of ANOVA. For that reason, we call this set of tools 'ANOPA'
		(Analysis of Proportion using Anscombe transform) to highlight
		its similarities with ANOVA. The 'ANOPA' framework also allows
		plots of proportions easy to obtain along with confidence
		intervals. Finally, effect sizes and planning statistical power
		are easily done under this framework. Only particularity, the
		'ANOPA' computes F statistics which have an infinite degree of
		freedom on the denominator. See Laurencelle and Cousineau
