		Optimum Contribution Selection and Population Genetics // A
		framework for the optimization of breeding programs via optimum
		contribution selection and mate allocation. An easy to use set
		of function for computation of optimum contributions of
		selection candidates, and of the population genetic parameters
		to be optimized. These parameters can be estimated using
		pedigree or genotype information, and include kinships,
		kinships at native haplotype segments, and breed composition of
		crossbred individuals. They are suitable for managing genetic
		diversity, removing introgressed genetic material, and
		accelerating genetic gain. Additionally, functions are provided
		for computing genetic contributions from ancestors, inbreeding
		coefficients, the native effective size, the native genome
		equivalent, pedigree completeness, and for preparing and
		plotting pedigrees.
