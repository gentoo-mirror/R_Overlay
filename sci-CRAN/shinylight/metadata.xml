		Web Interface to 'R' Functions // Web front end for your 'R'
		functions producing plots or tables. If you have a function or
		set of related functions, you can make them available over the
		internet through a web browser. This is the same motivation as
		the 'shiny' package, but note that the development of
		'shinylight' is not in any way linked to that of 'shiny'
		(beyond the use of the 'httpuv' package). You might prefer
		'shinylight' to 'shiny' if you want a lighter weight deployment
		with easier horizontal scaling, or if you want to develop your
		front end yourself in JavaScript and HTML just using a
		lightweight remote procedure call interface to your R code on
		the server.
