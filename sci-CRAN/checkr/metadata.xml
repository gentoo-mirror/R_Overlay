		Check the Properties of Common R Objects // Expressive assertive
		pipe-friendly functions to check the properties of common R
		objects. In the case of failure the functions issue informative
		error messages that (hopefully!) allow users to quickly
		identify and fix any problems. The functions are designed to be
		used in scripts and packages.
