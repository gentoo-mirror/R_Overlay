		Meta-Analysis of Generalized Additive Models // Meta-analysis of
		generalized additive models and generalized additive mixed
		models. A typical use case is when data cannot be shared across
		locations, and an overall meta-analytic fit is sought.
		'metagam' provides functionality for removing individual
		participant data from models computed using the 'mgcv' and
		'gamm4' packages such that the model objects can be shared
		without exposing individual data. Furthermore, methods for
		meta-analysing these fits are provided. The implemented methods
		are described in Sorensen et al. (2020),
		doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117416, extending previous works
		by Schwartz and Zanobetti (2000) and Crippa et al. (2018)
		doi:10.6000/1929-6029.2018.07.02.1.
