		Robust Marginal Bayesian Variable Selection for Gene-Environment
		Interactions // Recently, multiple marginal variable selection
		methods have been developed and shown to be effective in Gene-
		Environment interactions studies. We propose a novel marginal
		Bayesian variable selection method for Gene-Environment
		interactions studies. In particular, our marginal Bayesian
		method is robust to data contamination and outliers in the
		outcome variables. With the incorporation of spike-and-slab
		priors, we have implemented the Gibbs sampler based on Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo. The core algorithms of the package have been
		developed in 'C++'.
