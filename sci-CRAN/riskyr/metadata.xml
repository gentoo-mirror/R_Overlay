		Rendering Risk Literacy more Transparent // Risk-related
		information can be expressed in terms of probabilities or
		frequencies. By providing a toolbox of methods and metrics, we
		compute, translate, and represent risk-related information in a
		variety of ways. By offering different, but complementary
		perspectives on the interplay between key parameters, 'riskyr'
		renders teaching and training of risk literacy more
		transparent.
