		Rendering Risk Literacy more Transparent // Risk-related
		information (like the prevalence of conditions, the sensitivity
		and specificity of diagnostic tests, or the effectiveness of
		interventions or treatments) can be expressed in terms of
		frequencies or probabilities. By providing a toolbox of
		corresponding metrics and representations, 'riskyr' computes,
		translates, and visualizes risk-related information in a
		variety of ways. Adopting multiple complementary perspectives
		provides insights into the interplay between key parameters and
		renders teaching and training programs on risk literacy more
		transparent.
