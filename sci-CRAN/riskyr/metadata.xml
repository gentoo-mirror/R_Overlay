		Rendering Risk Literacy more Transparent // Risk-related
		information (like the prevalence of conditions and the
		sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests or treatment
		decisions) can be expressed in terms of probabilities or
		frequencies. By providing a toolbox of methods and metrics,
		'riskyr' computes, translates, and visualizes risk-related
		information in a variety of ways. Offering multiple
		complementary perspectives on the interplay between key
		parameters renders teaching and training of risk literacy more
		transparent.
