		Brainerd-Robinson Similarity Coefficient Matrix // Provides the
		facility to calculate the Brainerd-Robinson similarity
		coefficient for the rows of an input table, and to calculate
		the significance of each coefficient based on a permutation
		approach; optionally, hierarchical agglomerative clustering can
		be performed and the silhouette method is used to identify an
		optimal number of clusters.
