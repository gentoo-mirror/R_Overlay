		Systematic Conservation Prioritization in R // Systematic
		conservation prioritization using mixed integer linear
		programming (MILP). It provides a flexible interface for
		building and solving conservation planning problems. Once
		built, conservation planning problems can be solved using a
		variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers.
		By using exact algorithm solvers, solutions can be generated
		that are guaranteed to be optimal (or within a pre-specified
		optimality gap). Furthermore, conservation problems can be
		constructed to optimize the spatial allocation of different
		management actions or zones, meaning that conservation
		practitioners can identify solutions that benefit multiple
		stakeholders. To solve large-scale or complex conservation
		planning problems, users should install the Gurobi optimization
		software (available from https://www.gurobi.com/) and the
		'gurobi' R package (see Gurobi Installation Guide vignette for
		details). Users can also install the IBM CPLEX software
		(https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-
		studio/cplex-optimizer) and the 'cplexAPI' R package (available
		at https://github.com/cran/cplexAPI). Additionally, the 'rcbc'
		R package (available at https://github.com/dirkschumacher/rcbc)
		can be used to generate solutions using the CBC optimization
		software (https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc). For further details,
		see Hanson et al. (2024) doi:10.1111/cobi.14376.
