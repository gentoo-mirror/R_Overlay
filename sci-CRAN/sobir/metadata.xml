		Significance of Boundaries // Separates significant boundary
		constraints in a dataset from illusions. A modified permutation
		test is applied using the no-data zone areas above the top-
		left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left boundary lines as
		test statistics. The observed no-data zone areas are compared
		to the distribution of the random permutations to calculate a
		p-value for each boundary line. An article detailing the
		methodologies and rationale is currently in preparation.
