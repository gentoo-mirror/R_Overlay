		High Performance Cluster Models Based on Kiefer-Wolfowitz
		Recursion // Probabilistic models describing the behavior of
		workload and queue on a High Performance Cluster and computing
		GRID under FIFO service discipline basing on modified Kiefer-
		Wolfowitz recursion. Also sample data for inter-arrival times,
		service times, number of cores per task and waiting times of
		HPC of Karelian Research Centre are included, measurements took
		place from 06/03/2009 to 02/30/2011. Functions provided to
		import/export workload traces in Standard Workload Format
		(swf). Stability condition of the model may be verified either
		exactly, or approximately. Stability analysis: see Rumyantsev
		and Morozov (2017) doi:10.1007/s10479-015-1917-2, workload
		recursion: see Rumyantsev (2014) doi:10.1109/PDCAT.2014.36.
