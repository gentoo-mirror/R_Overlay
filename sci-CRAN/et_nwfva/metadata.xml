		Forest Yield Tables for Northwest Germany and their Application
		// The new yield tables developed by the Northwest German
		Forest Research Institute (NW-FVA) provide a forest management
		tool for the five main commercial tree species oak, beech,
		spruce, Douglas-fir and pine for northwestern Germany. The new
		method applied for deriving yield tables combines measurements
		of growth and yield trials with growth simulations using a
		state-of-the-art single-tree growth simulator. By doing so, the
		new yield tables reflect the current increment level and the
		recommended graduated thinning from above is the underlying
		management concept. The yield tables are provided along with
		methods for deriving the site index and for interpolating
		between age and site indices and extrapolating beyond age and
		site index ranges. The inter-/extrapolations are performed
		traditionally by the rule of proportion or with a functional
		approach.
