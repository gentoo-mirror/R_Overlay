		Bindings to the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' Raster API
		// Interface to the Raster API of the 'Geospatial Data
		Abstraction Library' ('GDAL') supporting manual creation of
		uninitialized datasets, creation from existing raster as
		template, low level I/O, configuration of virtual raster (VRT),
		coordinate transformation, and access to 'gdalwarp' for
		reprojection. Includes several 'GDAL' algorithms and functions
		for working with spatial reference systems. Calling signatures
		resemble the native C, C++ and Python APIs provided by the
		'GDAL' project (https://gdal.org). Bindings are implemented via
		exposed C++ class encapsulating a 'GDALDataset' and its
		associated 'GDALRasterBand' objects, plus several stand-alone
		functions. Additional functionality includes: class
		'RunningStats' for efficient summary statistics on large data
		streams; class 'CmbTable' for counting unique combinations of
		integers with a hash table; raster 'combine()' to identify and
		count unique pixel combinations across multiple input layers;
		raster 'calc()' to evaluate an R expression on a stack of
		layers with pixel coordinates available as variables in the
		expression; and raster display using base 'graphics'.
		'gdalraster' may be suitable for applications that primarily
		need low-level I/O or prefer a direct 'GDAL' API. The
		additional functionality is somewhat aimed at thematic data
		analysis but may have other utility.
