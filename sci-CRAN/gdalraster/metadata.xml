		Bindings to the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' Raster API
		// Interface to the raster API of the 'Geospatial Data
		Abstraction Library' ('GDAL') supporting manual creation of
		uninitialized datasets, creation from existing raster as
		template, low level I/O, configuration of virtual raster (VRT),
		coordinate transformation, and access to 'gdalwarp' for
		reprojection. Convenience functions facilitate working with
		spatial reference systems. Calling signatures resemble the
		native C, C++ and Python APIs provided by the 'GDAL' project
		(https://gdal.org). Bindings to 'GDAL' are implemented in class
		'GDALRaster' along with several stand-alone functions.
		Additional functionality includes: class 'RunningStats' for
		efficient summary statistics on large data streams; class
		'CmbTable' for counting unique combinations of integer values
		with a hash table; a raster overlay utility to identify and
		count unique combinations across multiple inputs; and a
		calculation utility for evaluating an R expression on raster
		layers with pixel coordinates available as variables.
		'gdalraster' may be suitable for applications that primarily
		need low-level raster I/O or prefer native 'GDAL'-like calling.
		Additional functionality is somewhat aimed at thematic data
		analysis but may have other utility.
