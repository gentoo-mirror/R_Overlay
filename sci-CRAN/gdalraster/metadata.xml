		Bindings to the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' Raster API
		// Interface to the Raster API of the 'Geospatial Data
		Abstraction Library' ('GDAL', https://gdal.org). Bindings are
		implemented in an exposed C++ class encapsulating a
		'GDALDataset' and its raster band objects, along with several
		stand-alone functions. These support manual creation of
		uninitialized datasets, creation from existing raster as
		template, read/set dataset parameters, low level I/O, color
		tables, raster attribute tables, virtual raster (VRT), and
		'gdalwarp' wrapper for reprojection and mosaicing. Includes
		'GDAL' algorithms ('dem_proc()', 'polygonize()', 'rasterize()',
		etc.), and functions for coordinate transformation and spatial
		reference systems. Calling signatures resemble the native C,
		C++ and Python APIs provided by the 'GDAL' project. Includes
		raster 'calc()' to evaluate a given R expression on a layer or
		stack of layers, with pixel x/y available as variables in the
		expression; and raster 'combine()' to identify and count unique
		pixel combinations across multiple input layers, with optional
		output of the pixel-level combination IDs. Provides raster
		display using base 'graphics'. Bindings to a subset of the
		'OGR' API are also included for managing vector data sources.
		Bindings to a subset of the Virtual Systems Interface ('VSI')
		are also included to support operations on 'GDAL' virtual file
		systems. These are general utility functions that abstract file
		system operations on URLs, cloud storage services,
		'Zip'/'GZip'/'7z'/'RAR' archives, and in-memory files.
		'gdalraster' may be useful in applications that need scalable,
		low-level I/O, or prefer a direct 'GDAL' API.
