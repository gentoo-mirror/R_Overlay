		Construct Consistent Time Series from Textual Data // A rolling
		version of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation, see Rieger et al.
		(2021) doi:10.18653/v1/2021.findings-emnlp.201. By a sequential
		approach, it enables the construction of LDA-based time series
		of topics that are consistent with previous states of LDA
		models. After an initial modeling, updates can be computed
		efficiently, allowing for real-time monitoring and detection of
		events or structural breaks.
