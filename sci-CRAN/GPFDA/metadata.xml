		Gaussian Process Regression for Functional Data Analysis //
		Functionalities for modelling functional data with
		multidimensional inputs, multivariate functional data, and non-
		separable and/or non-stationary covariance structure of
		function-valued processes. In addition, there are
		functionalities for functional regression models where the mean
		function depends on scalar and/or functional covariates and the
		covariance structure depends on functional covariates. The
		development version of the package can be found on
		https://github.com/gpfda/GPFDA-dev.
