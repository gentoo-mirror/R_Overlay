		Doubly Robust Distribution Balancing Weighting Estimation //
		Implements the doubly robust distribution balancing weighting
		proposed by Katsumata (2024) doi:10.1017/psrm.2024.23, which
		improves the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) by
		estimating propensity scores with estimating equations suitable
		for the pre-specified parameter of interest (e.g., the average
		treatment effects or the average treatment effects on the
		treated) and estimating outcome models with the estimated
		inverse probability weights. It also implements the covariate
		balancing propensity score proposed by Imai and Ratkovic (2014)
		doi:10.1111/rssb.12027 and the entropy balancing weighting
		proposed by Hainmueller (2012) doi:10.1093/pan/mpr025, both of
		which use covariate balancing conditions in propensity score
		estimation. The point estimate of the parameter of interest and
		its uncertainty as well as coefficients for propensity score
		estimation and outcome regression are produced using the
		M-estimation. The same functions can be used to estimate
		average outcomes in missing outcome cases.
