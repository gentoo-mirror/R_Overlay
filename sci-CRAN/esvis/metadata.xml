		Visualization and Estimation of Effect Sizes // A variety of
		methods are provided to estimate and visualize distributional
		differences in terms of effect sizes. Particular emphasis is
		upon evaluating differences between two or more distributions
		across the entire scale, rather than at a single point (e.g.,
		differences in means). For example, Probability-Probability
		(PP) plots display the difference between two or more
		distributions, matched by their empirical CDFs (see Ho and
		Reardon, 2012; doi:10.3102/1076998611411918), allowing for
		examinations of where on the scale distributional differences
		are largest or smallest. The area under the PP curve (AUC) is
		an effect-size metric, corresponding to the probability that a
		randomly selected observation from the x-axis distribution will
		have a higher value than a randomly selected observation from
		the y-axis distribution. Binned effect size plots are also
		available, in which the distributions are split into bins (set
		by the user) and separate effect sizes (Cohen's d) are produced
		for each bin - again providing a means to evaluate the
		consistency (or lack thereof) of the difference between two or
		more distributions at different points on the scale. Evaluation
		of empirical CDFs is also provided, with  built-in arguments
		for providing annotations to help evaluate distributional
		differences at specific points (e.g., semi-transparent
		shading). All function take a consistent argument structure.
		Calculation of specific effect sizes is also possible. The
		following effect sizes are estimable: (a) Cohen's d, (b)
		Hedges' g, (c) percentage above a cut, (d) transformed
		(normalized) percentage above a cut, (e)  area under the PP
		curve, and (f) the V statistic (see Ho, 2009;
		doi:10.3102/1076998609332755), which essentially transforms the
		area under the curve to standard deviation units. By default,
		effect sizes are calculated for all possible pairwise
		comparisons, but a reference group (distribution) can be
		specified.
