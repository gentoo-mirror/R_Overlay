		Evolutionary Computation in R // Framework for building
		evolutionary algorithms for both single- and multi-objective
		continuous or discrete optimization problems. A set of
		predefined evolutionary building blocks and operators is
		included. Moreover, the user can easily set up custom objective
		functions, operators, building blocks and representations
		sticking to few conventions. The package allows both a black-
		box approach for standard tasks (plug-and-play style) and a
		much more flexible white-box approach where the evolutionary
		cycle is written by hand.
