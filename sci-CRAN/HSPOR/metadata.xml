		Hidden Smooth Polynomial Regression for Rupture Detection //
		Several functions that allow by different methods to infer a
		piecewise polynomial regression model under regularity
		constraints, namely continuity or differentiability of the link
		function. The implemented functions are either specific to data
		with two regimes, or generic for any number of regimes, which
		can be given by the user or learned by the algorithm. A paper
		describing all these methods will be submitted soon. The
		reference will be added to this file as soon as available.
