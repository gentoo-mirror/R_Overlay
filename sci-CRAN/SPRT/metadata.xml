		Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) Method // Provides
		functions to perform the Sequential Probability Ratio Test
		(SPRT) for hypothesis testing in Binomial, Poisson and Normal
		distributions. The package allows users to specify Type I and
		Type II error probabilities, decision thresholds, and compare
		null and alternative hypotheses sequentially as data
		accumulate. It includes visualization tools for plotting the
		likelihood ratio path and decision boundaries, making it easier
		to interpret results. The methods are based on Wald (1945)
		doi:10.1214/aoms/1177731118, who introduced the SPRT as one of
		the earliest and most powerful sequential analysis techniques.
		This package is useful in quality control, clinical trials, and
		other applications requiring early decision-making.The term
		'SPRT' is an abbreviation and used intentionally.
