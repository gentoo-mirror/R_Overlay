		Backfill Bayesian Optimal Interval Design Using Efficacy and
		Toxicity // The backfill Bayesian optimal interval design using
		efficacy and toxicity outcomes for dose optimization (BF-BOIN-
		ET) design is a novel clinical trial design to allow patients
		to be backfilled at lower doses during a dose-finding trial
		while prioritizing the dose-escalation cohort to explore a
		higher dose. The advantages compared to the other designs in
		terms of the percentage of correct optimal dose (OD) selection,
		reducing the sample size, and shortening the duration of the
		trial, in various realistic setting.
