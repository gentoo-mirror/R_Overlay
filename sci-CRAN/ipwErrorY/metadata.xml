		Inverse Probability Weighted Estimation of Average Treatment
		Effect with Misclassified Binary Outcome // An implementation
		of the correction methods proposed by Shu and Yi (2017)
		doi:10.1177/0962280217743777 for the inverse probability
		weighted (IPW) estimation of average treatment effect (ATE)
		with misclassified binary outcomes. Logistic regression model
		is assumed for treatment model for all implemented correction
		methods, and is assumed for the outcome model for the
		implemented doubly robust correction method. Misclassification
		probability given a true value of the outcome is assumed to be
		the same for all individuals.
