		Inverse Probability Weighting Estimation of Average Treatment
		Effect with Outcome Misclassification // An implementation of
		the correction methods proposed by Shu and Yi (2017)
		doi:10.1177/0962280217743777 for the inverse probability
		weighting (IPW) estimation of average treatment effect (ATE)
		with misclassified outcomes. Logistic regression model is
		assumed for treatment model for all implemented correction
		methods, and is assumed for the outcome model for the
		implemented doubly robust correction method.
