		Amino Acid Substitution Effect Analyser // Given a protein
		multiple sequence alignment, it is daunting task to assess the
		effects of substitutions along sequence length. 'aaSEA' package
		is intended to help researchers to rapidly analyse property
		changes caused by single, multiple and correlated amino acid
		substitutions in proteins. Methods for identification of co-
		evolving positions from multiple sequence alignment are as
		described in :  Pel et al., (2017)
