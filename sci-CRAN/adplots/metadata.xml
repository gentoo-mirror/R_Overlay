		Ad-Plot and Ud-Plot for Visualizing Distributional Properties and
		Normality // The empirical cumulative average deviation
		function introduced by the author is utilized to develop both
		Ad- and Ud-plots. The Ad-plot can identify symmetry, skewness,
		and outliers of the data distribution, including anomalies. The
		Ud-plot created by slightly modifying Ad-plot is exceptional in
		assessing normality, outperforming normal QQ-plot, normal PP-
		plot, and their derivations. The d-value that quantifies the
		degree of proximity between the Ud-plot and the graph of the
		estimated normal density function helps guide to make decisions
		on confirmation of normality. Full description of this
		methodology can be found in the article by Wijesuriya (2025)
