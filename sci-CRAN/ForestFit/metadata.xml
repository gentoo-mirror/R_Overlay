		Statistical Modelling with Applications in Forestry // Developed
		for the following tasks. I) Computing the probability density
		function, cumulative distribution function, random generation,
		and estimating the parameters of the eleven mixture models
		including mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders, BurrXII, Chen, F,
		Frechet, gamma, Gompertz, log-logistic, log-normal, Lomax, and
		Weibull. II) Point estimation of the parameters of two- and
		three-parameter Weibull distributions. In the case of two-
		parameter, twelve methods consist of generalized least square
		type 1, generalized least square type 2, L-moment, maximum
		likelihood, logarithmic moment, moment, percentile, rank
		correlation, least square, weighted maximum likelihood,
		U-statistic, weighted least square are used and investigated
		methods for the three-parameter case are: maximum likelihood,
		modified moment type 1, modified moment type 2, modified moment
		type 3, modified maximum likelihood type 1, modified maximum
		likelihood type 2, modified maximum likelihood type 3, modified
		maximum likelihood type 4, moment, maximum product spacing, T-L
		moment, and weighted maximum likelihood. III) The Bayesian
		estimators of the three-parameter Weibull distribution. IV)
		Estimating parameters of the three-parameter Weibull
		distribution fitted to grouped data using three methods
		including approximated maximum likelihood, expectation
		maximization, and maximum likelihood. V) Estimating the
		parameters of the gamma, log-normal, and Weibull mixture models
		fitted to the grouped data through the EM algorithm. VI)
		Estimating parameters of the non-linear growth curve fitted to
		the height-diameter observations.
