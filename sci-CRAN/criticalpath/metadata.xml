		An Implementation of the Critical Path Method // An R6 object
		oriented implementation of the Critical Path Method (CPM). CPM
		is a method used to estimate the minimum project duration and
		determine the amount of scheduling flexibility on the logical
		network paths within the schedule model. The flexibility is in
		terms of early start, early finish, late start, late finish,
		total float and free float. Beside, it permits to quantify the
		complexity of network diagram through the analysis of
		topological indicators. Finally, it permits to change the
		activities duration to perform what-if scenario analysis. The
		package was built based on following references: To make
		topological sorting and other graph operation, we use Csardi,
		G.  Nepusz, T. (2005) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/
		221995787_The_Igraph_Software_Package_for_Complex_Network_Resea
		rch; For schedule concept, the reference was Project Management
		Institute (2017) https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-
		standards/foundational/pmbok; For standards terms, we use
		Project Management Institute (2017) https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-
		guide-standards/lexicon; For algorithms on Critical Path Method
		development, we use Vanhoucke, M. (2013)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-642-40438-2 and Vanhoucke, M. (2014)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-04331-9; And, finally, for topological
		definitions, we use Vanhoucke, M. (2009)
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1014-1.
