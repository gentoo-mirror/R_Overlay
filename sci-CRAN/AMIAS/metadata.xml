		Alternating Minimization Induced Active Set Algorithms // An
		implementation of alternating minimization induced active set
		(AMIAS) method for solving the L0 regularized learning
		problems. It includes a piecewise smooth estimator by
		minimizing the least squares function with constraints on the
		number of kink points in the discrete derivatives. It also
		includes generalized structural sparsity via composite L0
		penalty. Both time series and image segmentation can be handled
		by this package.
