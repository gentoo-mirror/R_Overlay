		Fitting and Assessing Neighborhood Models of the Effect of
		Interspecific Competition on the Growth of Trees // Code for
		fitting and assessing models for the growth of trees. In
		particular for the Bayesian neighborhood competition linear
		regression model of Allen (2020): methods for model fitting and
		generating fitted/predicted values, evaluating the effect of
		competitor species identity using permutation tests, and
		evaluating model performance using spatial cross-validation.
