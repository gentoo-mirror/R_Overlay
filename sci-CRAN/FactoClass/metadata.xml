		Combination of Factorial Methods and Cluster Analysis // Some
		functions of 'ade4' and 'stats' are combined in order to obtain
		a partition of the rows of a data table, with columns
		representing variables of scales: quantitative, qualitative or
		frequency. First, a principal axes method is performed and
		then, a combination of Ward agglomerative hierarchical
		classification and K-means is performed, using some of the
		first coordinates obtained from the previous principal axes
		method. The function 'kmeansW', a modification of 'kmeans',
		programmed in C++, is included, in order to permit to have
		different weights of the elements to be clustered. Some
		complementary functions and datasets are included. See, for
		example: Lebart, L. and Piron, M. and Morineau, A.  (2006).
