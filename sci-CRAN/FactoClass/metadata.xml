		Combination of Factorial Methods and Cluster Analysis // Some
		functions of 'ade4' and 'stats' are combined in order to obtain
		a partition of the rows of a data table, with columns
		representing variables of scales: quantitative, qualitative or
		frequency. First, a principal axes method is performed and
		then, a combination of Ward agglomerative hierarchical
		classification and K-means is performed, using some of the
		first coordinates obtained from the previous principal axes
		method. In order to permit different weights of the elements to
		be clustered, the function 'kmeansW', programmed in C++, is
		included. It is a modification of 'kmeans'. Some graphical
		functions include the option: 'gg=FALSE'.  When 'gg=TRUE', they
		use the 'ggplot2' and 'ggrepel' packages to avoid  the super-
		position of the labels.
