		Selecting Combinations of Predictors by Leveraging Multiple AUCs
		for an Ordered Multilevel Outcome // Uses multiple AUCs to
		select a combination of predictors when the outcome has
		multiple (ordered) levels and the focus is discriminating one
		particular level from the others. This method is most naturally
		applied to settings where the outcome has three levels.
