		Using Multiple Continuous Biomarkers for Patient Enrichment in
		Two-Stage Clinical Designs // Enrichment strategies play a
		critical role in modern clinical trial design, especially as
		precision medicine advances the focus on patient-specific
		efficacy. Recent developments in enrichment design have
		introduced biomarker randomness and accounted for the
		correlation structure between treatment effect and biomarker,
		resulting in a two-stage threshold enrichment design. We
		propose novel two-stage enrichment designs capable of handling
		two or more continuous biomarkers. See Zhang, F. and Gou, J.
		(2025). Using multiple biomarkers for patient enrichment in
		two-stage clinical designs. Technical Report.
