		Genetics Input/Output Functions // Implements readers and writers
		for file formats associated with genetics data.  Reading and
		writing plink BED/BIM/FAM formats is fully supported, including
		a lightning-fast BED reader and writer implementations.  Other
		functions are 'readr' wrappers that are more constrained, user-
		friendly, and efficient for these particular applications;
		handles plink and eigenstrat tables (FAM, BIM, IND, and SNP
		files).  There are also "make" functions for FAM and BIM tables
		with default values to go with simulated genotype data.
