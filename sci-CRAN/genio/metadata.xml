		Genetics Input/Output Functions // Implements readers and writers
		for file formats associated with genetics data.  Reading and
		writing Plink BED/BIM/FAM and GCTA binary GRM formats is fully
		supported, including a lightning-fast BED reader and writer
		implementations.  Other functions are 'readr' wrappers that are
		more constrained, user-friendly, and efficient for these
		particular applications; handles Plink and Eigenstrat tables
		(FAM, BIM, IND, and SNP files).  There are also make functions
		for FAM and BIM tables with default values to go with simulated
		genotype data.
