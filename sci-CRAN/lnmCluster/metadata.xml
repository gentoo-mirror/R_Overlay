		Perform Logistic Normal Multinomial Clustering for Microbiome
		Compositional Data // An implementation of logistic normal
		multinomial (LNM) clustering. It is an extension of LNM mixture
		model proposed by Fang and Subedi (2020) arXiv:2011.06682, and
		is designed for clustering compositional data. The package
		includes 3 extended models: LNM Factor Analyzer (LNM-FA), LNM
		Bicluster Mixture Model (LNM-BMM) and Penalized LNM Factor
		Analyzer (LNM-FA). There are several advantages of LNM models:
		1. LNM provides more flexible covariance structure; 2. Factor
		analyzer can reduce the number of parameters to estimate; 3.
		Bicluster can simultaneously cluster subjects and taxa, and
		provides significant biological insights; 4. Penalty term
		allows sparse estimation in the covariance matrix. Details for
		model assumptions and interpretation can be found in papers: Tu
		and Subedi (2021) arXiv:2101.01871 and Tu and Subedi (2022)
		doi:10.1002/sam.11555.
