		Partial Orders in Socio-Economics // Implements basic partial
		order tools for multidimensional poverty evaluation with
		ordinal variables. Its main goal is to provide socio-economic
		scholars with an integrated set of elementary functions for
		multidimensional poverty evaluation, based on ordinal
		information. The package is organized in four main parts. The
		first two comprise functions for data management and basic
		partial order analysis; the third and the fourth are devoted to
		evaluation and implement both the poset-based approach and a
		more classical counting procedure. References, Fattore M.
