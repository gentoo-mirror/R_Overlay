		Tools for Data Manipulation and Testing // This is a set of
		simple utilities for various data manipulation and testing
		tasks. The goal is to use base tools well, without bringing in
		many dependencies. Main areas of interest are semi-automated
		data frame manipulation, such as converting factors in multiple
		binary indicator columns. There are testing functions which
		provide 'testthat' expectations to permute arguments to
		function calls. There are functions and data to test extreme
		numbers, dates, and bad input of various kinds which should
		allow testing failure and corner cases, which can be used for
		fuzzing your functions. The test suite has many examples of
		usage.
