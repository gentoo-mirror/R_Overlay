		Linear Trend Segmentation // Performs the detection of linear
		trend changes for univariate time series by implementing the
		bottom-up unbalanced wavelet transformation proposed by H.
		Maeng and P. Fryzlewicz (2021). The estimated number and
		locations of the change-points are returned with the piecewise-
		linear estimator for signal.
