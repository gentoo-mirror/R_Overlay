		Linear Trend Segmentation and Point Anomaly Detection // Performs
		the detection of point anomalies and linear trend changes for
		univariate time series by implementing the bottom-up unbalanced
		wavelet transformation proposed by H. Maeng and P. Fryzlewicz
		(2019) http://personal.lse.ac.uk/maengh/. The estimated number
		and locations of the change-points are returned with the
		piecewise-linear estimator for signal.
