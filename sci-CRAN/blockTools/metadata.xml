		Block, Assign, and Diagnose Potential Interference in Randomized
		Experiments // Blocks units into experimental blocks, with one
		unit per treatment condition, by creating a measure of
		multivariate distance between all possible pairs of units.
		Maximum, minimum, or an allowable range of differences between
		units on one variable can be set. Randomly assign units to
		treatment conditions. Diagnose potential interference between
		units assigned to different treatment conditions.  Write
		outputs to .tex and .csv files. For more information on the
		methods implemented, see Moore (2012) doi:10.1093/pan/mps025.
