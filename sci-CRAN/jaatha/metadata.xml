		Simulation-Based Maximum Likelihood Parameter Estimation // An
		estimation method that can use computer simulations to
		approximate maximum-likelihood estimates even when the
		likelihood function can not be evaluated directly. It can be
		applied whenever it is feasible to conduct many simulations,
		but works best when the data is approximately Poisson
		distributed. It was originally designed for demographic
		inference in evolutionary biology (Naduvilezhath et al., 2011
		doi:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05131.x, Mathew et al., 2013
		doi:10.1002/ece3.722). It has optional support for conducting
		coalescent simulation using the 'coala' package.
