		Adaptive Gauss Hermite Quadrature for Bayesian Inference //
		Adaptive Gauss Hermite Quadrature for Bayesian inference. The
		AGHQ method for normalizing posterior distributions and making
		Bayesian inferences based on them. Functions are provided for
		doing quadrature and marginal Laplace approximations, and
		summary methods are provided for making inferences based on the
		results. See Stringer (2021). "Implementing Adaptive Quadrature
		for Bayesian Inference: the aghq Package" arXiv:2101.04468.
