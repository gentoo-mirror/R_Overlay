		Calculate Concentration and Dispersion in Ordered Rating Scales
		// Calculates concentration and dispersion in ordered rating
		scales. It implements various measures of concentration and
		dispersion to describe what researchers variably call
		agreement, concentration, consensus, dispersion, or
		polarization among respondents in ordered data. It also
		implements other related measures to classify distributions. In
		addition to a generic city-block based concentration measure
		and a generic dispersion measure, the package implements
		various measures, including van der Eijk's (2001) DOI:
		10.1023/A:1010374114305 measure of agreement A, measures of
		concentration by Leik, Tatsle and Wierman, Blair and Lacy,
		Kvalseth, Berry and Mielke, Reardon, and Garcia-Montalvo and
		Reynal-Querol. Furthermore, the package provides an
		implementation of Galtungs AJUS-system to classify
		distributions, as well as a function to identify the position
		of multiple modes.
