		Phase I Optimal Dose Assignment using the FBCRM and MFBCRM
		Methods // Performs dose assignment and trial simulation for
		the FBCRM (Fully Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method) and
		MFBCRM (Mixture Fully Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method)
		phase I clinical trial designs. These trial designs extend the
		Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and Bayesian Model
		Averaging Continual Reassessment Method (BMA-CRM) by allowing
		the prior toxicity skeleton itself to be random, with posterior
		distributions obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo. On
		average, the FBCRM and MFBCRM methods outperformed the CRM and
		BMA-CRM methods in terms of selecting an optimal dose level
		across thousands of randomly generated simulation scenarios.
		Details on the methods and results of this simulation study are
		available on request, and the manuscript is currently under
		review.
