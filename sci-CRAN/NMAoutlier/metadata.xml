		Detecting Outliers in Network Meta-Analysis // A set of functions
		providing several outlier (i.e., studies with extreme findings)
		and influential detection measures and methodologies in network
		meta-analysis: - Simple outlier and influential deletion
		measures provided: (a) Raw, (b) Standardized, (c) Studentized
		residuals; (d) Mahalanobis distance and (c) leverage. - Outlier
		and influential detection measures by considering study
		deletion (Shift the mean): (a) Raw (b) Standardized, (c)
		Studentized deleted residuals; (d) Cook distance; (e) Ratio of
		variance-covariance matrix; (f) weight leave one out; (g)
		leverage leave one out; (h) heterogeneity leave one out; (i) R
		heterogeneity; (k) R Q total; (l) R Q heterogeneity (m);  R Q
		inconsistency and (n) statistic that indicate the effect that
		deleting each study has on the treatment estimates. - Plots for
		outlier and influential detection simply and deletion measures
		(all the above measures) and Q-Q plot for network meta-
		analysis. - Forward Search algorithm in network meta-analysis.
		- Forward plots for the monitoring statistics in each step of
		Forward search algorithm: (a) P-scores; (b) z-values for
		difference of direct and indirect evidence with back-
		calculation method; (c) Standardized residuals; (d)
		heterogeneity variance estimator; (e) cook distance; (f) ratio
		of variances; (g) Q statistics. - Forward plots for summary
		estimates and their confidence intervals in each step of
		forward search algorithm.
