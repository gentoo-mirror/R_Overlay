		Detecting Outliers in Network Meta-Analysis // A set of functions
		providing the forward search algorithm for detecting outlying
		studies (i.e., studies with extreme findings) in network meta-
		analysis: - provides the length of the initial subset for
		forward search algorithm; - iterations of forward search
		algorithm; - basic set of studies in each step of forward
		search algorithm; - summary estimates and their confidence
		intervals in each step of forward search algorithm; - outlying
		case diagnostics measures; - ranking measures; - heterogeneity
		and inconsistency measures; - forward plot for summary
		estimates and their confidence intervals; - forward plots for
		monitored measures: outlying case diagnostics measures, ranking
		measures, heterogeneity, and inconsistency measures.
