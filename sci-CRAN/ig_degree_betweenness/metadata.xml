		"Smith-Pittman Community Detection Algorithm for 'igraph' Objects
		(2024)" // Implements the "Smith-Pittman" community detection
		algorithm for network analysis using 'igraph' objects. This
		algorithm combines node degree and betweenness centrality
		measures to identify communities within networks, with a
		gradient evident in social partitioning. The package provides
		functions for community detection, visualization, and analysis
		of the resulting community structure. Methods are based on
		results from Smith, Pittman and Xu (2024)
