		Visualize Dominant Variables in Wavelet Multiple Correlation //
		Estimates and plots as a heat map the correlation coefficients
		obtained via the wavelet local multiple correlation 'WLMC'
		(Fernndez-Macho 2018) and the 'dominant' variable/s, i.e., the
		variable/s that maximizes the multiple correlation through time
		and scale (Polanco-Martnez et al. 2020, Polanco-Martnez 2022).
		We improve the graphical outputs of WLMC proposing a didactic
		and useful way to visualize the 'dominant' variable(s) for a
		set of time series. The WLMC was designed for financial time
		series, but other kinds of data (e.g., climatic, ecological,
		etc.) can be used. The functions contained in 'VisualDom' are
		highly flexible since these contains several parameters to
		personalize the time series under analysis and the heat maps.
		In addition, we have also included two data sets (named
		'rdata_climate' and 'rdata_Lorenz') to exemplify the use of the
		functions contained in 'VisualDom'. Methods derived from
		Fernndez-Macho (2018) doi:10.1016/j.physa.2017.11.050, Polanco-
		Martnez et al. (2020) doi:10.1038/s41598-020-77767-8 and
		Polanco-Martnez (2023, in press).
