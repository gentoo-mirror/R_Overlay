		Simulate Spatial Bernoulli Networks // Social network analysis is
		becoming commonplace in many social science disciplines, but
		access to useful network data, especially among marginalized
		populations, still remains a formidable challenge. This package
		mitigates that problem by providing tools to simulate spatial
		Bernoulli networks as proposed in Carter T. Butts (2002,
		ISBN:978-0-493-72676-2), "Spatial models of large-scale
		interpersonal networks." Using this package, network analysts
		can simulate a spatial point process or sequence with a given
		number of nodes inside a geographical boundary and estimate the
		probability of a tie formation between all node pairs. When
		simulating a network, an analyst can choose between five
		spatial interaction functions. The package also enables quick
		comparison of summary statistics for simulated networks and
		provides simple to use plotting methods for its classes that
		return plots which can be further refined with the 'ggplot2'
		package.
