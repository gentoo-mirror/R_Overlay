		Single Cell Mapper // Description of scMappR R package adapted
		from pre-print. The single cell mapper (scMappR) R package
		contains a suite of bioinformatic tools that provide
		experimentally relevant cell-type specific information to a
		list of differentially expressed genes (DEG). The function
		"scMappR_and_pathway_analysis" reranks DEGs to generate cell-
		type specificity scores called cell-weighted fold-changes.
		Users input a list of DEGs, normalized counts, and a signature
		matrix into this function. scMappR then re-weights bulk DEGs by
		cell-type specific expression from the signature matrix, cell-
		type proportions from RNA-seq deconvolution and the ratio of
		cell-type proportions between the two conditions to account for
		changes in cell-type proportion. With cwFold-changes
		calculated, scMappR uses two approaches to utilize cwFold-
		changes to complete cell-type specific pathway analysis. The
		"process_dgTMatrix_lists" function in the scMappR package
		contains an automated scRNA-seq processing pipeline where users
		input scRNA-seq count data, which is made compatible for
		scMappR and other R packages that analyze scRNA-seq data. We
		further used this to store hundreds up regularly updating
		signature matrices. The functions
		"tissue_by_celltype_enrichment", "tissue_scMappR_internal", and
		"tissue_scMappR_custom" combine these consistently processed
		scRNAseq count data with gene-set enrichment tools to allow for
		cell-type marker enrichment of a generic gene list (e.g. GWAS
		hits). Reference: Sokolowski,D.J., Faykoo-Martinez,M.,

		scRNA-seq to infer cell-type specificities of differentially
		expressed genes. BioRxiv, 10.1101/2020.08.24.265298.
