		Single Cell Mapper // Statistical tools to interrogate the cell-
		type specificity of any gene list given a matrix of cell-types
		and genes associated with those cell-types (a signature
		matrix). Additionally, a library of over 245 signature matrices
		from public data are stored. Together, there are four primary
		functions: (i) processing scRNA-seq count data and automated
		cell-type naming using 'Seurat' V3 and enrichment of CellMarker
		and Panglao databases, (ii) tissue-by-cell-type gene set
		enrichment, (iii) cell-type specific enrichment of a gene list
		within a particular tissue, (iv) weighted cell-type specific
		reranking of a list of differentially expressed genes.
