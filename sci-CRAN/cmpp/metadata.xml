		Direct Parametric Inference for the Cumulative Incidence Function
		in Competing Risks // Implements parametric (Direct) regression
		methods for modeling cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) in
		the presence of competing risks. Methods include the direct
		Gompertz-based approach and generalized regression models as
		described in Jeong and Fine (2006)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2006.00532.x and Jeong and Fine (2007)
		doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxj040. The package facilitates
		maximum likelihood estimation, variance computation, with
		applications to clinical trials and survival analysis.
