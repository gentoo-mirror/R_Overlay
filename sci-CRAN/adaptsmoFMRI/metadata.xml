		Adaptive Smoothing of FMRI Data // Adaptive smoothing functions
		for estimating the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
		effect by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
		data, based on adaptive Gauss Markov random fields, for real as
		well as simulated data. The implemented models make use of
		efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Implemented methods
		are based on the research developed by A. Brezger, L. Fahrmeir,
		A. Hennerfeind (2007) https://www.jstor.org/stable/4626770.
