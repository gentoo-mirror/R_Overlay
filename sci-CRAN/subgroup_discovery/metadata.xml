		Subgroup Discovery and Bump Hunting // Developed to assist in
		discovering interesting subgroups in high-dimensional data. The
		PRIM implementation is based on the 1998 paper "Bump hunting in
		high-dimensional data" by Jerome H. Friedman and Nicholas I.
		Fisher. doi:10.1023/A:1008894516817 PRIM involves finding a set
		of "rules" which combined imply unusually large (or small)
		values of some other target variable. Specifically one tries to
		find a set of sub regions in which the target variable is
		substantially larger than overall mean. The objective of bump
		hunting in general is to find regions in the input
		(attribute/feature) space with relatively high (low) values for
		the target variable. The regions are described by simple rules
		of the type if: condition-1 and ... and condition-n then:
		estimated target value. Given the data (or a subset of the
		data), the goal is to produce a box B within which the target
		mean is as large as possible. There are many problems where
		finding such regions is of considerable practical interest.
		Often these are problems where a decision maker can in a sense
		choose or select the values of the input variables so as to
		optimize the value of the target variable. In bump hunting it
		is customary to follow a so-called covering strategy. This
		means that the same box construction (rule induction) algorithm
		is applied sequentially to subsets of the data.
