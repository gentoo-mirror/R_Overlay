		Easy Michaelis-Menten Enzyme Kinetics // Serves as a platform for
		published fluorometric enzyme assay protocols. 'ezmmek'
		calibrates, calculates, and plots enzyme activities as they
		relate to the transformation of synthetic substrates. At
		present, 'ezmmek' implements two common protocols found in the
		literature, and is modular to accommodate additional protocols.
		Here, these protocols are referred to as the In-Sample
		Calibration (Hoppe, 1983; doi:10.3354/meps011299) and In-Buffer
		Calibration (German et al., 2011;
		doi:10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.03.017). protocols. By containing
		multiple protocols, 'ezmmek' aims to stimulate discussion about
		how to best optimize fluorometric enzyme assays. A standardized
		approach would make studies more comparable and reproducible.
