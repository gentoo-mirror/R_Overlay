		Simple and Fast ROC Curves // A set of functions for receiver
		operating characteristic (ROC) curve estimation and area under
		the curve (AUC) calculation. All functions are designed to work
		with aggregated data; nevertheless, they can also handle raw
		samples. In 'ROCket', we distinguish two types of ROC curve
		representations: 1) parametric curves - the true positive rate
		(TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) are functions of a
		parameter (the score), 2) functions - TPR is a function of FPR.
		There are several ROC curve estimation methods available. An
		introduction to the mathematical background of the implemented
		methods (and much more) can be found in de Zea Bermudez,
		Gonalves, Oliveira  Subtil (2014) and Cai  Pepe (2004).
