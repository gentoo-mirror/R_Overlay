		Global Triangular and Penta-Hexagonal Grids Based on Tessellated
		Icosahedra // Implementation of icosahedral grids in three
		dimensions. The spherical-triangular tessellation can be set to
		create grids with custom resolutions. Both the primary
		triangular and their inverted penta-hexagonal grids can be
		calculated. Additional functions are provided that allow
		plotting of the grids and associated data, the interaction of
		the grids with other raster and vector objects, and treating
		the grids as a graphs.
