		Global Triangular and Penta-Hexagonal Grids Based on Tessellated
		Icosahedra // Employs triangular tessellation to refine
		icosahedra defined in 3d space. The procedures can be set to
		provide a grid with a custom resolution. Both the primary
		triangular and their inverted penta- hexagonal grids are
		available for implementation. Additional functions are provided
		to position points (latitude-longitude data) on the grids, to
		allow 2D and 3D plotting, use raster data and shapefiles.
