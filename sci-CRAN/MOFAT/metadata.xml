		Maximum One-Factor-at-a-Time Designs // Identifying important
		factors from a large number of potentially important factors of
		a highly nonlinear and computationally expensive black box
		model is a difficult problem. Xiao, Joseph, and Ray (2022)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.2022.2141897 proposed Maximum One-Factor-
		at-a-Time (MOFAT) designs for doing this. A MOFAT design can be
		viewed as an improvement to the random one-factor-at-a-time
		(OFAT) design proposed by Morris (1991)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.1991.10484804. The improvement is achieved
		by exploiting the connection between Morris screening designs
		and Monte Carlo-based Sobol' designs, and optimizing the design
		using a space-filling criterion. This work is supported by a
		U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) grant CMMI-1921646
