		Modeling Multivariate Origins Determinants - Evolutionary
		Lineages in Ecology // Perform multivariate modeling of evolved
		traits, with special attention to understanding the interplay
		of the multi-factorial determinants of their origins in complex
		ecological settings (Stephens, 2007
		doi:10.1016/j.tree.2006.12.003). This software primarily
		concentrates on phylogenetic regression analysis, enabling
		implementation of tree transformation averaging and
		visualization functionality. Functions additionally support
		information theoretic approaches (Grueber, 2011
		doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02210.x; Garamszegi, 2011
		doi:10.1007/s00265-010-1028-7) such as model averaging and
		selection of phylogenetic models. There are other numerous
		functions for visualizing confounded variables, plotting
		phylogenetic trees, as well as reporting and exporting modeling
		results. Lastly, as challenges to ecology are inherently
		multifarious, and therefore often multi-dataset, this package
		features several functions to support the identification,
		interpolation, merging, and updating of missing data and
		outdated nomenclature.
