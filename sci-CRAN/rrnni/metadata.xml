		Manipulate with RNNI Tree Space // Calculate RNNI distance
		between and manipulate with ranked trees. RNNI stands for
		Ranked Nearest Neighbour Interchange and is an extension of the
		classical NNI space (space of trees created by the NNI moves)
		to ranked trees, where internal nodes are ordered according to
		their heights (usually assumed to be times). The RNNI distance
		takes the tree topology into account, as standard NNI does, but
		also penalizes changes in the order of internal nodes, i.e.
		changes in the order of times of evolutionary events. For more
		information about the RNNI space see: Gavryushkin et al. (2018)
