		Overfitting Bayesian Mixtures of Factor Analyzers with
		Parsimonious Covariance and Unknown Number of Components //
		Model-based clustering of multivariate continuous data using
		Bayesian mixtures of factor analyzers (Papastamoulis (2018)
		DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2018.03.007). The number of clusters is
		estimated using overfitting mixture models (Rousseau and
		Mengersen (2011) DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00781.x):
		suitable prior assumptions ensure that asymptotically the extra
		components will have zero posterior weight, therefore, the
		inference is based on the ``alive'' components. A Gibbs sampler
		is implemented in order to (approximately) sample from the
		posterior distribution of the overfitting mixture. A prior
		parallel tempering scheme is also available, which allows to
		run multiple parallel chains with different prior distributions
		on the mixture weights. These chains run in parallel and can
		swap states using a Metropolis-Hastings move. Eight different
		parameterizations give rise to parsimonious representations of
		the covariance per cluster (following Mc Nicholas and Murphy
		(2008) DOI:10.1007/s11222-008-9056-0). The model
		parameterization and number of factors is selected according to
		the Bayesian Information Criterion. Identifiability issues
		related to label switching are dealt by post-processing the
		simulated output with the Equivalence Classes Representatives
		algorithm (Papastamoulis and Iliopoulos (2010)
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/25703571, Papastamoulis (2016)
		DOI:10.18637/jss.v069.c01).
