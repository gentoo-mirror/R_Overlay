		Class-Focused Pattern Metric Comparisons using Simulation //
		Provides tools for estimating composition and configuration
		parameters from a categorical (binary) landscape map (grid) and
		then simulates a selected number of statistically similar
		landscapes.  Class-focused pattern metrics are computed for
		each simulated map to produce empirical distributions against
		which statistical comparisons can be made. The code permits the
		analysis of single maps or pairs of maps.  Current limitation
		is for binary (classes 1, 2) maps that are 64x64 cells in
		extent.
