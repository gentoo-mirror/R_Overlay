		Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion Tools // Implements various
		general algorithms to estimate missing elements of a Euclidean
		(squared) distance matrix. Includes optimization methods based
		on semi-definite programming found in Alfakih, Khadani, and
		Wolkowicz (1999)doi:10.1023/A:1008655427845, a non-convex
		position formulation by Fang and O'Leary
		(2012)doi:10.1080/10556788.2011.643888, and a dissimilarity
		parameterization formulation by Trosset
		(2000)doi:10.1023/A:1008722907820. When the only non-missing
		distances are those on the minimal spanning tree, the guided
		random search algorithm will complete the matrix while
		preserving the minimal spanning tree following Rahman and
		Oldford (2018)doi:10.1137/16M1092350. Point configurations in
		specified dimensions can be determined from the completions.
		Special problems such as the sensor localization problem, as
		for example in Krislock and Wolkowicz
		(2010)doi:10.1137/090759392, as well as reconstructing the
		geometry of a molecular structure, as for example in
		Hendrickson (1995)doi:10.1137/0805040, can also be solved.
		These and other methods are described in the thesis of Adam
		Rahman(2018)https://hdl.handle.net/10012/13365.
