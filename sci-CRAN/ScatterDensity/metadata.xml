		Density Estimation and Visualization of 2D Scatter Plots // The
		user has the option to utilize the two-dimensional density
		estimation techniques called smoothed density published by
		Eilers and Goeman (2004) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btg454, and
		pareto density which was evaluated for univariate data by
		Thrun, Gehlert and Ultsch, 2020
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0238835. Moreover, it provides
		visualizations of the density estimation in the form of two-
		dimensional scatter plots in which the points are color-coded
		based on increasing density. Colors are defined by the one-
		dimensional clustering technique called 1D distribution cluster
		algorithm (DDCAL) published by Lux and Rinderle-Ma (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s00357-022-09428-6.
