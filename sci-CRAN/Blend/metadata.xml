		Bayesian Longitudinal Regularized Semiparametric Quantile Mixed
		Models // Our recently developed fully Bayesian semiparametric
		quantile mixed-effect model for high-dimensional longitudinal
		studies with heterogeneous observations can be implemented
		through this package. This model can distinguish between time-
		varying interactions and constant-effect-only cases to avoid
		model misspecifications. Facilitated by spike-and-slab priors,
		this model leads to superior performance in estimation,
		identification and statistical inference. In particular, robust
		Bayesian inferences in terms of valid Bayesian credible
		intervals on both parametric and nonparametric effects can be
		validated on finite samples. The Markov chain Monte Carlo
		algorithms of the proposed and alternative models are
		efficiently implemented in 'C++'.
