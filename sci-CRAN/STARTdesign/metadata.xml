		Single to Double Arm Transition Design for Phase II Clinical
		Trials // The package is used for calibrating the design
		parameters for single-to-double arm transition design proposed
		by Shi and Yin (2017). The calibration is performed via
		numerical enumeration to find the optimal design that satisfies
		the constraints on the type I and II error rates.
