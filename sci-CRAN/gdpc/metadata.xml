		Generalized Dynamic Principal Components // Functions to compute
		the Generalized Dynamic Principal Components introduced in Pea
		and Yohai (2016) DOI:10.1080/01621459.2015.1072542. The
		implementation includes an automatic procedure proposed in Pea,
		Smucler and Yohai (2020) DOI:10.18637/jss.v092.c02 for the
		identification of both the number of lags to be used in the
		generalized dynamic principal components as well as the number
		of components required for a given reconstruction accuracy.
