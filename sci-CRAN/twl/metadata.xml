		Two-Way Latent Structure Clustering Model // Implementation of a
		Bayesian two-way latent structure model for integrative genomic
		clustering.  The model clusters samples in relation to distinct
		data sources, with each subject-dataset receiving a latent
		cluster label, though cluster labels have across-dataset
		meaning because of the model formulation.  A common scaling
		across data sources is unneeded, and inference is obtained by a
		Gibbs Sampler.  The model can fit multivariate Gaussian
		distributed clusters or a heavier-tailed modification of a
		Gaussian density.  Uniquely among integrative clustering
		models, the formulation makes no nestedness assumptions of
		samples across data sources -- the user can still fit the model
		if a study subject only has information from one data source.
		The package provides a variety of post-processing functions for
		model examination including ones for quantifying observed
		alignment of clusterings across genomic data sources.  Run time
		is optimized so that analyses of datasets on the order of
		thousands of features on fewer than 5 datasets and hundreds of
		subjects can converge in 1 or 2 days on a single CPU.  See
