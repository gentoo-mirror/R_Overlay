		Implementation of Unsupervised Neural Architectures //
		Implementation of several unsupervised neural networks, from
		building their architecture to their training and evaluation.
		Available networks are auto-encoders including their main
		variants: sparse, contractive, denoising, robust and
		variational, as described in Charte et al. (2018)
