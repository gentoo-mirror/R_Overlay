		File-System Toolbox for RAVE Project // Includes multiple cross-
		platform read/write interfaces for 'RAVE' project. 'RAVE'
		stands for "R analysis and visualization of human intracranial
		electroencephalography data". The whole project aims at
		providing powerful free-source package that analyze brain
		recordings from patients with electrodes placed on the cortical
		surface or inserted into the brain. 'raveio' as part of this
		project provides tools to read/write neurophysiology data
		from/to 'RAVE' file structure, as well as several popular
		formats including  'EDF(+)', 'Matlab', 'BIDS-iEEG', and 'HDF5',
		etc. Documentation and examples about 'RAVE' project are
		provided at https://openwetware.org/wiki/RAVE, and the paper by
		John F. Magnotti, Zhengjia Wang, Michael S. Beauchamp (2020)
