		Commodore Amiga File Format Handler // Modern software often
		poorly support older file formats. This package intends to
		handle many file formats that were native to the antiquated
		Commodore Amiga machine. This package focuses on file types
		from the older Amiga operating systems (= 3.0). It will read
		and write specific file formats and coerces them into more
		contemporary data.
