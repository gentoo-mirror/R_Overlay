		Logic Forest // Two classification ensemble methods based on
		logic regression models.  LogForest() uses a bagging approach
		to construct an ensemble of logic regression models.  LBoost()
		uses a combination of boosting and cross-validation to
		construct an ensemble of logic regression models.  Both methods
		are used for classification of binary responses based on binary
		predictors and for identification of important variables and
		variable interactions predictive of a binary outcome. Wolf,
