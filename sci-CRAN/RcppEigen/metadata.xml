		'Rcpp' Integration for the 'Eigen' Templated Linear Algebra
		Library // R and 'Eigen' integration using 'Rcpp'. 'Eigen' is a
		C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors,
		numerical solvers and related algorithms.  It supports dense
		and sparse matrices on integer, floating point and complex
		numbers, decompositions of such matrices, and solutions of
		linear systems. Its performance on many algorithms is
		comparable with some of the best implementations based on
		'Lapack' and level-3 'BLAS'. The 'RcppEigen' package includes
		the header files from the 'Eigen' C++ template library
		(currently version 3.3.3). Thus users do not need to install
		'Eigen' itself in order to use 'RcppEigen'. Since version
		3.1.1, 'Eigen' is licensed under the Mozilla Public License
		(version 2); earlier version were licensed under the GNU LGPL
		version 3 or later. 'RcppEigen' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to
		'Eigen') is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as
		is the rest of 'Rcpp'.
