		Evaluation of Surrogate Endpoints in Clinical Trials // In a
		clinical trial, it frequently occurs that the most credible
		outcome to evaluate the effectiveness of a new therapy (the
		true endpoint) is difficult to measure. In such a situation, it
		can be an effective strategy to replace the true endpoint by a
		(bio)marker that is easier to measure and that allows for a
		prediction of the treatment effect on the true endpoint (a
		surrogate endpoint). The package 'Surrogate' allows for an
		evaluation of the appropriateness of a candidate surrogate
		endpoint based on the meta-analytic, information-theoretic, and
		causal-inference frameworks. Part of this software has been
		developed using funding provided from the European Union's
		Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological
		development and demonstration (Grant Agreement no 602552), the
		Special Research Fund (BOF) of Hasselt University (BOF-number:
		BOF2OCPO3), GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Baekeland Mandaat
		(HBC.2022.0145), and Johnson  Johnson Innovative Medicine.
