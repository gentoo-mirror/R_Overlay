		Subgroup Identification Based on Quantitative Objectives // A
		subgroup identification method for precision medicine based on
		quantitative objectives. This method can handle continuous,
		binary and survival endpoint for both prognostic and predictive
		case. For the predictive case, the method aims at identifying a
		subgroup for which treatment is better than control by at least
		a pre-specified or auto-selected constant. For the prognostic
		case, the method aims at identifying a subgroup that is at
		least better than a pre-specified/auto-selected constant. The
		derived signature is a linear combination of predictors, and
		the selected subgroup are subjects with the signature  0. The
		false discover rate when no true subgroup exists is strictly
		controlled at a user-specified level.
