		Advanced and Fast Data Transformation // A C/C++ based package
		for advanced data transformation and statistical computing in R
		that is extremely fast, class-agnostic, and programmer friendly
		through a flexible and parsimonious syntax. It is well
		integrated with base R, 'dplyr' / (grouped) 'tibble',
		'data.table', 'sf', 'plm' (panel-series and data frames), and
		non-destructively handles other matrix or data frame based
		classes (like 'ts', 'xts' / 'zoo', 'tsibble', ...) --- Key
		Features: --- (1) Advanced statistical programming: A full set
		of fast statistical functions supporting grouped and weighted
		computations on vectors, matrices and data frames. Fast and
		programmable grouping, ordering, unique values/rows, factor
		generation and interactions. Fast and flexible functions for
		data manipulation, data object conversions, and memory
		efficient R programming. (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and
		easy multi-data-type, multi-function, weighted and parallelized
		data aggregation. (3) Advanced transformations: Fast row/column
		arithmetic, (grouped) replacing and sweeping out of statistics
		(by reference), (grouped, weighted) scaling/standardizing,
		(higher-dimensional) between (averaging) and (quasi-)within
		(demeaning) transformations, linear prediction, model fitting
		and testing exclusion restrictions. (4) Advanced time-
		computations: Fast and flexible indexed time series and panel
		data classes. Fast (sequences of) lags/leads, and
		(lagged/leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-) differences and
		(compounded) growth rates on (irregular) time series and
		panels. Multivariate auto-, partial- and cross-correlation
		functions for panel data. Panel data to (ts-)array conversions.
		(5) List processing: Recursive list search, splitting,
		extraction/subsetting, apply, and generalized row-binding /
		unlisting to data frame. (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast
		(grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed) summary statistics and
		descriptive tools.
