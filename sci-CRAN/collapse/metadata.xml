		Advanced and Fast Data Transformation // A C/C++ based package
		for advanced data transformation in R that is extremely fast,
		flexible and parsimonious to code with and programmer friendly.
		It is well integrated with 'dplyr', 'plm' and 'data.table'. ---
		Key Features: --- (1) Advanced data programming: A full set of
		fast statistical functions supporting grouped and/or weighted
		computations on vectors, matrices and data.frames. Fast
		(ordered) and reusable grouping, quick data conversions, and
		quick select, replace or add data.frame columns. (2) Advanced
		aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function,
		weighted, parallelized and fully customized data aggregation.
		(3) Advanced transformations: Fast (grouped, weighted)
		replacing and sweeping out of statistics, scaling, centering,
		higher-dimensional centering, complex linear prediction and
		partialling-out. (4) Advanced time-computations: Fast
		(sequences of) lags / leads, and (lagged / leaded, iterated)
		differences and growth rates on (unordered) time-series and
		panel data. Multivariate auto, partial and cross- correlation
		functions for panel data. Panel data to (ts-)array conversions.
		(5) List Processing: (Recursive) list search / identification,
		extraction / subsetting, data-apply, and row-binding /
		unlisting in 2D. (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped,
		weighted, panel-decomposed) summary statistics for complex
		multilevel / panel data.
