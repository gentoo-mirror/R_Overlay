		Advanced and Fast Data Transformation // A C/C++ based package
		for advanced data transformation in R that is extremely fast,
		flexible and parsimonious to code with and programmer friendly.
		It is well integrated with 'dplyr', 'plm' and 'data.table'. ---
		Key Features: --- (1) Advanced data programming: A full set of
		fast statistical functions supporting grouped and weighted
		computations on vectors, matrices and data frames. Fast
		(ordered) and programmable grouping, factor generation,
		manipulation of data frames and data object conversions. (2)
		Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-
		function, weighted, parallelized and fully customized data
		aggregation. (3) Advanced transformations: Fast (grouped,
		weighted) replacing and sweeping out of statistics, scaling /
		standardizing, centering (i.e. between and within
		transformations), higher-dimensional centering (i.e. multiple
		fixed effects transformations), linear prediction and
		partialling-out. (4) Advanced time-computations: Fast
		(sequences of) lags / leads, and (lagged / leaded, iterated,
		quasi-, log-) differences and growth rates on (unordered) time-
		series and panel data. Multivariate auto, partial and cross-
		correlation functions for panel data. Panel data to (ts-)array
		conversions. (5) List processing: (Recursive) list search /
		identification, extraction / subsetting, data-apply, and
		generalized row-binding / unlisting in 2D. (6) Advanced data
		exploration: Fast (grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed) summary
		statistics for complex multilevel / panel data.
