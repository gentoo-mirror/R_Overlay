		Advanced and Fast Data Transformation // A C/C++ based package
		for advanced data transformation and statistical computing in R
		that is extremely fast, flexible and parsimonious to code with,
		class-agnostic and programmer friendly. It is well integrated
		with base R, 'dplyr' / (grouped) 'tibble', 'data.table', 'plm'
		(panel-series and data frames), 'sf' data frames, and non-
		destructively handles other matrix or data frame based classes
		(such as 'ts', 'xts' / 'zoo', 'timeSeries', 'tsibble',
		'tibbletime' etc.) --- Key Features: --- (1) Advanced
		statistical programming: A full set of fast statistical
		functions supporting grouped and weighted computations on
		vectors, matrices and data frames. Fast and programmable
		grouping, ordering, unique values / rows, factor generation and
		interactions. Fast and flexible functions for data
		manipulation, data object conversions, and memory efficient R
		programming. (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-
		data-type, multi-function, weighted, parallelized and fully
		custom data aggregation. (3) Advanced transformations: Fast row
		/ column arithmetic, (grouped) replacing and sweeping out of
		statistics, (grouped, weighted) scaling / standardizing,
		between (averaging) and (quasi-)within (demeaning)
		transformations, higher-dimensional centering (i.e. multiple
		fixed effects or polynomials), linear prediction, model fitting
		and testing exclusion restrictions. (4) Advanced time-
		computations: Fast (sequences of) lags / leads, and (lagged /
		leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-) differences and (compounded)
		growth rates on (irregular) time series and panel data.
		Multivariate auto-, partial- and cross-correlation functions
		for panel data. Panel data to (ts-)array conversions. (5) List
		processing: (Recursive) list search, splitting, extraction /
		subsetting, data-apply, and generalized recursive row-binding /
		unlisting in 2D. (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped,
		weighted, panel-decomposed) summary statistics for complex
		multilevel / panel data.
