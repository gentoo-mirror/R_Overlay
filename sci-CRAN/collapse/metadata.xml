		Advanced and Fast Data Transformation // A C/C++ based package
		for advanced data transformation and statistical computing in R
		that is extremely fast, flexible and parsimonious to code with,
		class-agnostic and programmer friendly. It is well integrated
		with base R, 'dplyr' / (grouped) 'tibble', 'data.table', 'plm'
		(panel-series and data frames), 'sf' data frames, and non-
		destructively handles other matrix or data frame based classes
		(such as 'ts', 'xts' / 'zoo', 'timeSeries', 'tsibble',
		'tibbletime' etc.) --- Key Features: --- (1) Advanced
		statistical programming: A full set of fast statistical
		functions supporting grouped and weighted computations on
		vectors, matrices and data frames. Fast and programmable
		grouping, ordering, unique values / rows, factor generation and
		interactions. Fast and flexible functions for data manipulation
		and data object conversions. (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and
		easy multi-data-type, multi-function, weighted, parallelized
		and fully customized data aggregation. (3) Advanced
		transformations: Fast row / column arithmetic, (grouped)
		replacing and sweeping out of statistics, (grouped, weighted)
		scaling / standardizing, between (averaging) and (quasi-)within
		(centering / demeaning) transformations, higher-dimensional
		centering (i.e. multiple fixed effects transformations), linear
		prediction / partialling-out, linear model fitting and testing.
		(4) Advanced time-computations: Fast (sequences of) lags /
		leads, and (lagged / leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-)
		differences, (compounded) growth rates, and cumulative sums on
		(unordered, irregular) time series and panel data. Multivariate
		auto-, partial- and cross-correlation functions for panel data.
		Panel data to (ts-)array conversions. (5) List processing:
		(Recursive) list search / identification, splitting, extraction
		/ subsetting, data-apply, and generalized recursive row-binding
		/ unlisting in 2D. (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast
		(grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed) summary statistics for
		complex multilevel / panel data.
