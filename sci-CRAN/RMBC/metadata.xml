		Robust Model Based Clustering // A robust clustering algorithm
		(Model-Based) similar to Expectation Maximization for finite
		mixture normal distributions is implemented, its main advantage
		is that the estimator is resistant to outliers, that means that
		results of parameter estimation are still correct when there
		are atypical values in the sample (see Gonzalez, Maronna, Yohai
		and Zamar (2021) arxiv:2102.06851).
