		R to Solr Interface // A comprehensive R API for querying Apache
		Solr databases. A Solr core is represented as a data frame or
		list that supports Solr-side filtering, sorting, transformation
		and aggregation, all through the familiar base R API. Queries
		are processed lazily, i.e., a query is only sent to the
		database when the data are required.
