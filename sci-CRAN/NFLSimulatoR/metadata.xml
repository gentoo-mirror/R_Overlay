		Simulating Plays and Drives in the NFL // The intent here is to
		enable the simulation of plays/drives and evaluate game-play
		strategies in the National Football League (NFL). Built-in
		strategies include going for it on fourth down and varying the
		proportion of passing/rushing plays during a drive. The user
		should be familiar with nflscrapR data before trying to write
		his/her own strategies. This work is inspired by a blog post by
		Mike Lopez, currently the  Director of Data and Analytics at
		the NFL, Lopez (2019)
