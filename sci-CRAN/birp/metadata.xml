		Testing for Population Trends Using Low-Cost Ecological Count
		Data // A Bayesian tool to test for population trends and
		changes in trends under arbitrary designs, including before-
		after (BA), control-intervention (CI) and before-after-control-
		intervention (BACI) designs commonly used to assess
		conservation impact. It infers changes in trends jointly from
		data obtained with multiple survey methods, as well as from
		limited and noisy data not necessarily collected in
		standardized ecological surveys. Observed counts can be modeled
		as following either a Poisson or a negative binomial model, and
		both deterministic and stochastic trend models are available.
		For more details on the model see Singer et al. (2025)
		doi:10.1101/2025.01.08.631844, and the file 'AUTHORS' for a
		list of copyright holders and contributors.
