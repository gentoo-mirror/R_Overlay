		Simulate Rehabilitation Strategies for Water Distribution Systems
		// The outcome of various rehabilitation strategies for water
		distribution systems can be modeled with the Water Management
		Simulator (WaMaSim). Pipe breaks and the corresponding damage
		and rehabilitation costs are simulated. It is mainly intended
		to be used as educational tool for the Water Infrastructure
		Experimental and Computer Laboratory at ETH Zurich,
		Switzerland.
