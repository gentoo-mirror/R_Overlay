		High Performance Interface to 'GBIF' // A high performance
		interface to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility,
		'GBIF'.  In contrast to 'rgbif', which can access small subsets
		of 'GBIF' data through web-based queries to a central server,
		'gbifdb' provides enhanced performance for R users performing
		large-scale analyses on servers and cloud computing providers,
		providing full support for arbitrary 'SQL' or 'dplyr'
		operations on the complete 'GBIF' data tables (now over 1
		billion records, and over a terabyte in size). 'gbifdb'
		accesses a copy of the 'GBIF' data in 'parquet' format, which
		is already readily available in commercial computing clouds
		such as the Amazon Open Data portal and the Microsoft Planetary
		Computer, or can be accessed directly without downloading, or
		downloaded to any server with suitable bandwidth and storage
		space. The high-performance techniques for local and remote
		access are described in https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb and
		https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html respectively.
