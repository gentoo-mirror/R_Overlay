		Bindings for 'Osmium Tool' // Allows one to use 'Osmium Tool'
		(https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/) from R. 'Osmium' is a
		multipurpose command line tool that enables one to manipulate
		and analyze OpenStreetMap files through several different
		commands. Currently, this package does not aim to offer
		functions that cover the entire 'Osmium' API, instead making
		available functions that wrap only a very limited set of its
		features.
