		Exact Matching and Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC)
		// The second version (0.2.0) contains implementation for exact
		matching which is an alternative to propensity score matching
		(see Glimm  Yau (2025)). The initial version (0.1.2) contains a
		collection of easy-to-implement tools for checking whether a
		MAIC can be conducted, as well as an alternative way of
		calculating weights (see Glimm  Yau (2021)
