		System Native Font Finding // Provides system native access to
		the font catalogue. As font handling varies between systems it
		is difficult to correctly locate installed fonts across
		different operating systems. The 'systemfonts' package provides
		bindings to the native libraries on Windows, macOS and Linux
		for finding font files that can then be used further by e.g.
		graphic devices. The main use is intended to be from compiled
		code but 'systemfonts' also provides access from R.
