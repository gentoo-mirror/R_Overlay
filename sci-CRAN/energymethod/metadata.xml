		Two-Sample Test of many Functional Means using the Energy Method
		// Given two samples of size n_1 and n_2 from a data set where
		each sample consists of K functional observations (channels),
		each recorded on T grid points,  the function energy method
		implements a hypothesis test of equality of channel-wise mean
		at each channel using the bootstrapped distribution of maximum
		energy to control family wise error. The function
		energy_method_complex accomodates complex valued functional
		observations.
