		Doubly Robust Generalized Estimating Equations // Fit restricted
		mean models for the conditional association between an exposure
		and an outcome, given covariates. Three methods are
		implemented: O-estimation, where a nuisance model for the
		association between the covariates and the outcome is used;
		E-estimation where a nuisance model for the association between
		the covariates and the exposure is used, and doubly robust (DR)
		estimation where both nuisance models are used. In DR-
		estimation, the estimates will be consistent when at least one
		of the nuisance models is correctly specified, not necessarily
		both.
