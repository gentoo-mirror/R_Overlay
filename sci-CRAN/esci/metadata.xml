		Estimation Statistics with Confidence Intervals // A collection
		of functions and 'jamovi' module for the estimation approach to
		inferential statistics, the approach which emphasizes effect
		sizes, interval estimates, and meta-analysis. Nearly all
		functions are based on 'statpsych' and 'metafor'.  This package
		is still under active development, and breaking changes are
		likely, especially with the plot and hypothesis test functions.
		Data sets are included for all examples from Cumming  Calin-
		Jageman (2024) ISBN:9780367531508.
