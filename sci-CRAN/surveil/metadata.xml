		Time Series Models for Disease Surveillance // Fits time series
		models for routine disease surveillance tasks and returns
		probability distributions for a variety of quantities of
		interest, including age-standardized rates, period and
		cumulative percent change, and measures of health inequality.
		Calculates Theil's index to measure inequality among multiple
		groups, and can be extended to measure inequality across
		multiple groups nested within geographies. Inference is
		completed using Markov chain Monte Carlo via the Stan modeling
		language. The models are appropriate for count data such as
		disease incidence and mortality data, employing a Poisson or
		binomial likelihood and the first-difference (random-walk)
		prior for unknown risk. Optionally add a covariance matrix for
		multiple, correlated time series models. References: Donegan,
