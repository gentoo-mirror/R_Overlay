		A Partitioned Quasi-Likelihood for Distributed Statistical
		Inference // In the big data setting, working data sets are
		often distributed on multiple machines. However, classical
		statistical methods are often developed to solve the problems
		of single estimation or inference. We employ a novel parallel
		quasi-likelihood method in generalized linear models, to make
		the variances between different sub-estimators relatively
		similar. Estimates are obtained from projection subsets of data
		and later combined by suitably-chosen unknown weights. The
		philosophy of the package is described in Guo G. (2020)
