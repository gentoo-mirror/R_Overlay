		Analysis of Geostatistical Count Data using Gaussian Copulas //
		Provides a variety of functions to analyze and model
		geostatistical count data with Gaussian copulas, including 1)
		data simulation and visualization; 2) correlation structure
		assessment (here also known as the Normal To Anything); 3)
		calculate multivariate normal rectangle probabilities; 4)
		likelihood inference and parallel prediction at predictive
		locations. Description of the method is available from: Han and
		DeOliveira (2018) doi:10.18637/jss.v087.i13.
