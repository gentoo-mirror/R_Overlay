		Simple Dengue Test and Vaccinate Cost Thresholds // Provides the
		mathematical model described by "Serostatus Testing  Dengue
		Vaccine Cost-Benefit Thresholds" in arXiv:1904.00214.  Using
		the functions in the package, that analysis can be repeated
		using sample life histories, either synthesized from local
		seroprevalence data using other functions in this package (as
		in the manuscript) or from some other source. The package
		provides a vignette which walks through the analysis in the
		publication, as well as a function to generate a project
		skeleton for such an analysis.
