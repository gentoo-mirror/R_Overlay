		Detecting Group Disturbances from Longitudinal Observations //
		Provides an algorithm to detect and characterize disturbances
		(start, end dates, intensity) that can occur at different
		hierarchical levels by studying the dynamics of longitudinal
		observations at the unit level and group level based on
		Nadaraya-Watson's smoothing curves, but also a shiny app which
		allows to visualize the observations and the detected
		disturbances. Finally the package provides a dataframe
		mimicking a pig farming system subsected to disturbances
		simulated according to Le et al.(2022)
