		Alternative Bootstrap-Based t-Test Aiming to Reduce Type-I Error
		for Non-Negative, Zero-Inflated Data // Tu  Zhou (1999)
		doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19991030)18:20%3C2749::AID-
		SIM195%3E3.0.CO;2-C showed that comparing the means of
		populations whose data-generating distributions are non-
		negative with excess zero observations is a problem of great
		importance in the analysis of medical cost data. In the same
		study, Tu  Zhou discuss that it can be difficult to control
		type-I error rates of general-purpose statistical tests for
		comparing the means of these particular data sets. This package
		allows users to perform a modified bootstrap-based t-test that
		aims to better control type-I error rates in these situations.
