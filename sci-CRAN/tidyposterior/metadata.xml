		Bayesian Analysis to Compare Models using Resampling Statistics
		// Bayesian analysis used here to answer the question: "when
		looking at resampling results, are the differences between
		models 'real'?" To answer this, a model can be created were the
		performance statistic is the resampling statistics (e.g.
		accuracy or RMSE). These values are explained by the model
		types. In doing this, we can get parameter estimates for each
		model's affect on performance and make statistical (and
		practical) comparisons between models. The methods included
		here are similar to Benavoli et al (2017)
