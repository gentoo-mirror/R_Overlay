		Practical Significance Ranking of Regressors and Exact t Density
		// Consider a possibly nonlinear nonparametric regression with
		p regressors. We provide evaluations by 13 methods to rank
		regressors by their practical significance or importance using
		various methods, including machine learning tools.
		Comprehensive methods are as follows. m6=Generalized partial
		correlation coefficient or GPCC by Vinod
		(2021)doi:10.1007/s10614-021-10190-x and Vinod
		(2022)https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/15/1/32. m7= a
		generalization of psychologists' effect size incorporating
		nonlinearity and many variables. m8= local linear partial
		(dy/dxi) using the 'np' package for kernel regressions. m9=
		partial (dy/dxi) using the 'NNS' package. m10= importance
		measure using the 'NNS' boost function. m11= Shapley Value
		measure of importance (cooperative game theory). m12 and m13=
		two versions of the random forest algorithm. Taraldsen's exact
		density for sampling distribution of correlations added.
