		Combined Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis for Diversity
		Outbred Mice // Combined Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis
		infers predictive networks between genetic variants and
		phenotypes. It can be used with standard two-parent populations
		as well as multi-parent populations, such as the Diversity
		Outbred (DO) mice, Collaborative Cross (CC) mice, or the multi-
		parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population of
		Arabidopsis thaliana. It uses complementary information of
		pleiotropic gene variants across different phenotypes to
		resolve models of epistatic interactions between alleles. To do
		this, cape reparametrizes main effect and interaction
		coefficients from pairwise variant regressions into directed
		influence parameters. These parameters describe how alleles
		influence each other, in terms of suppression and enhancement,
		as well as how gene variants influence phenotypes. All of the
		final interactions are reported as directed interactions
		between pairs of parental alleles. For detailed descriptions of
		the methods used in this package please see the following
