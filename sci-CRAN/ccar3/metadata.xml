		Canonical Correlation Analysis via Reduced Rank Regression //
		Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) via reduced-rank
		regression with support for regularization and cross-
		validation. Several methods for estimating CCA in high-
		dimensional settings are implemented. The first set of methods,
		cca_rrr() (and variants: cca_group_rrr() and cca_graph_rrr()),
		assumes that one dataset is high-dimensional and the other is
		low-dimensional, while the second, ecca() (for Efficient CCA)
		assumes that both datasets are high-dimensional. For both
		methods, standard l1 regularization as well as group-lasso
		regularization are available. cca_graph_rrr further supports
		total variation regularization when there is a known graph
		structure among the variables of the high-dimensional dataset.
		In this case, the loadings of the canonical directions of the
		high-dimensional dataset are assumed  to be smooth on the
		graph. For more details see Donnat and Tuzhilina (2024)
