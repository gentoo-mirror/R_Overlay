		Threshold Regression for Interval-Censored Data with a Cure Rate
		Option // Fit a threshold regression model for Interval
		Censored Data based on the first-hitting-time of a boundary by
		the sample path of a Wiener diffusion process. The threshold
		regression methodology is well suited to applications involving
		survival and time-to-event data.
