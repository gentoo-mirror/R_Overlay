		Threshold Regression for Interval Censored Data with Cure-Rate or
		without Cure-Rate Model // Fit a threshold regression model for
		Interval Censored Data based on the first-hitting-time of a
		boundary by the sample path of a Wiener diffusion process. The
		threshold regression methodology is well suited to applications
		involving survival and time-to-event data.
