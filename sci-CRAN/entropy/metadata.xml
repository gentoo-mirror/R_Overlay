		Estimation of Entropy, Mutual Information and Related Quantities
		// Implements various estimators of entropy for discrete random
		variables, including the shrinkage estimator by Hausser and
		Strimmer (2009), the maximum likelihood and the Millow-Madow
		estimator, various Bayesian estimators, and the Chao-Shen
		estimator.  It also offers an R interface to the NSB estimator.
		Furthermore, the package provides functions for estimating the
		Kullback-Leibler divergence, the chi-squared divergence, mutual
		information, and the chi-squared divergence of independence.
		It also computes the G statistic and the chi-squared statistic
		and corresponding p-values. Furthermore, there are functions
		for discretizing continuous random variables.
