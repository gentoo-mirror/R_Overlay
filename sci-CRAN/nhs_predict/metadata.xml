		Breast Cancer Survival and Therapy Benefits // Calculate Overall
		Survival or Recurrence-Free Survival for breast cancer
		patients, using 'NHS Predict'. The time interval for the
		estimation can be set up to 15 years, with default at 10.
		Incremental therapy benefits are estimated for hormone therapy,
		chemotherapy, trastuzumab, and bisphosphonates. An additional
		function, suited for SCAN audits, features a more user-friendly
		version of the code, with fewer inputs, but necessitates the
		correct standardised inputs. This work is not affiliated with
		the development of 'NHS Predict' and its underlying statistical
		model. Details on 'NHS Predict' can be found at:
		doi:10.1186/bcr2464. The web version of 'NHS Predict':
		https://breast.predict.nhs.uk/. A small dataset of 50 fictional
		patient observations is provided for the purpose of running
		examples with the main two functions, and an additional dataset
		is provided for running example with the dedicated SCAN
		function.
