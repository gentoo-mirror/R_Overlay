		Visualizing and Quantifying Space Use Data for Groups of Animals
		// Offers an easy and automated way to scale up individual-
		level space use analysis to that of groups. Contains a function
		from the 'move' package to calculate a dynamic Brownian bridge
		movement model from movement data for individual animals, as
		well as functions to visualize and quantify space use for
		individuals aggregated in groups. Originally written with
		passive acoustic telemetry in mind, this package also provides
		functionality to account for unbalanced acoustic receiver array
		designs, and satellite tag data.
