		Easy Handling Discrete Time Markov Chains // Functions and S4
		methods to create and manage discrete time Markov chains more
		easily. In addition functions to perform statistical (fitting
		and drawing random variates) and probabilistic (analysis of
		their structural proprieties) analysis are provided. See
		Spedicato (2017) doi:10.32614/RJ-2017-036. Some functions for
		continuous times Markov chains depends on the suggested ctmcd
		package, that, as May 2023, can be retrieved from https://cran.
		r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ctmcd/ctmcd_1.4.2.tar.gz.
