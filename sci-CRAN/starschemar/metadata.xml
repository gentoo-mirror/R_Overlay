		Obtaining Star Schemas from Flat Tables // Data in
		multidimensional systems is obtained from operational systems
		and is transformed to adapt it to the new structure.
		Frequently, the operations to be performed aim to transform a
		flat table into a star schema. Transformations can be carried
		out using professional ETL (extract, transform and load) tools
		or tools intended for data transformation for end users. With
		the tools mentioned, this transformation can be carried out,
		but it requires a lot of work. The main objective this package
		is to define transformations that allow obtaining star schemas
		from flat tables easily. In addition, it includes basic data
		cleaning, dimension enrichment, incremental data refresh and
		query operations, adapted to this context.
