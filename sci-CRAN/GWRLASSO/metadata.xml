		A Hybrid Model for Spatial Prediction Through Local Regression //
		It implements a hybrid spatial model for improved spatial
		prediction by combining the variable selection capability of
		LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) with
		the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model that
		captures the spatially varying relationship efficiently. For
		method details see, Wheeler, D.C.(2009).DOI:10.1068/a40256. The
		developed hybrid model efficiently selects the relevant
		variables by using LASSO as the first step; these selected
		variables are then incorporated into the GWR framework,
		allowing the estimation of spatially varying regression
		coefficients at unknown locations and finally predicting the
		values of the response variable at unknown test locations while
		taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of the data.
		Integrating the LASSO and GWR models enhances prediction
		accuracy by considering spatial heterogeneity and capturing the
		local relationships between the predictors and the response
		variable. The developed hybrid spatial model can be useful for
		spatial modeling, especially in scenarios involving complex
		spatial patterns and large datasets with multiple predictor
		variables.
