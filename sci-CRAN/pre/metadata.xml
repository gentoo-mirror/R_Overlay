		Prediction Rule Ensembles // Derives prediction rule ensembles
		(PREs). Largely follows the procedure for deriving PREs as
		described in Friedman  Popescu (2008; DOI:10.1214/07-AOAS148),
		with several adjustments and improvements. The main function
		pre() derives prediction rule ensembles consisting of rules
		and/or linear terms for binary, count and continuous responses.
		Function gpe() derives generalized prediction ensembles,
		consisting of rules, hinge and linear functions of the
		predictor variables.
