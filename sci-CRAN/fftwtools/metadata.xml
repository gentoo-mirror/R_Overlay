		Wrapper for FFTW3: Includes 1-D, Univariate and Multivariate, and
		2-D Transform // Provides a wrapper for several FFTW functions.
		This package provides access to the two-dimensional FFT, the
		multivariate FFT, and the one-dimensional real to complex FFT
		using FFTW3. The package includes the functions fftw and mvfftw
		which are designed to mimic the functionality of the R
		functions fft and mvfft. The FFT functions have a parameter
		that allows them to not return the redundant complex conjugate
		when the input is real data.
