		Method Comparison Regression - Mcr Fork for M- And MM-Deming
		Regression // Regression methods to quantify the relation
		between two measurement methods are provided by this package.
		In particular it addresses regression problems with errors in
		both variables and without repeated measurements. It implements
		the Clinical Laboratory Standard International (CLSI)
		recommendations (see J. A. Budd et al. (2018,
		https://clsi.org/standards/products/method-
		evaluation/documents/ep09/) for analytical method comparison
		and bias estimation using patient samples. Furthermore,
		algorithms for Theil-Sen and equivariant Passing-Bablok
		estimators are implemented, see F. Dufey (2020,
		doi:10.1515/ijb-2019-0157) and J. Raymaekers and F. Dufey
		(2022, arXiv:2202:08060). Further the robust M-Deming and MM-
		Deming (experimental) are available, see G. Pioda (2021,
		arXiv:2105:04628). A comprehensive overview over the
		implemented methods and references can be found in the manual
		pages 'mcrPioda-package' and 'mcreg'.
