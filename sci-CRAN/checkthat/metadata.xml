		Intuitive Unit Testing Tools for Data Manipulation // Provides a
		lightweight data validation and testing toolkit for R. Its
		guiding philosophy is that adding code-based data checks to
		users' existing workflow should be both quick and intuitive.
		The suite of functions included therefore mirror the common
		data checks many users already perform by hand or by eye.
		Additionally, the 'checkthat' package is optimized to work
		within 'tidyverse' data manipulation pipelines.
