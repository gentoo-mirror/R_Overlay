		Estimation of Life Expectancies Using Multi-State Models //
		Functions to compute state-specific and marginal life
		expectancies. The computation is based on a fitted continuous-
		time multi-state model that includes an absorbing death state;
		see Van den Hout (2017, ISBN:9781466568402). The fitted multi-
		state model model should be estimated using the 'msm' package
		using age as the time-scale.
