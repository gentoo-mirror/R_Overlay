		Bayesian Methods for Optimal Threshold Estimation // Functions to
		estimate the optimal threshold of diagnostic markers or
		treatment selection markers. The optimal threshold is the
		marker value that maximizes the utility of the marker based-
		strategy (for diagnostic or treatment selection) in a given
		population. The utility function depends on the type of marker
		(diagnostic or treatment selection), but always takes into
		account the preferences of the patients or the physician in the
		decision process. For estimating the optimal threshold, ones
		must specify the distributions of the marker in different
		groups (defined according to the type of marker, diagnostic or
		treatment selection) and provides data to estimate the
		parameters of these distributions. Ones must also provide some
		features of the target populations (disease prevalence or
		treatment efficacies) as well as the preferences of patients or
		physicians. The functions rely on Bayesian inference which
		helps producing several indicators derived from the optimal
		threshold. See Blangero, Y, Rabilloud, M, Ecochard, R, and
		Subtil, F (2019) doi:10.1177/0962280218821394 for the original
		article that describes the estimation method for treatment
		selection markers and Subtil, F, and Rabilloud, M (2019)
		doi:10.1002/bimj.200900242 for diagnostic markers.
