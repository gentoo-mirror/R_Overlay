		Single Cell Feature Identification with Network Topology //
		Cluster-independent method based on topology structure of gene
		co-expression network for identifying feature gene sets,
		extracting cellular subpopulations, and elucidating intrinsic
		relationships among these subpopulations. Without prior cell
		clustering, SifiNet circumvents potential inaccuracies in
		clustering that may influence subsequent analyses. This method
		is introduced in Qi Gao, Zhicheng Ji, Liuyang Wang, Kouros
		Owzar, Qi-Jing Li, Cliburn Chan, Jichun Xie "SifiNet: a robust
		and accurate method to identify feature gene sets and annotate
		cells" (2024) doi:10.1093/nar/gkae307.
