		Fast Raster Summary and Manipulation // Fast alternatives to
		several relatively slow 'raster' package functions. For large
		rasters, the functions run from 5 to approximately 100 times
		faster than the 'raster' package functions they replace. The
		'fasterize' package, on which one function in this package
		depends, includes an implementation of the scan line algorithm
		attributed to Wylie et al. (1967) doi:10.1145/1465611.1465619.
