		Model Based Bio-Equivalence // Uses several Nonlinear Mixed
		effect (NONMEM) models (as NONMEM control files) to perform
		bootstrap model averaging and Monte Carlo Simulation for Model
		Based Bio-Equivalence (MBBE). Power is returned as the fraction
		of the simulations with successful bioequivalence (BE) test,
		for maximum concentration (Cmax), Area under the curve to the
		last observed value (AUClast) and Area under the curve
		extrapolate to infinity (AUCinf). See Hooker, A. (2020)
		Improved bioequivalence assessment through model-informed and
		model-based strategies
