		Vegetation and Spectral Indices for Environmental Assessment //
		Earth system dynamics, such as plant dynamics, water bodies,
		and fire regimes, are widely monitored using spectral
		indicators obtained from multispectral remote sensing products.
		There is a great need for spectral index catalogues and
		computing tools as a result of the quick rise of suggested
		spectral indices. Unfortunately, the majority of these
		resources lack a standard Application Programming Interface,
		are out-of-date, closed-source, or are not linked to a
		catalogue. We now introduce 'VegSpecIndex', a standardised list
		of spectral indices for studies of the earth system. A thorough
		inventory of spectral indices is offered by 'VegSpecIndex' and
		is connected to an R library. For every spectral index,
		'VegSpecIndex' provides a comprehensive collection of
		information, such as names, formulae, and source references.
		The user community may add more items to the catalogue, which
		will keep 'VegSpecIndex' up to date and allow for further
		scientific uses. Additionally, the R library makes it possible
		to apply the catalogue to actual data, which makes it easier to
		employ remote sensing resources effectively across a variety of
		Earth system domains.
