		Bayesian Augmented Control for Clinical Trials // Implements the
		Bayesian Augmented Control (BAC, a.k.a. Bayesian historical
		data borrowing) method under clinical trial setting by calling
		'Just Another Gibbs Sampler' ('JAGS') software. In addition,
		the 'BACCT' package evaluates user-specified decision rules by
		computing the type-I error/power, or probability of correct
		go/no-go decision at interim look. The evaluation can be
		presented numerically or graphically. Users need to have 'JAGS'
		4.0.0 or newer installed due to a compatibility issue with
		'rjags' package. Currently, the package implements the BAC
		method for binary outcome only. Support for continuous and
		survival endpoints will be added in future releases. We would
		like to thank AbbVie's Statistical Innovation group and
		Clinical Statistics group for their support in developing the
		'BACCT' package.
