		Graphical Aid in Correspondence Analysis Interpretation and
		Significance Testings // Allows to plot a number of information
		related to the interpretation of Correspondence Analysis'
		results. It provides the facility to plot the contribution of
		rows and columns categories to the principal dimensions, the
		quality of points display on selected dimensions, the
		correlation of row and column categories to selected
		dimensions, etc. It also allows to assess which dimension(s) is
		important for the data structure interpretation by means of
		different statistics and tests. The package also offers the
		facility to plot the permuted distribution of the table total
		inertia as well as of the inertia accounted for by pairs of
		selected dimensions. Different facilities are also provided
		that aim to produce interpretation-oriented scatterplots.
