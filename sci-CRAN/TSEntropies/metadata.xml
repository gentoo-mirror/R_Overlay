		Time Series Entropies // Computes various entropies of given time
		series. This is the initial version that includes ApEn() and
		SampEn() functions for calculating approximate entropy and
		sample entropy. Approximate entropy was proposed by S.M. Pincus
		in "Approximate entropy as a measure of system complexity",
		Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United
		States of America, 88, 2297-2301 (March 1991). Sample entropy
		was proposed by J. S. Richman and J. R. Moorman in
		"Physiological time-series analysis using approximate entropy
		and sample entropy", American Journal of Physiology, Heart and
		Circulatory Physiology, 278, 2039-2049 (June 2000). This
		package also contains FastApEn() and FastSampEn() functions for
		calculating fast approximate entropy and fast sample entropy.
		These are newly designed very fast algorithms, resulting from
		the modification of the original algorithms. The calculated
		values of these entropies are not the same as the original
		ones, but the entropy trend of the analyzed time series
		determines equally reliably. Their main advantage is their
		speed, which is up to a thousand times higher. A scientific
		article describing their properties has been submitted to The
		Journal of Supercomputing and in present time it is waiting for
		the acceptance.
