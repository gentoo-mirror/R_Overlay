		Time Series Outlier Detection // Time series outlier detection
		with non parametric test. This is a new outlier detection
		methodology (washer): efficient for time saving elaboration and
		implementation procedures, adaptable for general assumptions
		and for needing very short time series, reliable and effective
		as involving robust non parametric test. You can find two
		approaches: single time series (a vector) and grouped time
		series (a data frame). For other informations: Andrea Venturini
		(2011) Statistica - Universita di Bologna, Vol.71, pp.329-344.
		For an informal explanation look at R-bloggers on web.
