		An Framework for Reducing Elemental LAICPMS Data from Solid
		Structures // Aims to facilitate the reduction of elemental
		microchemistry data from solid-phase LAICPMS analysis (laser
		ablation inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry). The
		'elementR' package provides a reactive and user friendly
		interface (based on a 'shiny' application) and a set of 'R6'
		classes for conducting all steps needed for an optimal data
		reduction while leaving maximum control for user.
