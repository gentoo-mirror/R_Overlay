		Interface to NetCDF Datasets // An interface to the NetCDF file
		format designed by Unidata for efficient storage of array-
		oriented scientific data and descriptions. The R interface is
		closely based on the C API of the NetCDF library, and it
		includes calendar conversions from the Unidata UDUNITS library.
		The current implementation supports all operations on NetCDF
		datasets in classic and 64-bit offset file formats, and
		NetCDF4-classic format is supported for reading and
		modification of existing files.
