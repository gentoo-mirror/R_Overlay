		Inferring Developmental Chronologies from Single-Cell RNA
		Sequencing Data // An accurate and easy tool for performing
		linear trajectory inference on single cells using single-cell
		RNA sequencing data. In addition, SCORPIUS provides functions
		for discovering the most important genes with respect to the
		reconstructed trajectory, as well as nice visualisation tools.
