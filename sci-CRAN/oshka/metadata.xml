		Recursive Quoted Language Expansion // Expands quoted language by
		recursively replacing any symbol that points to quoted language
		with the language it points to.  The recursive process
		continues until only symbols that point to non-language objects
		remain.  The resulting quoted language can then be evaluated
		normally.  This differs from the traditional 'quote'/'eval'
		pattern because it resolves intermediate language objects that
		would interfere with evaluation.
