		Fast Adaptive Spectral Clustering for Single and Multi-View Data
		// A self-tuning spectral clustering method for single or
		multi-view data. 'Spectrum' uses a new type of adaptive density
		aware kernel that strengthens local connections in the graph.
		For integrating multi-view data and reducing noise a tensor
		product graph data integration and diffusion procedure is used.
		'Spectrum' analyses eigenvector variance or distribution to
		determine the number of clusters. 'Spectrum' is well suited for
		a wide range of data, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian
		structures.
