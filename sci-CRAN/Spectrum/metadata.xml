		Versatile Ultra-Fast Spectral Clustering for Single and Multi-
		View Data // A versatile ultra-fast spectral clustering method
		for single or multi-view data. 'Spectrum' uses a new type of
		adaptive density aware kernel that strengthens local
		connections in dense regions in the graph. For integrating
		multi-view data and reducing noise we use a recently developed
		tensor product graph data integration and diffusion system.
		'Spectrum' contains two techniques for finding the number of
		clusters (K); the classical eigengap method and a novel
		multimodality gap procedure. The multimodality gap analyses the
		distribution of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to
		decide K and tune the kernel. 'Spectrum' is suited for
		clustering a wide range of complex data.
