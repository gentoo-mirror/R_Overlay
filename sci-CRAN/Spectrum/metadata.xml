		Fast Adaptive Spectral Clustering for Single and Multi-View Data
		// A self-tuning spectral clustering method for single or
		multi-view data. 'Spectrum' uses a new type of adaptive density
		aware kernel that strengthens local connections in the graph.
		It uses a tensor product graph data integration and diffusion
		procedure to integrate different data sources and reduce noise.
		'Spectrum' uses either the eigengap or multimodality gap
		heuristics to determine the number of clusters. The method is
		sufficiently flexible so that a wide range of Gaussian and non-
		Gaussian structures can be clustered with automatic selection
		of K.
