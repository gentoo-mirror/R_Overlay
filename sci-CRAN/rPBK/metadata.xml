		Inference and Prediction of Generic Physiologically-Based Kinetic
		Models // Fit and simulate any kind of physiologically-based
		kinetic ('PBK') models whatever the number of compartments.
		Moreover, it allows to account for any link between pairs of
		compartments, as well as any link of each of the compartments
		with the external medium. Such generic PBK models have today
		applications in pharmacology (PBPK models) to describe drug
		effects, in toxicology and ecotoxicology (PBTK models) to
		describe chemical substance effects. In case of exposure to a
		parent compound (drug or chemical) the 'rPBK' package allows to
		consider metabolites, whatever their number and their phase (I,
		II, ...). Last but not least, package 'rPBK' can also be used
		for dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) to deal with metabolic
		networks. See also Charles et al. (2022)
