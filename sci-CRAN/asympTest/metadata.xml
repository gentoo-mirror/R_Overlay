		A Simple R Package for Classical Parametric Statistical Tests and
		Confidence Intervals in Large Samples // One and two sample
		mean and variance tests (differences and ratios) are
		considered. The test statistics are all expressed in the same
		form as the Student t-test, which facilitates their
		presentation in the classroom. This contribution also fills the
		gap of a robust (to non-normality) alternative to the chi-
		square single variance test for large samples, since no such
		procedure is implemented in standard statistical software.
