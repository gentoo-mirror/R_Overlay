		Calculates Safety Stopping Boundaries for a Single-Arm Trial
		using Bayes // Computation of stopping boundaries for a single-
		arm trial using a Bayesian criterion; i.e., for each m=n (n=
		total patient number of the trial) the smallest number of
		observed toxicities is calculated leading to the termination of
		the trial/accrual according to the specified criteria. The
		probabilities of stopping the trial/accrual at and up until
		(resp.) the m-th patient (m=n) is also calculated. This design
		is more conservative than the frequentist approach (using
		Clopper Pearson CIs) which might be preferred as it concerns
		safety.See also Aamot et.al.(2010) "Continuous monitoring of
		toxicity in clinical trials - simulating the risk of stopping
		prematurely" doi:10.5414/cpp48476.
