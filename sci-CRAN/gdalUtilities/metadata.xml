		Wrappers for 'GDAL' Utilities Executables // R's 'sf' package
		ships with self-contained 'GDAL' executables, including a bare
		bones interface to several 'GDAL'-related utility programs
		collectively known as the 'GDAL utilities'. For each of those
		utilities, this package provides an R wrapper whose formal
		arguments closely mirror those of the 'GDAL' command line
		interface. The utilities operate on data stored in files and
		typically write their output to other files. Therefore, to
		process data stored in any of R's more common spatial formats
		(i.e. those supported by the 'sp', 'sf', and 'raster'
		packages), first write them to disk, then process them with the
		package's wrapper functions before reading the outputted
		results back into R. GDAL function arguments introduced in GDAL
		version 3.2.1 or earlier are supported.
