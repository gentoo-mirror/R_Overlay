		Perform the Complete Processing of a Set of Proton Nuclear
		Magnetic Resonance Spectra // Perform the complete processing
		of a set of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra from the
		free induction decay (raw data) and based on a processing
		sequence (macro-command file). An additional file specifies all
		the spectra to be considered by associating their sample code
		as well as the levels of experimental factors to which they
		belong. More detail can be found in Jacob et al. (2017)
