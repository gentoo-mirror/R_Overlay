		Fast Mutual Information Based Independence Test // A mutual
		information estimator based on k-nearest neighbor method
		proposed by A. Kraskov, et al. (2004)
		doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066138 to measure general dependence
		and the time complexity for our estimator is only squared to
		the sample size, which is faster than other statistics.
		Besides, an implementation of mutual information based
		independence test is provided for analyzing multivariate data
		in Euclidean space (T B. Berrett, et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asz024); furthermore, we extend it to tackle
		datasets in metric spaces.
