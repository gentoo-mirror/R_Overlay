		Query Composite Hypotheses // Provides functions for the joint
		analysis of Q sets of p-values obtained for the same list of
		items. This joint analysis is performed by querying a composite
		hypothesis, i.e. an arbitrary complex combination of simple
		hypotheses, as described in Mary-Huard et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab592 and De Walsche et al.(2023)
		doi:10.1101/2024.03.17.585412. In this approach, the Q-uplet of
		p-values associated with each item is distributed as a
		multivariate mixture, where each of the 2^Q components
		corresponds to a specific combination of simple hypotheses. The
		dependence between the p-value series is considered using a
		Gaussian copula function. A p-value for the composite
		hypothesis test is derived from the posterior probabilities.
