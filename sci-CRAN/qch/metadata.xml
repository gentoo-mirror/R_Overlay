		Query Composed Hypotheses // Provides functions for the joint
		analysis of K sets of p-values obtained for a same list of
		items. This joint analysis is performed by querying a composed
		hypothesis, i.e. an arbitrary complex combination of simple
		hypotheses, as described in Mary-Huard et al. (2021)
		arXiv:2104.14601. The null distribution corresponding to the
		composed hypothesis of interest is obtained by fitting non-
		parametric mixtures models (one for each of the simple
		hypothesis of the complex combination). Type I error rate
		control is achieved through Bayesian False Discovery Rate
		control.  The 3 main functions of the package GetHinfo(),
		qch.fit() and qch.test() correspond to the 3 steps for querying
		a composed hypothesis (composed H0/H1 formulation, inferring
		the null distribution and testing the null hypothesis).
