		Binary and Categorical Image Similarity Index // Computes a
		structural similarity metric (after the style of MS-SSIM for
		images) for binary and categorical 2D and 3D images. Can be
		based on accuracy (simple matching), Cohen's kappa, Rand index,
		adjusted Rand index, Jaccard index, Dice index, normalized
		mutual information, or adjusted mutual information. In
		addition, has fast computation of Cohen's kappa, the Rand
		indices, and the two mutual informations. Implements the
		methods of Thompson and Maitra (2020) arXiv:2004.09073.
