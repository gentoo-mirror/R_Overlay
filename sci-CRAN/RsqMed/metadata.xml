		Total Mediation Effect Size Measure for High-Dimensional
		Mediators // An implementation of calculating the R-squared
		measure as a total mediation effect size measure and its
		confidence interval for moderate- or high-dimensional mediator
		models. It gives an option to filter out non-mediators using
		variable selection methods. The original R package is directly
		related to the paper Yang et al (2021) "Estimation of mediation
		effect for high-dimensional omics mediators with application to
		the Framingham Heart Study" doi:10.1101/774877. The new version
		contains a choice of using cross-fitting, which is
		computationally faster. The details of the cross-fitting method
		are available in the paper Xu et al (2023) "Speeding up
		interval estimation for R2-based mediation effect of high-
		dimensional mediators via cross-fitting"
		doi:10.1101/2023.02.06.527391.
