		Total Mediation Effect Size Measure (R-Squared Measure) under
		Moderate or High-Dimensional Mediator Settings // An
		implementation of calculating the R-squared measure as a total
		mediation effect size measure and its confidence interval for
		moderate- or high-dimensional mediator model. It gives an
		option to filter out non-mediators using variable selection
		method. This R package is directly related to the paper
		"Estimation of mediation effect for high-dimensional omics
		mediators with application to the Framingham Heart Study" with
		doi:10.1101/774877.
