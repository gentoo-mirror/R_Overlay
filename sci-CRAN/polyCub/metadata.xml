		Cubature over Polygonal Domains // Numerical integration of
		continuously differentiable functions f(x,y) over simple closed
		polygonal domains. The following cubature methods are
		implemented: product Gauss cubature (Sommariva and Vianello,
		2007, doi:10.1007/s10543-007-0131-2), the simple two-
		dimensional midpoint rule (wrapping 'spatstat.geom' functions),
		adaptive cubature for radially symmetric functions via line
		integrate() along the polygon boundary (Meyer and Held, 2014,
		doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743, Supplement B), and integration of the
		bivariate Gaussian density based on polygon triangulation. For
		simple integration along the axes, the 'cubature' package is
		more appropriate.
