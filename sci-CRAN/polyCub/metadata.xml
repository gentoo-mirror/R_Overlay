		Cubature over Polygonal Domains // The following methods for
		cubature (numerical integration) over polygonal domains are
		currently implemented: the two-dimensional midpoint rule as a
		simple wrapper around as.im.function() from package 'spatstat'
		(Baddeley and Turner, 2005), the product Gauss cubature by
		Sommariva and Vianello (2007), an adaptive cubature for
		isotropic functions via line integrate() along the boundary
		(Meyer and Held, 2014), and quasi-exact methods specific to the
		integration of the bivariate Gaussian density over polygonal
		and circular domains (based on formulae from the Abramowitz and
		Stegun (1972) handbook). For cubature over simple hypercubes,
		the packages 'cubature' and 'R2Cuba' are more appropriate.
