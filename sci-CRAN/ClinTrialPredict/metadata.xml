		Predicting and Simulating Clinical Trial with Time-to-Event
		Endpoint // Predict the course of clinical trial with a time-
		to-event endpoint for both two-arm and single-arm design. Each
		of the four primary study design parameters (the expected
		number of observed events, the number of subjects enrolled, the
		observation time, and the censoring parameter) can be derived
		analytically given the other three parameters. And the
		simulation datasets can be generated based on the design
		settings.
