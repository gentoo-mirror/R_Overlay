		Functions for Working with Two- And Four-Parameter Beta
		Probability Distributions // Package providing a number of
		functions for working with Two- and Four-parameter Beta and
		closely related distributions (i.e., the Gamma and Binomial
		distributions), including parameterization in terms of moments,
		and fitting of Beta distributions to vectors of values. Also
		includes functions for estimating classification accuracy,
		diagnostic performance, and consistency, making use of what is
		generally known as the 'Livingston and Lewis approach' in the
		psychometric literature as the foundational method, which makes
		extensive use of the Beta distribution. A shiny app is
		available, providing a GUI for the Livingston and Lewis
		approach for binary classifications. For link, see
		documentation for the LL.CA() function. Livingston and Lewis
