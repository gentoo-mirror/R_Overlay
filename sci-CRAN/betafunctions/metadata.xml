		Functions for Working with Two- And Four-Parameter Beta
		Probability Distributions // Package providing a number of
		functions for working with Two- and Four-parameter Beta
		distributions, including alternative parameterizations,
		calculation of moments, and fitting of Beta distributions to
		vectors of values. Also includes functions for estimating
		classification accuracy, diagnostic performance and
		consistency, using what is generally known as the "Livingston
		and Lewis approach" in the psychometric literature as the
		foundational method, which makes extensive use of the Beta
		distribution. A shiny application is now online, providing a
		GUI for the Livingston and Lewis approach. See documentation
		for LL.CA() function. Livingston and Lewis (1995)
