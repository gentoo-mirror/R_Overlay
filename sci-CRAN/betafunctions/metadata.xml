		Functions for Working with Two- And Four-Parameter Beta
		Probability Distributions // Package providing a number of
		functions for working with Two- and Four-parameter Beta and
		closely related distributions (i.e., the Gamma- Binomial-, and
		Beta-Binomial distributions), including parameterization in
		terms of moments, and fitting of Beta distributions to vectors
		of values. Includes d/p/r- and a function and for calculating
		moments of Beta-Binomial distributions. Also includes functions
		for estimating classification accuracy, diagnostic performance,
		and consistency, making use of what is generally known as the
		'Livingston and Lewis approach' in the psychometric literature
		which models observed-score distributions in terms of the Beta-
		Binomial distribution. A shiny app is available, providing a
		GUI for the Livingston and Lewis approach when used for binary
		classifications. For url to the app, see documentation for the
		LL.CA() function. Livingston and Lewis (1995)
