		Functions for Working with Two- And Four-Parameter Beta
		Probability Distributions and Psychometric Analysis of
		Classifications // Package providing a number of functions for
		working with Two- and Four-parameter Beta and closely related
		distributions (i.e., the Gamma- Binomial-, and Beta-Binomial
		distributions). Includes, among other things: - d/p/q/r
		functions for Four-Parameter Beta distributions and Generalized
		"Binomial" (continuous) distributions, and d/p/r- functions for
		Beta- Binomial distributions. - Moment generating functions for
		Binomial distributions, Beta-Binomial distributions, and
		observed value distributions. - Functions for estimating
		classification accuracy and consistency, making use of the
		Classical Test-Theory based 'Livingston and Lewis' (LL) and
		'Hanson and Brennan' approaches. A shiny app is available,
		providing a GUI for the LL approach when used for binary
		classifications. For url to the app, see documentation for the
		LL.CA() function. Livingston and Lewis (1995)
