		Elliptical Symmetry Tests // Given the omnipresence of the
		assumption of elliptical symmetry, it is essential to be able
		to test whether that assumption actually holds true or not for
		the data at hand. This package provides several statistical
		tests for elliptical symmetry that are described in Babic et
		al. (2020) arXiv:2011.12560.
