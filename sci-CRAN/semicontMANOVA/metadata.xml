		Multivariate ANalysis of VAriance with Ridge Regularization for
		Semicontinuous High-Dimensional Data // Implements Multivariate
		ANalysis Of VAriance (MANOVA) parameters' inference and test
		with regularization for semicontinuous high-dimensional data.
		The method can be applied also in presence of low-dimensional
		data. The p-value can be obtained through asymptotic
		distribution or using a permutation procedure. The package
		gives also the possibility to simulate this type of data.
		Method is described in Elena Sabbioni, Claudio Agostinelli and
		Alessio Farcomeni (2024) arXiv:2401.04036.
