		Patterns and Statistical Differences Between Two Groups of
		Strings // Methods include converting series of event names to
		strings, finding common patterns in a group of strings,
		discovering featured patterns when comparing two groups of
		strings as well as the number and starting position of each
		pattern in each string, obtaining transition matrix, computing
		transition entropy, statistically comparing the difference
		between two groups of strings, and clustering string groups.
		Event names can be any action names or labels such as events in
		log files or areas of interest (AOIs) in eye tracking research.
