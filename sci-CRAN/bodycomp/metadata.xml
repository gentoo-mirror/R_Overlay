		Percent Body Fat Values Using Anthropometric Prediction Equations
		// Skinfold measurements is one of the most popular and
		practical methods for estimating percent body fat. Body
		composition is a term that describes the relative proportions
		of fat, bone, and muscle mass in the human body. Following the
		collection of skinfold measurements, regression analysis (a
		statistical procedure used to predict a dependent variable
		based on one or more independent or predictor variables) is
		used to estimate total percent body fat in humans.
