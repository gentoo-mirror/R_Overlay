		in Cancer) // A data package with 2 main package variables:
		'signature' and 'etiology'. The 'signature' variable contains
		the latest mutational signature profiles released on COSMIC
		https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/ for 4 mutation types: *
		single base substitutions in the context of preceding and
		following bases, * Strand bias single base substitutions:
		single base substitutions from transcribed regions, that take
		into consideration the the transcribed versus non-transcribed
		strand, * Doublet base substitutions, and * Small insertions
		and deletions. The 'etiology' variable provides the known or
		hypothesized causes of signatures. 'cosmicsig' stands for
		COSMIC signatures. Please run ?'cosmicsig' for more
