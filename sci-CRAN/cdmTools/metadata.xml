		Useful Tools for Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling // Provides useful
		tools for cognitive diagnosis modeling (CDM). The package
		includes functions for empirical Q-matrix estimation and
		validation, such as the Hull method (Njera, Sorrel, de la
		Torre,  Abad, 2021, doi:10.1111/bmsp.12228) and the discrete
		factor loading method (Wang, Song,  Ding, 2018,
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-77249-3_29). It also contains
		dimensionality assessment procedures for CDM, including
		parallel analysis and automated fit comparison as explored in
		Njera, Abad, and Sorrel (2021, doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2021.614470).
		Other relevant methods and features for CDM applications, such
		as the restricted DINA model (Njera et al., 2023), the general
		nonparametric classification method (Chiu et al., 2018;
		doi:10.1007/s11336-017-9595-4), and corrected estimation of the
		classification accuracy via multiple imputation (Kreitchmann et
		al., 2022; doi:10.3758/s13428-022-01967-5) are also available.
		Lastly, the package provides some useful functions for CDM
		simulation studies, such as random Q-matrix generation and
		detection of complete/identified Q-matrices.
