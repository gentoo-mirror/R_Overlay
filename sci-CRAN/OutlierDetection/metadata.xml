		detection (Hautamaki, V., Karkkainen, I., and Franti, P. 2004
		http://cs.uef.fi/~franti/papers.html), dispersion based outlier
		detection (Jin, W., Tung, A., and Han, J. 2001
		https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-25465-X_7),
		depth based outlier detection (Johnson, T., Kwok, I., and Ng,
		R.T. 1998 http://www.aaai.org/Library/KDD/1998/kdd98-038.php)
		and density based outlier detection (Ester, M., Kriegel, H.-P.,
