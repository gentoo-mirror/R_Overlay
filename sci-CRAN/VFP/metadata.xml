		Variance Function Program // Variance function estimation for
		models proposed by W. Sadler in his variance function program
		('VFP', www.aacb.asn.au/AACB/Resources/Variance-Function-
		Program). Here, the idea is to fit multiple variance functions
		to a data set and consequently assess which function reflects
		the relationship 'Var ~ Mean' best. For 'in-vitro diagnostic'
		('IVD') assays modeling this relationship is of great
		importance when individual test-results are used for defining
		follow-up treatment of patients.
