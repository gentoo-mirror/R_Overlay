		Variance Function Program // Variance function estimation for
		models proposed by W. Sadler in his variance function program
		('VFP', http://www.aacb.asn.au/resources/useful-tools/variance-
		function-program-v14). Here, the idea is to fit multiple
		variance functions to a data set and consequently assess which
		function reflects the relationship 'Var ~ Mean' best. For 'in-
		vitro diagnostic' ('IVD') assays modeling this relationship is
		of great importance when individual test-results are used for
		defining follow-up treatment of patients.
