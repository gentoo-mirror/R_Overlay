		Genome-Wide Regression P-Value (Gwrpv) // Computes the sample
		probability value (p-value) for the estimated coefficient from
		a standard genome-wide univariate regression.  It computes the
		exact finite-sample p-value under the assumption that the
		measured phenotype (the dependent variable in the regression)
		has a known Bernoulli-normal mixture distribution. Finite-
		sample genome-wide regression p-values (Gwrpv) with a non-
		normally distributed phenotype (Gregory Connor and Michael
		O'Neill, bioRxiv 204727 doi:10.1101/204727).
