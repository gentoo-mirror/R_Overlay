		Unbiased Central Moment Estimates // Calculates one-sample
		unbiased central moment estimates and two-sample pooled
		estimates up to 6th order, including estimates of powers and
		products of central moments. Provides the machinery for
		obtaining unbiased central moment estimators beyond 6th order
		by generating expressions for expectations of raw sample
		moments and their powers and products. Gerlovina and Hubbard
