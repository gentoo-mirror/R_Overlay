		Post-Selection Inference for Nonlinear Variable Selection //
		Different post-selection inference strategies for kernel
		selection, as described in "kernelPSI: a Post-Selection
		Inference Framework for Nonlinear Variable Selection", Slim et
		al., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2019,
		http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/slim19a/slim19a.pdf. The
		strategies rest upon quadratic kernel association scores to
		measure the association between a given kernel and an outcome
		of interest. The inference step tests for the joint effect of
		the selected kernels on the outcome. A fast constrained
		sampling algorithm is proposed to derive empirical p-values for
		the test statistics.
