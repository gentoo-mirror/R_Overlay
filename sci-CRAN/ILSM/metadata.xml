		Analyze Interconnection Structure of Multilayer Interaction
		Networks // In view of the analysis of the structural
		characteristics of the multilayer network has been complete,
		however, there is still a lack of a unified operation that can
		quickly obtain the corresponding characteristics of the
		multilayer network. To solve this insufficiency, 'ILSM' was
		designed for supporting calculating such metrics of multilayer
		networks by functions of this R package.
