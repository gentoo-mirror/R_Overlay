		Elastic Net SearcheR // Elastic net regression models are
		controlled by two parameters, lambda, a measure of shrinkage,
		and alpha, a metric defining the model's location on the
		spectrum between ridge and lasso regression. glmnet provides
		tools for selecting lambda via cross validation but no
		automated methods for selection of alpha.  Elastic Net SearcheR
		automates the simultaneous selection of both lambda and alpha.
		Developed, in part, with support by NICHD R03 HD094912.
