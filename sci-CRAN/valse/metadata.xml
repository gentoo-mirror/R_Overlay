		Variable Selection with Mixture of Models // Two methods are
		implemented to cluster data with finite mixture regression
		models. Those procedures deal with high-dimensional covariates
		and responses through a variable selection procedure based on
		the Lasso estimator. A low-rank constraint could be added,
		computed for the Lasso-Rank procedure. A collection of models
		is constructed, varying the level of sparsity and the number of
		clusters, and a model is selected using a model selection
		criterion (slope heuristic, BIC or AIC). Details of the
		procedure are provided in "Model-based clustering for high-
		dimensional data. Application to functional data" by Emilie
		Devijver (2016) arXiv:1409.1333v2, published in Advances in
		Data Analysis and Clustering.
