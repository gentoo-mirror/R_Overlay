		Automated Selection and Visualisation of Statistical Hypothesis
		Tests // Automatically selects and visualises appropriate
		statistical hypothesis tests between a response and a feature
		variable in a data frame. The choice of test depends on the
		class, distribution, and sample size of the input variables, as
		well as the user-defined 'conf.level'. The package focuses on
		visualising the selected test using appropriate plots such as
		box plots, bar charts, regression lines with confidence bands,
		mosaic plots, residual plots and QQ plots. Each plot is
		annotated with relevant test statistics and, where applicable,
		assumption checks and post-hoc results. The scripted workflow
		is particularly well suited for interactive interfaces where
		users access data only through a graphical front end backed by
		server-side R sessions, as well as for quick data exploration,
		for example, in statistical consulting contexts. Implemented
		tests: t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(), oneway.test(),
		kruskal.test(), lm(), fisher.test(), chisq.test(). Tests for
		normality: shapiro.test(), ad.test(). Tests for equal
		variances: bartlett.test(). Post-hoc tests: TukeyHSD(),
		pairwise.wilcox.test().
