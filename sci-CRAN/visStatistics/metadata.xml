		Automated Selection and Visualisation of Statistical Hypothesis
		Tests // Automatically selects and visualises statistical
		hypothesis tests between two vectors, based on their class,
		distribution, sample size, and a user-defined confidence level
		(conf.level). Visual outputs - including box plots, bar charts,
		regression lines with confidence bands, mosaic plots, residual
		plots, and Q-Q plots - are annotated with relevant test
		statistics, assumption checks, and post-hoc analyses where
		applicable. The algorithmic workflow helps the user focus on
		the interpretation of test results rather than test selection.
		It is particularly suited for quick data analysis, e.g., in
		statistical consulting projects or educational settings. The
		test selection algorithm proceeds as follows: Input vectors of
		class numeric or integer are considered numerical; those of
		class factor are considered categorical. Assumptions of
		residual normality and homogeneity of variances are considered
		met if the corresponding test yields a p-value greater than the
		significance level alpha = 1 - conf.level. (1) When the
		response vector is numerical and the predictor vector is
		categorical, a test of central tendencies is selected. If the
		categorical predictor has exactly two levels, t.test() is
		applied when group sizes exceed 30 (Lumley et al. (2002)
		doi:10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546). For smaller
		samples, normality of residuals is tested using shapiro.test();
		if met, t.test() is used; otherwise, wilcox.test(). If the
		predictor is categorical with more than two levels, an aov() is
		initially fitted. Residual normality is evaluated using both
		shapiro.test() and ad.test(); residuals are considered
		approximately normal if at least one test yields a p-value
		above alpha. If this assumption is met, bartlett.test()
		assesses variance homogeneity. If variances are homogeneous,
		aov() is used; otherwise oneway.test(). Both tests are followed
		by TukeyHSD(). If residual normality cannot be assumed,
		kruskal.test() is followed by pairwise.wilcox.test(). (2) When
		both the response and predictor vectors are numerical, a simple
		linear regression model is fitted using lm(). (3) When both
		vectors are categorical, Cochran's rule (Cochran (1954)
		doi:10.2307/3001666) is applied to test independence either by
		chisq.test() or fisher.test().
