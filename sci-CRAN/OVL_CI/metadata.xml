		Inference on the Overlap Coefficient: The Binormal Approach and
		Alternatives // Provides functions to construct confidence
		intervals for the Overlap Coefficient (OVL). OVL measures the
		similarity between two distributions through the overlapping
		area of their distribution functions. Given its intuitive
		description and ease of visual representation by the
		straightforward depiction of the amount of overlap between the
		two corresponding histograms based on samples of measurements
		from each one of the two distributions, the development of
		accurate methods for confidence interval construction can be
		useful for applied researchers. Implements methods based on the
		work of Franco-Pereira, A.M., Nakas, C.T., Reiser, B., and
		Pardo, M.C. (2021) doi:10.1177/09622802211046386.
