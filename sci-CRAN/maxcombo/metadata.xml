		The Group Sequential Max-Combo Test for Comparing Survival Curves
		// Functions for comparing survival curves using the max-combo
		test at a single timepoint or repeatedly at successive
		respective timepoints while controlling type I error (i.e., the
		group sequential setting), as published by Prior (2020)
		doi:10.1177/0962280220931560.  The max-combo test is a
		generalization of the weighted log-rank test, which itself is a
		generalization of the log-rank test, which is a commonly used
		statistical test for comparing survival curves, e.g., during or
		after a clinical trial as part of an effort to determine if a
		new drug or therapy is more effective at delaying undesirable
		outcomes than an established drug or therapy or a placebo.
