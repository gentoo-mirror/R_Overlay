		Robust Tuning and Training for Cross-Source Prediction //
		Provides robust parameter tuning and model training for
		predictive models applied across data sources where the data
		distribution varies slightly from source to source. This
		package implements three primary tuning methods: cross-
		validation-based internal tuning, external tuning, and the
		'RobustTuneC' method. External tuning includes a conservative
		option where parameters are tuned internally on the training
		data and validating on an external dataset, providing a
		slightly pessimistic estimate. It supports Lasso, Ridge, Random
		Forest, Boosting, and Support Vector Machine classifiers.
		Currently, only binary classification is supported. The
		response variable must be the first column of the dataset and a
		factor with exactly two levels. The tuning methods are based on
		the paper by Nicole Ellenbach, Anne-Laure Boulesteix, Bernd
		Bischl, Kristian Unger, and Roman Hornung (2021) "Improved
		Outcome Prediction Across Data Sources Through Robust Parameter
		Tuning" doi:10.1007/s00357-020-09368-z.
