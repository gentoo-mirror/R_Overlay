		Fitting and Forecasting of Grey Model for Multivariate Time
		Series Data // Grey model is commonly used in time series
		forecasting when statistical assumptions are violated with a
		limited number of data points. The minimum number of data
		points required to fit a grey model is four observations. This
		package fits Grey model of First order and One Variable, i.e.,
		GM (1,1) for multivariate time series data and returns the
		parameters of the model, model evaluation criteria and h-step
		ahead forecast values for each of the time series variables.
