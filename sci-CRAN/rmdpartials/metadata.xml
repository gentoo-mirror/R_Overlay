		Partial 'rmarkdown' Documents to Prettify your Reports // Use
		'rmarkdown' partials, also know as child documents in 'knitr',
		so you can make components for HTML, PDF, and Word documents.
		The package provides various helper functions to make certain
		functions easier. You may want to use this package, if you want
		to flexibly summarise objects using a combination of figures,
		tables, text, and HTML widgets. Unlike HTML widgets, the output
		is Markdown and can hence be turn into other output formats
		than HTML.
