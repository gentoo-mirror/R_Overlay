		Efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and WAIC for Bayesian
		Models // Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation
		(LOO) for Bayesian models fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo,
		as described in Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry (2017)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4. The approximation uses Pareto
		smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for
		regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of the
		calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for
		estimated predictive errors and for the comparison of
		predictive errors between models. The package also provides
		methods for using stacking and other model weighting techniques
		to average Bayesian predictive distributions.
