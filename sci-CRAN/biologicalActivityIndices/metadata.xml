		Biological Activity Indices // Ecological alteration of degraded
		lands can improve their sustainability by addition of large
		amount of biomass to soil resulting in improved soil health.
		Soil biological parameters (such as carbon, nitrogen and
		phosphorus cycling enzyme activity) are reactive to minute
		variations in soils [Ghosh et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106176 ]. Hence, biological activity
		index combining Urease, Alkaline Phosphatase, Dehydrogenase
		(DHA)  Beta-Glucosidase activity will assist in detecting early
		changes in restored land use systems [Patidar et al. (2023)
		doi:10.3389/fsufs.2023.1230156]. This package helps to
		calculate Biological Activity Index (BAI) based on vectors of
		Land Use System/treatment and control/reference Land Use System
		containing four values of Urease, Alkaline Phosphatase, DHA
		Beta-Glucosidase. (DHA), urease (URE), fluorescein diacetate
		hydrolysis (FDA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities are
		measured in soil samples using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride,
		urea, fluorescein diacetate and p-nitro phenyl-phosphate as
		substrates, respectively.
