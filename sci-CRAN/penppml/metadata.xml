		Penalized Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood Regression // A set
		of tools that enables efficient estimation of penalized Poisson
		Pseudo Maximum Likelihood regressions, using lasso or ridge
		penalties, for models that feature one or more sets of high-
		dimensional fixed effects. The methodology is based on
		Breinlich, Corradi, Rocha, Ruta, Santos Silva, and Zylkin
		(2021) http://hdl.handle.net/10986/35451 and takes advantage of
		the method of alternating projections of Gaure (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.03.024 for dealing with HDFE, as well
		as the coordinate descent algorithm of Friedman, Hastie and
		Tibshirani (2010) doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01 for fitting lasso
		regressions. The package is also able to carry out cross-
		validation and to implement the plugin lasso of Belloni,
		Chernozhukov, Hansen and Kozbur (2016)
