		Multi Variate Multi Response ADMM with Interaction Effects //
		This system allows one to model a multi-variate, multi-response
		problem with interaction effects. It combines the usual squared
		error loss for the multi-response problem with some penalty
		terms to encourage responses that correlate to form groups and
		also allow for modeling main and interaction effects that exit
		within the covariates. The optimization method employed is the
		Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The
		implementation is based on the methodology presented on Quachie
		Asenso, T.,  Zucknick, M. (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2303.11155.
