		Simulate and Plot Estimates from Cox Proportional Hazards Models
		// Simulates and plots quantities of interest (relative
		hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios) for linear
		coefficients, multiplicative interactions, polynomials,
		penalised splines, and non-proportional hazards, as well as
		stratified survival curves from Cox Proportional Hazard models.
		It also simulates and plots marginal effects for multiplicative
		interactions. Methods described in Gandrud (2015)
