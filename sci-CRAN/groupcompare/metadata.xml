		Comparing Two Groups Using Various Descriptive Statistics //
		Comparing two independent or paired groups across a range of
		descriptive statistics, enabling the evaluation of potential
		differences in central tendency (mean, median), dispersion
		(variance, interquartile range), shape (skewness, kurtosis),
		and distributional characteristics (various quantiles). The
		analytical framework incorporates parametric t-tests, non-
		parametric Wilcoxon tests, permutation tests, and bootstrap
		resampling techniques to assess the statistical significance of
		observed differences.
