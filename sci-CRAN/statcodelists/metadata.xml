		Use Standardized Statistical Codelists // The goal of
		statcodelists is to promote the reuse and exchange of
		statistical information and related metadata with making the
		internationally standardized SDMX code lists available for the
		R user. SDMX has been published as an ISO International
		Standard (ISO 17369). The metadata definitions, including the
		codelists are updated regularly according to the standard. The
		authoritative version of the code lists made available in this
		package is https://sdmx.org/?page_id=3215/.
