		Match One Sample using Two Criteria // Multivariate matching in
		observational studies typically has two goals: 1. to construct
		treated and control groups that have similar distribution of
		observed covariates and 2. to produce matched pairs or sets
		that are homogeneous in a few priority variables. This packages
		implements a network-based method built around a tripartite
		graph that can simultaneously achieve both goals. A detailed
		'RMarkdown' tutorial can be found at
		https://github.com/bzhangupenn/match2C/tree/master/tutorial.
