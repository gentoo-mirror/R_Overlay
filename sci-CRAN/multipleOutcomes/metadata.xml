		Asymptotic Covariance Matrix of Regression Models for Multiple
		Outcomes // Regression models can be fitted for multiple
		outcomes simultaneously. This package computes estimates of
		parameters across fitted models and returns the matrix of
		asymptotic covariance. Various applications of this package,
		including CUPED (Controlled Experiments Utilizing Pre-
		Experiment Data), multiple comparison adjustment, are
		illustrated.
