		An Implementation for the Gravitational Models of Trade // A
		system for creating the bilateral trade flow between a country
		pair equal to zero. You provide the data, tell
		get_zerotradeflow() which variables are of interest and it
		expands the base by creating the bilateral zero trade flow. The
		bases on the flow of trade between countries only report
		positive trade (greater than zero), however, for some analyzes
		of gravitacional models, data on zero flow is also necessary.
		Some examples for Gravity Model: Figueiredo and Loures (2016)
