		Dataframes and Expressions with Statistical Details // Utilities
		for producing dataframes with rich details for the most common
		types of statistical approaches and tests: parametric,
		nonparametric, robust, and Bayesian t-test, one-way ANOVA,
		correlation analyses, contingency table analyses, and meta-
		analyses. The functions are pipe-friendly and provide a
		consistent syntax to work with tidy data. These dataframes
		additionally contain expressions with statistical details, and
		can be used in graphing packages. This package also forms the
		statistical processing backend for 'ggstatsplot'.
