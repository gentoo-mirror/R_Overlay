		Expressions and Dataframes with Statistical Details //
		Statistical processing backend for 'ggstatsplot', this package
		creates expressions with details from statistical tests. It can
		additionally return dataframes with these results, which also
		make these functions a more pipe-friendly way to do statistical
		analysis. Currently, it supports only the most common types of
		statistical tests: parametric, nonparametric, robust, and
		Bayesian versions of t-test/ANOVA, correlation analyses,
		contingency table analysis, and meta-analysis.
