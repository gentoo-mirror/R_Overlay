		Fatigue Crack Growth in Reliability // Fatigue Crack Growth in
		Reliability estimates the distribution of material lifetime due
		to mechanical fatigue efforts. The FCGR package provides
		simultaneous crack growth curves fitting to different specimens
		in materials under mechanical stress efforts. Linear mixed-
		effects models (LME) with smoothing B-Splines and the
		linearized Paris-Erdogan law are applied. Once defined the fail
		for a determined crack length, the distribution function of
		failure times to fatigue is obtained. The density function is
		estimated by applying nonparametric binned kernel density
		estimate (bkde) and the kernel estimator of the distribution
		function (kde). The results of Pinheiro and Bates method based
		on nonlinear mixed-effects regression (nlme) can be also
		retrieved. The package contains the crack.growth, PLOT.cg,
		IB.F, and Alea.A (database) functions.
