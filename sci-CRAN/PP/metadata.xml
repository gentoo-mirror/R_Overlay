		Person Parameter Estimation // The PP package includes estimation
		of (MLE, WLE, MAP, EAP, ROBUST) person parameters for the
		1,2,3,4-PL model and the GPCM (generalized partial credit
		model). The parameters are estimated under the assumption that
		the item parameters are known and fixed. The package is useful
		e.g. in the case that items from an item pool / item bank with
		known item parameters are administered to a new population of
		test-takers and an ability estimation for every test-taker is
		needed.
