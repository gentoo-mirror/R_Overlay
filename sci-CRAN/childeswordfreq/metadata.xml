		Word Frequency Extraction and Summarization // Provides tools to
		extract word frequencies from the CHILDES (Child Language Data
		Exchange System) corpus. The main function allows users to
		input a list of words and receive speaker-role-specific
		frequency counts and a summary of the dataset. The output
		includes Excel-formatted tables of word counts and metadata
		summaries such as number of speakers, transcripts, children,
		and token counts. Useful for researchers studying early
		language acquisition, corpus linguistics, and speaker role
		variation. The CHILDES database is maintained at
		https://childes.talkbank.org/.
