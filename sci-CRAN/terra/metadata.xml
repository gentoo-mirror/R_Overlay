		Spatial Data Analysis // Methods for spatial data analysis with
		vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster (grid) data.
		Methods for vector data include geometric operations such as
		intersect and buffer. Raster methods include local, focal,
		global, zonal and geometric operations. The predict and
		interpolate methods facilitate the use of regression type
		(interpolation, machine learning) models for spatial
		prediction, including with satellite remote sensing data.
		Processing of very large files is supported. See the manual and
		tutorials on https://rspatial.org/ to get started. 'terra'
		replaces the 'raster' package ('terra' can do more, and it is
		faster and easier to use).
