		Spatial Data Analysis // Methods for spatial data analysis with
		raster and vector data. Raster methods allow for low-level data
		manipulation as well as high-level global, local, zonal, and
		focal computation. The predict and interpolate methods
		facilitate the use of regression type (interpolation, machine
		learning) models for spatial prediction, including with
		satellite remote sensing data. Processing of very large files
		is supported. See the manual and tutorials on
		https://rspatial.org/terra/ to get started. 'terra' is very
		similar to the 'raster' package; but 'terra' can do more, is
		simpler to use, and it is faster.
