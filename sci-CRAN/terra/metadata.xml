		Spatial Data Analysis // Methods for spatial data analysis,
		especially raster data. Methods allow for low-level data
		manipulation as well as high-level global, local, zonal, and
		focal computation. The predict and interpolate methods
		facilitate the use of regression type (interpolation, machine
		learning) models for spatial prediction. Processing of very
		large files is supported. See the manual and tutorials on
		https://rspatial.org/terra/ to get started. 'terra' is very
		similar to the 'raster' package; but 'terra' is simpler,
		better, and faster.
