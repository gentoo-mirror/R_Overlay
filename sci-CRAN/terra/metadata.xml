		Classes and Methods for Spatial Data // Classes and methods for
		spatial data, especially raster data. Methods allow for low-
		level data manipulation as well as high-level global, local,
		zonal, and focal computation. The predict and interpolate
		methods facilitate the use of regression type (interpolation,
		machine learning) models for spatial prediction. The user-
		interface is very similar to that of the 'raster' package; but
		it is simpler and faster. Processing of very large files is
		supported. See the manual and tutorials on
		https://rspatial.org/terra/ to get started.
