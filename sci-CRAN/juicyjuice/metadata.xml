		Inline CSS Properties into HTML Tags Using 'juice' // There are
		occasions where you need a piece of HTML with integrated
		styles. A prime example of this is HTML email. This
		transformation involves moving the CSS and associated
		formatting instructions from the style block in the head of
		your document into the body of the HTML. Many prominent email
		clients require integrated styles in HTML email; otherwise a
		received HTML email will be displayed without any styling. This
		package will quickly and precisely perform these CSS
		transformations when given HTML text and it does so by using
		the JavaScript 'juice' library.
