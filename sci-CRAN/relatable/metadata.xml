		Functions for Mapping Key-Value Pairs, Many-to-Many, One-to-Many,
		and Many-to-One Relations // Functions to safely map from a
		vector of keys to a vector of values, determine properties of a
		given relation, or ensure a relation conforms to a given type,
		such as many-to-many, one-to-many, injective, surjective, or
		bijective. Permits default return values for use similar to a
		vectorised switch statement, as well as safely handling large
		vectors, NAs, and duplicate mappings.
