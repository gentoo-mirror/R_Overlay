		Tools for Defensive Programming // Tools for defensive
		programming, inspired by 'purrr' mappers and based on
		'rlang'.'attempt' extends and facilitates defensive programming
		by providing a consistent grammar, and provides a set of easy
		to use functions for common tests and conditions. 'attempt'
		only depends on 'rlang', and focuses on speed, so it can be
		easily integrated in other functions and used in data analysis.
