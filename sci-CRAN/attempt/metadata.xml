		Easy Condition Handling // A friendlier condition handler,
		inspired by 'purrr' mappers and based on 'rlang'. 'attempt'
		extends and facilitates condition handling by providing a
		consistent grammar, and provides a set of easy to use functions
		for common tests and conditions. 'attempt' only depends on
		'rlang', and focuses on speed, so it can be easily integrated
		in other functions and used in data analysis.
