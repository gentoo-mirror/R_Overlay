		Nonnegative Garrote Method Incorporating Hierarchical
		Relationships // An implementation of the nonnegative garrote
		method that incorporates hierarchical relationships among
		variables. The core function, HiGarrote(), offers an automated
		approach for analyzing experiments while respecting
		hierarchical structures among effects. For methodological
		details, refer to Yu and Joseph (2024)
