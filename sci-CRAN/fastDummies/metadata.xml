		Fast Creation of Dummy (Binary) Columns and Rows from Categorical
		Variables // Creates dummy columns from columns that have
		categorical variables (character or factor types). You can also
		specify which columns to make dummies out of, or which columns
		to ignore. Also creates dummy rows from character, factor, and
		Date columns. This package provides a significant speed
		increase from creating dummy variables through model.matrix().
