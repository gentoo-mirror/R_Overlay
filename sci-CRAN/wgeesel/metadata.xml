		Weighted Generalized Estimating Equations and Model Selection //
		Weighted generalized estimating equations (WGEE) is an
		extension of generalized linear models to longitudinal
		clustered data by incorporating the correlation within-cluster
		when data is missing at random (MAR). The parameters in mean,
		scale correlation structures are estimated based on quasi-
		likelihood. Multiple model selection criterion are provided for
		selection of mean model and working correlation structure based
		on WGEE/GEE.
