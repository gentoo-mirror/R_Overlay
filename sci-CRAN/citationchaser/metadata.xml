		Perform Forward and Backwards Chasing in Evidence Syntheses // In
		searching for research articles, we often want to obtain lists
		of references from across studies, and also obtain lists of
		articles that cite a particular study. In systematic reviews,
		this supplementary search technique is known as 'citation
		chasing': forward citation chasing looks for all records citing
		one or more articles of known relevance; backward citation
		chasing looks for all records referenced in one or more
		articles. Traditionally, this process would be done manually,
		and the resulting records would need to be checked one-by-one
		against included studies in a review to identify potentially
		relevant records that should be included in a review. This
		package contains functions to automate this process by making
		use of the Lens.org API. An input article list can be used to
		return a list of all referenced records, and/or all citing
		records in the Lens.org database (consisting of PubMed, PubMed
		Central, CrossRef, Microsoft Academic Graph and CORE;
		https://www.lens.org).
