		Some Functions to be Used as Shortcuts in 'RStudio' // 'RStudio'
		as of recently offers the option to define addins and assign
		shortcuts to them. This package contains addins for a few most
		frequently used functions in a data scientist's (at least mine)
		daily work (like str(), example(), plot(), head(), view(),
		Desc()). Most of these functions will use the current selection
		in the editor window and send the specific command to the
		console while instantly executing it. Assigning shortcuts to
		these addins will save you quite a few keystrokes.
