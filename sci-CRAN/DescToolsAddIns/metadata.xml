		Some Functions to be Used as Shortcuts in 'RStudio' // 'RStudio'
		as of recently offers the option to define addins and assign
		shortcuts to them. This package contains AddIns for a few most
		used functions in an analysts (at least mine) daily work (like
		str(), example(), plot(), head(), view(), Desc()). Most of
		these functions will get the current selection in the editor
		window and send the specific command to the console while
		instantly executing it. Assigning shortcuts to these AddIns
		will spare you quite a few keystrokes.
