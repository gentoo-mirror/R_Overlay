		Fitting Differential Equations to Time Series Data // Use
		numerical optimization to fit ordinary differential equations
		(ODEs) to time series data to examine the dynamic relationships
		between variables or the characteristics of a dynamical system.
		It can now be used to estimate the parameters of ODEs up to
		second order, and can also apply to multilevel systems. See
		https://github.com/yueqinhu/defit for details.
