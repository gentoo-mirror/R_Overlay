		Spatial Price Level Comparisons // Price comparisons within or
		between countries provide an overall measure of the relative
		difference in prices, often denoted as price levels. This
		package provides index number methods for such price
		comparisons (e.g., The World Bank, 2011,
		doi:10.1596/978-0-8213-9728-2). Moreover, it contains functions
		for sampling and characterizing price data.
