		The Full Bayesian Evidence Test, Full Bayesian Significance Test
		and the e-Value // Provides access to a range of functions for
		computing and visualizing the Full Bayesian Significance Test
		(FBST) and the e-value for testing a sharp hypothesis against
		its alternative, and the Full Bayesian Evidence Test (FBET) and
		the (generalized) Bayesian evidence value for testing a
		composite (or interval) hypothesis against its alternative. The
		methods are widely applicable as long as a posterior MCMC
		sample is available.
