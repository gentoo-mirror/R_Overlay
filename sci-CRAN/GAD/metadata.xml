		Analysis of Variance from General Principles // Analysis of
		complex ANOVA models with any combination of orthogonal/nested
		and fixed/random factors, as described by Underwood (1997).
		There are two restrictions: (i) data must be balanced; (ii)
		fixed nested factors are not allowed. Homogeneity of variances
		is checked using Cochran's C test and 'a posteriori'
		comparisons of means are done using Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK)
		procedure. For those terms with no denominator in the F-ratio
		calculation, pooled mean squares and quasi F-ratios are
		provided. Magnitute of effects are assessed by components of
		variation.
