		Fitting Point Process Models via the Palm Likelihood // Functions
		to fit point process models using the Palm likelihood. First
		proposed by Tanaka, Ogata, and Stoyan (2008)
		DOI:10.1002/bimj.200610339, maximisation of the Palm likelihood
		can provide computationally efficient parameter estimation for
		point process models in situations where the full likelihood is
		intractable. This package is chiefly focused on Neyman-Scott
		point processes, but can also fit the void processes proposed
		by Jones-Todd et al. (2019) DOI:10.1002/sim.8046. The
		development of this package was motivated by the analysis of
		capture-recapture surveys on which individuals cannot be
		identified---the data from which can conceptually be seen as a
		clustered point process (Stevenson, Borchers, and Fewster, 2019
		DOI:10.1111/biom.12983). As such, some of the functions in this
		package are specifically for the estimation of cetacean density
		from two-camera aerial surveys.
