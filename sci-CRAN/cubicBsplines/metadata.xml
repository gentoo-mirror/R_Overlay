		Computation of a Cubic B-Spline Basis and Its Derivatives //
		Computation of a cubic B-spline basis for arbitrary knots. It
		also provides the 1st and 2nd derivatives, as well as the
		integral of the basis elements. It is used by the author to fit
		penalized B-spline models, see e.g. Jullion, A. and Lambert, P.
		(2006) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2006.09.027,  Lambert, P. and
		Eilers, P.H.C. (2009) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.11.022 and, more
		recently, Lambert, P. (2021) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2021.107250. It
		is inspired by the algorithm developed by de Boor, C. (1977)
