		Randomization-Based Covariance Adjustment of Win Statistics // A
		multi-visit clinical trial may collect participant responses on
		an ordinal scale and may utilize a stratified design, such as
		randomization within centers, to assess treatment efficacy
		across multiple visits. Baseline characteristics may be
		strongly associated with the outcome, and adjustment for them
		can improve power. The win ratio (ignores ties) and the win
		odds (accounts for ties) can be useful when analyzing these
		types of data from randomized controlled trials. This package
		provides straightforward functions for adjustment of the win
		ratio and win odds for stratification and baseline covariates,
		facilitating the comparison of test and control treatments in
		multi-visit clinical trials. For additional information
		concerning the methodologies and applied examples within this
		package, please refer to the following publications: 1.
