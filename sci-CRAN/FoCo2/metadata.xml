		Coherent Forecast Combination for Linearly Constrained Multiple
		Time Series // Methods and tools designed to improve the
		forecast accuracy for a linearly constrained multiple time
		series, while fulfilling the linear/aggregation relationships
		linking the components (Girolimetto and Di Fonzo, 2024
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.03429). 'FoCo2' offers multi-task
		forecast combination and reconciliation approaches leveraging
		input from multiple forecasting models or experts and ensuring
		that the resulting forecasts satisfy specified linear
		constraints. In addition, linear inequality constraints (e.g.,
		non-negativity of the forecasts) can be imposed, if needed.
