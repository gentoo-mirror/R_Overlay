		Flexible Mixture Modeling // A general framework for finite
		mixtures of regression models using the EM algorithm is
		implemented. The E-step and all data handling are provided,
		while the M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define
		new models. Existing drivers implement mixtures of standard
		linear models, generalized linear models and model-based
		clustering.
