		Sparse Estimation of Cox Proportional Hazards Models via
		Approximated Information Criterion // Sparse estimation for Cox
		PH models is done via Minimum approximated Information
		Criterion (MIC) by Su, Wijayasinghe, Fan, and Zhang (2016)
		DOI:10.1111/biom.12484. MIC mimics the best subset selection
		using a penalized likelihood approach yet with no need of a
		tuning parameter. The problem is further reformulated with a
		re-parameterization step so that it reduces to one
		unconstrained non-convex yet smooth programming problem, which
		can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, the re-parameterization
		tactic yields an additional advantage in terms of circumventing
		post-selection inference.
