		Simple Metrics to Summarize Growth Curves // Fits the logistic
		equation to microbial growth curve data (e.g., repeated
		absorbance measurements taken from a plate reader over time).
		From this fit, a variety of metrics are provided, including the
		maximum growth rate, the doubling time, the carrying capacity,
		the area under the logistic curve, and the time to the
		inflection point. Method described in Sprouffske and Wagner
		(2016) doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1016-7.
