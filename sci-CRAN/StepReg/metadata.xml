		Stepwise Regression Analysis // Stepwise regression is a
		statistical technique used for model selection. This package
		streamlines stepwise regression analysis by supporting multiple
		regression types(linear, Cox, logistic, Poisson, Gamma, and
		negative binomial), incorporating popular selection
		strategies(forward, backward, bidirectional, and subset), and
		offering essential metrics. It enables users to apply multiple
		selection strategies and metrics in a single function call,
		visualize variable selection processes, and export results in
		various formats. StepReg offers a data-splitting option to
		address potential issues with invalid statistical inference and
		a randomized forward selection option to avoid overfitting. We
		validated StepReg's accuracy using public datasets within the
		SAS software environment. For an interactive web interface,
		users can install the companion 'StepRegShiny' package.
