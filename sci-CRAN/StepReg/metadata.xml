		Stepwise Regression Analysis // The stepwise regression analysis
		is a statistical technique used to identify a subset of
		predictor variables essential for constructing predictive
		models. This package performs stepwise regression analysis
		across various regression models such as linear, logistic, Cox
		proportional hazards, Poisson, and gamma regression. It
		incorporates diverse stepwise regression algorithms like
		forward selection, backward elimination, and bidirectional
		elimination alongside the best subset method. Additionally, it
		offers a wide range of selection criteria, including Akaike
		Information Criterion (AIC), corrected AIC (AICc), Sawa
		Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Schwarz Bayesian
		Information Criterion (SBC), Significant Levels (SL), among
		others. Moreover, it facilitates the concurrent selection of
		multiple methods and criteria for variable selection. For user-
		friendly exploration and analysis, StepReg provides an
		intuitive R Shiny app.
