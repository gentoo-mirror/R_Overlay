		Stepwise Regression Analysis // The stepwise regression analysis
		is a statistical technique used to identify a subset of
		predictor variables essential for constructing predictive
		models. This package performs stepwise regression analysis
		across various regression models such as linear, logistic, Cox
		proportional hazards, Poisson, Gamma, and negative binomial
		regression. It incorporates diverse stepwise regression
		algorithms like forward selection, backward elimination, and
		bidirectional elimination alongside the best subset method.
		Additionally, it offers a wide range of selection criteria,
		including Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Sawa Bayesian
		Information Criterion (BIC), and Significance Levels (SL). We
		validated the output accuracy of StepReg using public datasets
		within the SAS software environment. To facilitate efficient
		model comparison and selection, StepReg allows for multiple
		strategies and selection metrics to be executed in a single
		function call. Moreover, StepReg integrates a Shiny application
		for interactive regression analysis, broadening its
		accessibility.
