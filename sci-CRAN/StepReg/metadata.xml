		Stepwise Regression Analysis // Stepwise regression is a
		statistical technique used for model selection. This package
		streamlines stepwise regression analysis by supporting multiple
		regression types, incorporating popular selection strategies,
		and offering essential metrics. It enables users to apply
		multiple selection strategies and metrics in a single function
		call, visualize variable selection processes, and export
		results in various formats. However, StepReg should not be used
		for statistical inference unless the variable selection process
		is explicitly accounted for, as it can compromise the validity
		of the results. This limitation does not apply when StepReg is
		used for prediction purposes. We validated StepReg's accuracy
		using public datasets within the SAS software environment.
		Additionally, StepReg features an interactive Shiny application
		to enhance usability and accessibility.
