		Stepwise Regression Analysis // Stepwise regression analysis for
		variable selection can be used to get the best candidate final
		regression model in univariate or multivariate regression
		analysis with the 'forward', 'backward' and 'bidirection'
		steps. Besides, best subset selection is included in this
		package. Procedure can use Akaike information criterion,
		corrected Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information
		criterion, Hannan and Quinn information criterion, corrected
		Hannan and Quinn information criterion, Schwarz criterion and
		significance levels as selection criteria. Multicollinearity
		detection in regression model are performed by checking
		tolerance value. Continuous variables nested within class
		effect and weighted stepwise regression are also considered.
