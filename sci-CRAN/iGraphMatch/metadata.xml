		Tools Graph Matching // Graph matching methods and analysis. The
		package works for both 'igraph' objects and matrix objects. You
		provide the adjacency matrices of two graphs and some other
		information you might know, choose the graph matching method,
		and it returns the graph matching results. 'iGraphMatch' also
		provides a bunch of useful functions you might need related to
		graph matching.
