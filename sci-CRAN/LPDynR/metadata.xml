		Land Productivity Dynamics Indicator // It uses 'phenological'
		and productivity-related variables derived from time series of
		vegetation indexes, such as the Normalized Difference
		Vegetation Index, to assess ecosystem dynamics and change,
		which eventually might drive to land degradation. The final
		result of the Land Productivity Dynamics indicator is a
		categorical map with 5 classes of land productivity dynamics,
		ranging from declining to increasing productivity. See
		www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X21010517/
		for a description of the methods used in the package to
		calculate the indicator.
