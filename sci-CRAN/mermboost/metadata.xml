		Gradient Boosting for Generalized Additive Mixed Models //
		Provides a novel framework to estimate mixed models via
		gradient boosting. The implemented functions are based on the
		'mboost' and 'lme4' packages, and the family range is therefore
		determined by 'lme4'. A correction mechanism for cluster-
		constant covariates is implemented, as well as estimation of
		the covariance of random effects. These methods are described
		in the accompanying publication; see
		doi:10.1007/s11222-025-10612-y for details.
