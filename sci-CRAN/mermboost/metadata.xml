		Gradient Boosting for Generalized Additive Mixed Models //
		Provides a novel framework to estimate mixed models via
		gradient boosting. The implemented functions are based on
		'mboost' and 'lme4'. Hence, the family range is predetermined
		by 'lme4'. A correction mechanism for cluster-constant
		covariates is implemented as well as an estimation of random
		effects' covariance.
