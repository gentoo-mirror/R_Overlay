		Lottery Datasets from Caixa Economica Federal // A collection of
		functions designed to streamline the retrieval of data from
		Brazilian lottery games operated by Caixa Econmica Federal,
		accessible through the official website at
		https://loterias.caixa.gov.br/Paginas/default.aspx/. Datasets
		for each game are conveniently stored on the GitHub page at
		https://github.com/tomasbp2/LotteryBrasilDATA/. Each game
		within this repository consists of two primary datasets: the
		winners dataset and the numbers dataset. The winners dataset
		includes crucial information such as the draw date, game type,
		potential matches, winners for each match, and corresponding
		prize amounts. Meanwhile, the numbers dataset provides
		essential details including the draw date, game type, and the
		numbers drawn during the respective lottery event. By offering
		easy access to these datasets, the package facilitates
		efficient data retrieval and analysis for researchers,
		analysts, and enthusiasts interested in exploring the dynamics
		and outcomes of Brazilian lottery games.
