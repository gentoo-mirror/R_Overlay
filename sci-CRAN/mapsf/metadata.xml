		your workflow. This package helps to design various
		cartographic representations such as proportional symbols,
		choropleth or typology maps. It also offers several functions
		to display layout elements that improve the graphic
		presentation of maps (e.g. scale bar, north arrow, title,
		labels). 'mapsf' maps 'sf' objects on 'base' graphics.
