		ACE File to FASTQ Converter // The ACE file format is used in
		genomics to store contigs from sequencing machines. This tools
		converts it into FASTQ format. Both formats contain the
		sequence characters and their corresponding quality
		information. Unlike the FASTQ file, the ace file stores the
		quality values numerically. The conversion algorithm uses the
		standard Sanger formula. The package facilitates insertion into
		pipelines, and content inspection.
