		ACE File to FASTQ Converter // The ACE file format is currently
		used in genomics to store contigs from ABI sequencing machines.
		To the best of our knowledge, no R function is available to
		convert this format into the more popular fastq file format.
		The development was motivated in the context of the analysis of
		16S metagenomic data by the need to convert the ACE files
		received from a sequencing service for further analysis.
