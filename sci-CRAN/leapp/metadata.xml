		Latent Effect Adjustment After Primary Projection // These
		functions take a gene expression value matrix, a primary
		covariate vector, an additional known covariates matrix.  A two
		stage analysis is applied to counter the effects of latent
		variables on the rankings of hypotheses.  The estimation and
		adjustment of latent effects are proposed by Sun, Zhang and
		Owen (2011).  "leapp" is developed in the context of microarray
		experiments, but may be used as a general tool for high
		throughput data sets where dependence may be involved.
