		Chemical Metrics of Community Reference Proteomes // Combines
		taxonomic classifications of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene
		sequences with reference proteomes of archaeal and bacterial
		taxa to generate amino acid compositions of community reference
		proteomes. Calculates chemical metrics including carbon
		oxidation state ('Zc'), stoichiometric oxidation and hydration
		state ('nO2' and 'nH2O'), H/C, N/C, O/C, and S/C ratios, grand
		average of hydropathicity ('GRAVY'), isoelectric point ('pI'),
		protein length, and average molecular weight of amino acid
		residues. Uses precomputed reference proteomes for archaea and
		bacteria derived from the Genome Taxonomy Database ('GTDB').
		Also includes reference proteomes derived from the NCBI
		Reference Sequence ('RefSeq') database and manual mapping from
		the 'RDP Classifier' training set to 'RefSeq' taxonomy as
		described by Dick and Tan (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s00248-022-01988-9. Processes taxonomic
		classifications in 'RDP Classifier' format or OTU tables in
		'phyloseq-class' objects from the Bioconductor package
		'phyloseq'.
