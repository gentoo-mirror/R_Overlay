		Extract and Analyze Rivers from Elevation Data // Seamless
		extraction of river networks from digital elevation models
		data. The package allows analysis of digital elevation models
		that can be either externally provided or downloaded from open
		source repositories (thus interfacing with the 'elevatr'
		package). Extraction is performed via the 'D8' flow direction
		algorithm of TauDEM (Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation
		Models), thus interfacing with the 'traudem' package. Resulting
		river networks are compatible with functions from the 'OCNet'
		package. See Carraro (2023) doi:10.5194/hess-27-3733-2023 for a
		presentation of the package.
