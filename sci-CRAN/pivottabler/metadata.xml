		Create Pivot Tables in R // Create regular pivot tables with just
		a few lines of R. More complex pivot tables can also be
		created, e.g. pivot tables with irregular layouts, multiple
		calculations and/or derived calculations based on multiple data
		frames.  Pivot tables are constructed using R only and can be
		written to a range of output formats (plain text, 'HTML',
		'Latex' and 'Excel'), including with styling/formatting.
