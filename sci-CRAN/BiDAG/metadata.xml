		Bayesian Inference for Directed Acyclic Graphs (BiDAG): Software
		for the Efficient Inference and Sampling of Bayesian Networks
		// Implementation of a collection of MCMC methods for Bayesian
		structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), both from
		continuous and discrete data. For efficient inference on larger
		DAGs, the space of DAGs is pruned according to the data. To
		filter the search space, the algorithm employs a hybrid
		approach, combining constraint-based learning with search and
		score. A reduced search space is initially defined on the basis
		of a skeleton obtained by means of the PC-algorithm, and then
		iteratively improved with search and score. Search and score is
		then performed following two approaches: Order MCMC, or
		Partition MCMC. The BGe score is implemented for continuous
		data and the BDe score is implemented for binary data. The
		algorithms may provide the maximum a posteriori (MAP) graph or
		a sample (a collection of DAGs) from the posterior distribution
		given the data.
