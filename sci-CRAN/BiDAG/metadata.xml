		Bayesian Inference for Directed Acyclic Graphs // Implementation
		of a collection of MCMC methods for Bayesian structure learning
		of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), both from continuous and
		discrete data. For efficient inference on larger DAGs, the
		space of DAGs is pruned according to the data. To filter the
		search space, the algorithm employs a hybrid approach,
		combining constraint-based learning with search and score. A
		reduced search space is initially defined on the basis of a
		skeleton obtained by means of the PC-algorithm, and then
		iteratively improved with search and score. Search and score is
		then performed following two approaches: Order MCMC, or
		Partition MCMC. The BGe score is implemented for continuous
		data and the BDe score is implemented for binary data or
		categorical data. The algorithms may provide the maximum a
		posteriori (MAP) graph or a sample (a collection of DAGs) from
		the posterior distribution given the data. All algorithms are
		also applicable for structure learning and sampling for dynamic
		Bayesian networks. References: J. Kuipers, P. Suter, G. Moffa
