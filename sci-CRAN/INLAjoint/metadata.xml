		Multivariate Joint Modeling for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event
		Outcomes with 'INLA' // Estimation of joint models for
		multivariate longitudinal markers (with various distributions
		available) and survival outcomes (possibly accounting for
		competing risks) with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations
		(INLA). The flexible and user friendly function joint()
		facilitates the use of the fast and reliable inference
		technique implemented in the 'INLA' package for joint modeling.
		More details are given in the help page of the joint() function
		(accessible via ?joint in the R console) and the vignette
		associated to the joint() function (accessible via
		vignette("INLAjoint") in the R console).
