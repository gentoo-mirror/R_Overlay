		Genetic Association Models for X-Chromosome SNPS on Continuous,
		Binary and Survival Outcomes // The expression of X-chromosome
		undergoes three possible biological processes: X-chromosome
		inactivation (XCI), escape of the X-chromosome inactivation
		(XCI-E),and skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-S). To
		analyze the X-linked genetic association for phenotype such as
		continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes with the actual
		process unknown, we propose a unified approach of maximizing
		the likelihood or partial likelihood over all of the potential
		biological processes. The methods are described in Wei Xu,
		Meiling Hao (2017) doi:10.1002/gepi.22097.
