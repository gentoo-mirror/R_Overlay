		Estimating Absolute Protein Quantities from Label-Free LC-MS/MS
		Proteomics Data // Determination of absolute protein quantities
		is necessary for multiple applications, such as mechanistic
		modeling of biological systems. Quantitative liquid
		chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics
		can measure relative protein abundance on a system-wide scale.
		To estimate absolute quantitative information using these
		relative abundance measurements requires additional information
		such as heavy-labeled references of known concentration.
		Multiple methods have been using different references and
		strategies; some are easily available whereas others require
		more effort on the users end. Hence, we believe the field might
		benefit from making some of these methods available under an
		automated framework, which also facilitates validation of the
		chosen strategy. We have implemented the most commonly used
		absolute label-free protein abundance estimation methods for
		LC-MS/MS modes quantifying on either MS1-, MS2-levels or
		spectral counts together with validation algorithms to enable
		automated data analysis and error estimation. Specifically, we
		used Monte-carlo cross-validation and bootstrapping for model
		selection and imputation of proteome-wide absolute protein
		quantity estimation. Our open-source software is written in the
		statistical programming language R and validated and
		demonstrated on a synthetic sample.
