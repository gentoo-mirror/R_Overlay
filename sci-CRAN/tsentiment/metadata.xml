		Fetching Tweet Data for Sentiment Analysis // Which uses Twitter
		APIs for the necessary data in sentiment analysis, acts as a
		middleware with the approved Twitter Application. A special
		access key is given to users who subscribe to the application
		with their Twitter account. With this special access key, the
		user defined keyword for sentiment analysis can be searched in
		twitter recent searches and results can be obtained( more
		information https://github.com/hakkisabah/tsentiment ). In
		addition, a service named tsentiment-services has been
		developed to provide all these operations ( for more
		information https://github.com/hakkisabah/tsentiment-services
		). After the successful results obtained and in line with the
		permissions given by the user, the results of the analysis of
		the word cloud and bar graph saved in the user folder directory
		can be seen. In each analysis performed, the previous analysis
		visual result is deleted and this is the basic information you
		need to know as a practice rule. 'tsentiment' package provides
		a free service that acts as a middleware for easy data
		extraction from Twitter, and in return, the user rate limit is
		reduced by 30 requests from the total limit and the remaining
		requests are used. These 30 requests are reserved for use in
		application analytics. For information about endpoints, you can
		refer to the limit information in the "GET search/tweets" row
		in the Endpoints column in the list at
		https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/rate-
		limits.
