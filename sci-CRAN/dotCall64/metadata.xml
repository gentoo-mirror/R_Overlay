		Enhanced Foreign Function Interface Supporting Long Vectors //
		Provides .C64(), which is an enhanced version of .C() and
		.Fortran() from the foreign function interface. .C64() supports
		long vectors, arguments of type 64-bit integer, and provides a
		mechanism to avoid unnecessary copies of read-only and write-
		only arguments. This makes it a convenient and fast interface
		to C/C++ and Fortran code.
