		Label Data Frames, Variables, and Values // Create and use data
		frame labels for data frame objects (frame labels), their
		columns (name labels), and individual values of a column (value
		labels). Value labels include one-to-one and many-to-one labels
		for nominal and ordinal variables, as well as numerical range-
		based value labels for continuous variables. Convert value-
		labeled variables so each value is replaced by its
		corresponding value label. Add values-converted-to-labels
		columns to a value-labeled data frame while preserving parent
		columns. Filter and subset a value-labeled data frame using
		labels, while returning results in terms of values. Overlay
		labels in place of values in common R commands to increase
		interpretability. Generate tables of value frequencies, with
		categories expressed as raw values or as labels. Access data
		frames that show value-to-label mappings for easy reference.
