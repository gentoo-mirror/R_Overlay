		Interactive Visualization of Bayesian Networks // Bayesian
		networks provide an intuitive framework for probabilistic
		reasoning and its graphical nature can be interpreted quite
		clearly. Graph based methods of machine learning are becoming
		more popular because they offer a richer model of knowledge
		that can be understood by a human in a graphical format. The
		'bnviewer' is an R Package that allows the interactive
		visualization of Bayesian Networks. The aim of this package is
		to improve the Bayesian Networks visualization over the basic
		and static views offered by existing packages.
