		Run Reports, Models, and Scripts from a Mobile Device // A
		framework for interacting with R modules such as Reports,
		Models, and Scripts from a mobile device. The framework allows
		you to list available modules and select a module of interest
		using a basic e-mail interface. After selecting a specific
		module, you can either run it as is or provide input via the
		e-mail interface. After parsing your request, R will send the
		results back to your mobile device.
