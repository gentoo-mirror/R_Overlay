		Joint Clustering and Alignment of Functional Data // Revisited
		clustering approaches to accommodate functional data by
		allowing to jointly align the data during the clustering
		process. Currently, shift, dilation and affine transformations
		only are available to perform alignment. The k-mean algorithm
		has been extended to integrate alignment and is fully
		parallelized. Hierarchical clustering will soon be available as
		well. References: Sangalli L.M., Secchi P., Vantini S., Vitelli
