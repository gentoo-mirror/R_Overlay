		Jack, Zonal, and Schur Polynomials // Symbolic calculation and
		evaluation of the Jack polynomials, zonal polynomials, and
		Schur polynomials. Mainly based on Demmel  Koev's paper (2006)
		doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1. Zonal polynomials and Schur
		polynomials are particular cases of Jack polynomials. Zonal
		polynomials appear in random matrix theory. Schur polynomials
		appear in the field of combinatorics.
