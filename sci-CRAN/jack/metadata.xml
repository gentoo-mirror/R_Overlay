		Jack, Zonal, Schur, and Other Symmetric Polynomials // Schur
		polynomials appear in combinatorics and zonal polynomials
		appear in random matrix theory. They are particular cases of
		Jack polynomials. This package allows to compute these
		polynomials and other symmetric multivariate polynomials:
		flagged Schur polynomials, factorial Schur polynomials, t-Schur
		polynomials, Hall-Littlewood polynomials, Macdonald
		polynomials, and modified Macdonald polynomials. In addition,
		it can compute the Kostka-Jack numbers, the Kostka-Foulkes
		polynomials, the Kostka-Macdonald polynomials, and the Hall
		polynomials.  Mainly based on Demmel  Koev's paper (2006)
		doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1 and Macdonald's book (1995)
		doi:10.1093/oso/9780198534891.003.0001.
