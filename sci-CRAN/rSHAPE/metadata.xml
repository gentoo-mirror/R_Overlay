		Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution // In silico
		experimental evolution offers a cost-and-time effective means
		to test evolutionary hypotheses.  Existing evolutionary
		simulation tools focus on simulations in a limited experimental
		framework, and tend to report on only the results presumed of
		interest by the tools designer.  The R-package for Simulated
		Haploid Asexual Population Evolution ('rSHAPE') addresses these
		concerns by implementing a robust simulation framework that
		outputs complete population demographic and genomic information
		for in silico evolving communities.  Allowing more than 60
		parameters to be specified, 'rSHAPE'        simulates evolution
		across discrete time-steps for an evolving community of haploid
		asexual populations with binary state genomes.  These settings
		are for the current state of 'rSHAPE' and future steps will be
		to increase the breadth of evolutionary conditions permitted.
		At present, most effort was placed into permitting varied
		growth models to be simulated (such as constant size,
		exponential growth, and logistic growth) as well as various
		fitness landscape models to reflect the evolutionary landscape
		(e.g.: Additive, House of Cards - Stuart Kauffman and Simon
		Levin (1987) doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(87)80029-2, NK - Stuart A.
		Kauffman and Edward D. Weinberger (1989)
		doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80019-0, Rough Mount Fuji - Neidhart,
		Johannes and Szendro, Ivan G and Krug, Joachim (2014)
		doi:10.1534/genetics.114.167668). This package includes
		numerous functions though users will only need defineSHAPE(),
		runSHAPE(), shapeExperiment() and summariseExperiment().  All
		other functions are called by these main functions and are
		likely only to be on interest for someone wishing to develop
		'rSHAPE'.  Simulation results will be stored in files which are
		exported to the directory referenced by the shape_workDir
		option (defaults to tempdir() but do change this by passing a
		folderpath argument for workDir when calling defineSHAPE() if
		you plan to make use of your results beyond your current
		session).  'rSHAPE' will generate numerous replicate
		simulations for your defined range of experimental parameters.
		The experiment will be built under the experimental working
		directory (i.e.: referenced by the option shape_workDir set
		using defineSHAPE() ) where individual replicate simulation
		results will be stored as well as processed results which I
		have made in an effort to facilitate analyses by automating
		collection and processing of the potentially thousands of files
		which will be created. On that note, 'rSHAPE' implements a
		robust and flexible framework with highly detailed output at
		the cost of computational efficiency and potentially requiring
		significant disk space (generally gigabytes but up to tera-
		bytes for very large simulation efforts).  So, while 'rSHAPE'
		offers a single framework in which we can simulate evolution
		and directly compare the impacts of a wide range of parameters,
		it is not as quick to run as other in silico simulation tools
		which focus on a single scenario with limited output. There you
		have it, 'rSHAPE' offers you a less restrictive in silico
		evolutionary playground than other tools and I hope you enjoy
		testing your hypotheses.
