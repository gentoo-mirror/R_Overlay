		Random Projection Ensemble Classification // Implements the
		methodology of "Cannings, T. I. and Samworth, R. J. (2017)
		Random-projection ensemble classification, J. Roy. Stat. Soc.,
		Ser. B. (with discussion), 79, 959--1035". The random
		projection ensemble classifier is a general method for
		classification of high-dimensional data, based on careful
		combination of the results of applying an arbitrary base
		classifier to random projections of the feature vectors into a
		lower-dimensional space. The random projections are divided
		into non-overlapping blocks, and within each block the
		projection yielding the smallest estimate of the test error is
		selected. The random projection ensemble classifier then
		aggregates the results of applying the base classifier on the
		selected projections, with a data-driven voting threshold to
		determine the final assignment.
