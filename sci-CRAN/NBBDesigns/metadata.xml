		Neighbour Balanced Block Designs (NBBDesigns) // Neighbour-
		balanced designs ensure that no treatment is disadvantaged
		unfairly by its surroundings. The treatment allocation in these
		designs is such that every treatment appears equally often as a
		neighbour with every other treatment. Neighbour Balanced
		Designs are employed when there is a possibility of neighbour
		effects from treatments used in adjacent experimental units. In
		the literature, a vast number of such designs have been
		developed. This package generates some efficient neighbour
		balanced block designs which are balanced and partially
		variance balanced for estimating the contrast pertaining to
		direct and neighbour effects, as well as provides a function
		for analysing the data obtained from such trials (Azais, J.M.,
		Bailey, R.A. and Monod, H. (1993). "A catalogue of efficient
		neighbour designs with border plots". Biometrics, 49, 1252-1261
		; Tomar, J. S., Jaggi, Seema and Varghese, Cini (2005)DOI:
		10.1080/0266476042000305177. "On totally balanced block designs
		for competition effects"). This package contains functions
		named nbbd1(),nbbd2(),nbbd3(),pnbbd1() and pnbbd2() which
		generates neighbour balanced block designs within a specified
		range of number of treatment (v). It contains another function
		named anlys()for performing the analysis of data generated from
		such trials.
