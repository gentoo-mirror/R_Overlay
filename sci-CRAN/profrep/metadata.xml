		Profile Repeatability // Calculates profile repeatability for
		replicate stress response curves, or similar time-series data.
		Profile repeatability is an individual repeatability metric
		that uses the variances at each timepoint, the maximum
		variance, the number of crossings (lines that cross over each
		other), and the number of replicates to compute the
		repeatability score. For more information see Reed et al.
