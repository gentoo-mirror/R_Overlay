		Robust Principal Component Analysis Using the Cauchy Distribution
		// A new robust principal component analysis algorithm is
		implemented that relies upon the Cauchy Distribution. The
		algorithm is suitable for high dimensional data even if the
		sample size is less than the number of variables. The
		methodology is described in this paper: Fayomi A., Pantazis Y.,
		Tsagris M. and Wood A.T.A. (2022). Cauchy robust principal
		component analysis with applications to high-dimensional data
		sets. arXiv:2211.03181.
