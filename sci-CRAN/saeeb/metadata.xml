		Small Area Estimation for Count Data // Provides small area
		estimation for count data type and gives option whether to use
		covariates in the estimation or not. By implementing Empirical
		Bayes (EB) Poisson-Gamma model, each function returns EB
		estimators and mean squared error (MSE) estimators for each
		area. The EB estimators without covariates are obtained using
		the model proposed by Clayton  Kaldor (1987)
		doi:10.2307/2532003, the EB estimators with covariates are
		obtained using the model proposed by Wakefield (2006)
		doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxl008 and the MSE estimators are
		obtained using Jackknife method by Jiang et. al. (2002)
		doi:10.1214/aos/1043351257.
