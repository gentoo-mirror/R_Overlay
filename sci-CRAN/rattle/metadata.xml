		Graphical User Interface for Data Science in R // The R Analytic
		Tool To Learn Easily (Rattle) provides a collection of
		utilities functions for the data scientist. A Gnome (RGtk2)
		based graphical interface is included with the aim to provide a
		simple and intuitive introduction to R for data science,
		allowing a user to quickly load data from a CSV file (or via
		ODBC), transform and explore the data, build and evaluate
		models, and export models as PMML (predictive modelling markup
		language) or as scores. A key aspect of the GUI is that all R
		commands are logged and commented through the log tab. This can
		be saved as a standalone R script file and as an aid for the
		user to learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into R itself.
