		Graphical User Interface for Data Science in R // The R Analytic
		Tool To Learn Easily (Rattle) provides a Gnome (RGtk2) based
		interface to R functionality for data science. The aim is to
		provide a simple and intuitive interface that allows a user to
		quickly load data from a CSV file (or via ODBC), transform and
		explore the data, build and evaluate models, and export models
		as PMML (predictive modelling markup language) or as scores.
		All of this with knowing little about R. All R commands are
		logged and commented through the log tab. Thus they are
		available to the user as a script file or as an aide for the
		user to learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into R itself.
		Rattle also exports a number of utility functions and the
		graphical user interface, invoked as rattle(),  does not need
		to be run to deploy these.
