		Assessing the Partial Association Between Ordinal Variables // An
		implementation of the unified framework for assessing partial
		association between ordinal variables after adjusting for a set
		of covariates (Dungang Liu, Shaobo Li, Yan Yu and Irini
		Moustaki (2020), accepted by the Journal of the American
		Statistical Association). This package provides a set of tools
		to quantify, visualize, and test partial associations between
		multiple ordinal variables. It can produce a number of $phi$
		measures, partial regression plots, 3-D plots, and $p$-values
		for testing $H_0: phi=0$ or $H_0: phi = delta$.
