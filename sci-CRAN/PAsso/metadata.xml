		Assessing the Partial Association Between Ordinal Variables // An
		implementation of the unified framework for assessing partial
		association between ordinal variables after adjusting a set of
		covariates (Dungang Liu, Shaobo Li, Yan Yu and Irini Moustaki
		(2020). Accepted by JASA). This package provides a set of tools
		to quantify partial association, conduct hypothesis testing for
		partial association, visualize partial regression models, and
		diagnose the specifications of each fitted model. This
		framework is based on the surrogate approach described in Liu
		and Zhang (2017) (doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915).
