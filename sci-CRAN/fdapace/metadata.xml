		Functional Data Analysis and Empirical Dynamics // A versatile
		package that provides implementation of various methods of
		Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Empirical Dynamics. The core
		of this package is Functional Principal Component Analysis
		(FPCA), a key technique for functional data analysis, for
		sparsely or densely sampled random trajectories and time
		courses, via the Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation
		(PACE) algorithm. This core algorithm yields covariance and
		mean functions, eigenfunctions and principal component
		(scores), for both functional data and derivatives, for both
		dense (functional) and sparse (longitudinal) sampling designs.
		For sparse designs, it provides fitted continuous trajectories
		with confidence bands, even for subjects with very few
		longitudinal observations. PACE is a viable and flexible
		alternative to random effects modeling of longitudinal data.
		There is also a Matlab version (PACE) that contains some
		methods not available on fdapace and vice versa. Updates to
		fdapace were supported by grants from NIH Echo and NSF
		DMS-1712864 and DMS-2014626. Please cite our package if you use
		it (You may run the command citation("fdapace") to get the
		citation format and bibtex entry). References: Wang, J.L.,
