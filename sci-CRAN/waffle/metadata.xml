		Create Waffle Chart Visualizations // Square pie charts (a.k.a.
		waffle charts) can be used to communicate parts of a whole for
		categorical quantities. To emulate the percentage view of a pie
		chart, a 10x10 grid should be used with each square
		representing 1% of the total. Modern uses of waffle charts do
		not necessarily adhere to this rule and can be created with a
		grid of any rectangular shape. Best practices suggest keeping
		the number of categories small, just as should be done when
		creating pie charts. Tools are provided to create waffle charts
		as well as stitch them together, and to use glyphs for making
		isotype pictograms.
