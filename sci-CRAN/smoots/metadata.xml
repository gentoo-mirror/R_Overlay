		Nonparametric Estimation of the Trend and Its Derivatives in TS
		// The nonparametric trend and its derivatives in equidistant
		time series (TS) with short-memory stationary errors can be
		estimated. The estimation is conducted via local polynomial
		regression using an automatically selected bandwidth obtained
		by a built-in iterative plug-in algorithm or a bandwidth fixed
		by the user. A Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoother is also built-in
		as a comparison. The methods of the package are described in
		Feng, Y., and Gries, T., (2017) http://groups.uni-
		paderborn.de/wp-wiwi/RePEc/pdf/ciepap/WP102.pdf. A current
		version of the paper that is also referred to in the
		documentation of the functions is prepared for publication.
