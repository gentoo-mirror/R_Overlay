		Nonparametric Estimation of the Trend and Its Derivatives in TS
		// The nonparametric trend and its derivatives in equidistant
		time series (TS) with short-memory stationary errors can be
		estimated. The estimation is conducted via local polynomial
		regression using an automatically selected bandwidth obtained
		by a built-in iterative plug-in algorithm or a bandwidth fixed
		by the user. A Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoother is also built-in
		as a comparison. With version 1.1.0, a linearity test for the
		trend function, forecasting methods and backtesting approaches
		are implemented as well. The smoothing methods of the package
		are described in Feng, Y., Gries, T., and Fritz, M. (2020)
