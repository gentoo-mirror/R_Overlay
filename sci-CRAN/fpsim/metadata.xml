		Compute Measures of Foreign Policy Similarity/Agreement //
		Provides functions for calculating various measures of foreign
		policy similarity or association commonly used in the study of
		international relations. These include Signorino and Ritter's S
		statistic (weighted and unweighted), Cohen's weighted kappa,
		Scott's pi, and Kendall's tau-b. The package facilitates the
		generation of dyadic similarity scores for empirical analyses
		and can also serve as an educational resource for understanding
		how such measures are derived.
