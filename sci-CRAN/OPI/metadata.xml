		Open Perimetry Interface // Implementation of the Open Perimetry
		Interface (OPI) for simulating and controlling visual field
		machines using R. The OPI is a standard for interfacing with
		visual field testing machines (perimeters). It specifies basic
		functions that allow many visual field tests to be constructed.
		As of October 2017 it is fully implemented on the Octopus 900
		and partially on the Heidelberg Edge Perimeter, the Kowa AP
		7000, the CrewT imo and the Centervue Compass. It also has a
		cousin: the R package 'visualFields', which has tools for
		analysing and manipulating visual field data.
