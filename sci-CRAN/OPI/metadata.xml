		Open Perimetry Interface // Implementation of the Open Perimetry
		Interface (OPI) for simulating and controlling visual field
		machines using R. The OPI is a standard for interfacing with
		visual field testing machines (perimeters) first started as an
		open source project with support of Haag-Streit in 2010. It
		specifies basic functions that allow many visual field tests to
		be constructed. As of February 2022 it is fully implemented on
		the Haag-Streit Octopus 900 with partial implementations on the
		Centervue Compass, Kowa AP 7000, Android phones and the CrewT
		IMO. It also has a cousin: the R package 'visualFields', which
		has tools for analysing and manipulating visual field data.
