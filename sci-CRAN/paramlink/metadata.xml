		Parametric Linkage and Other Pedigree Analysis in R // A suite of
		tools for analysing pedigrees with marker data, including
		parametric linkage analysis, forensic computations, relatedness
		analysis and marker simulations. The core of the package is an
		implementation of the Elston-Stewart algorithm for pedigree
		likelihoods, extended to allow mutations as well as complex
		inbreeding. Features for linkage analysis include singlepoint
		LOD scores, power analysis, and multipoint analysis (the latter
		through a wrapper to the 'MERLIN' software). Forensic
		applications include exclusion probabilities, genotype
		distributions and conditional simulations. Data from the
		'Familias' software can be imported and analysed in
		'paramlink'. Finally, 'paramlink' offers many utility functions
		for creating, manipulating and plotting pedigrees with or
		without marker data (the actual plotting is done by the
		'kinship2' package).
