		Measuring the Stability of Dimension Reduction and Cluster
		Assignment in scRNA-Seq Experiments // Provides functions for
		evaluating the stability of low-dimensional embeddings and
		cluster assignments in singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)
		datasets. Starting from a principal component analysis (PCA)
		object, users can generate multiple replicates of tDistributed
		Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) or Uniform Manifold
		Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embeddings. Embedding
		stability is quantified by computing pairwise Kendalls Tau
		correlations across replicates and summarizing the distribution
		of correlation coefficients. In addition to dimensionality
		reduction, 'scStability' assesses clustering consistency using
		either Louvain or Leiden algorithms and calculating the
		Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between all pairs of
		cluster assignments. For background on UMAP and t-SNE
		algorithms, see McInnes et al. (2020, doi:10.21105/joss.00861)
		and van der Maaten  Hinton (2008,
		https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne), respectively.
