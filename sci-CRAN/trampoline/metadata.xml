		Make Functions that Can Recurse Infinitely // Implements a
		trampoline algorithm for R that let's users write recursive
		functions that get around R's stack call limitations, enabling
		theoretically infinite recursion. The algorithm is based around
		generator function as implemented in the 'coro' package, and is
		based almost completely on the 'trampoline' module from Python
		https://gitlab.com/ferreum/trampoline.
