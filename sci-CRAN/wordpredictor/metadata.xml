		Develop Text Prediction Models Based on N-Grams // A framework
		for developing n-gram models for text prediction. It provides
		data cleaning, data sampling, extracting tokens from text,
		model generation, model evaluation and word prediction. For
		information on how n-gram models work we referred to: "Speech
		and Language Processing"
		https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf. For optimizing R
		code and using R6 classes we referred to "Advanced R"
		https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html. For writing R extensions we
		referred to "R Packages", https://r-pkgs.org/index.html.
