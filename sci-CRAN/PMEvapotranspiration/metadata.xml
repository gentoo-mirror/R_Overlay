		Calculation of the Penman-Monteith Evapotranspiration using
		Weather Variables // The Food and Agriculture Organization-56
		Penman-Monteith is one of the important method for estimating
		evapotranspiration from vegetated land areas. This package
		helps to calculate reference evapotranspiration using the
		weather variables collected from weather station.
		Evapotranspiration is the process of water transfer from the
		land surface to the atmosphere through evaporation from soil
		and other surfaces and transpiration from plants. The package
		aims to support agricultural, hydrological, and environmental
		research by offering accurate and accessible reference
		evapotranspiration calculation. This package has been developed
		using concept of Crdova et al.
		(2015)doi:10.1016/j.apm.2022.09.004 and Debnath et al. (2015)
