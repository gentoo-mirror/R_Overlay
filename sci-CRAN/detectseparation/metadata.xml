		Detect and Check for Separation and Infinite Maximum Likelihood
		Estimates // Provides pre-fit and post-fit methods for
		detecting separation and infinite maximum likelihood estimates
		in generalized linear models with categorical responses. The
		pre-fit methods apply on binomial-response generalized liner
		models such as logit, probit and cloglog regression, and can be
		directly supplied as fitting methods to the glm() function.
		They solve the linear programming problems for the detection of
		separation developed in Konis (2007, https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objec
		ts/uuid:8f9ee0d0-d78e-4101-9ab4-f9cbceed2a2a) using 'ROI'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=ROI or 'lpSolveAPI'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=lpSolveAPI. The post-fit
		methods apply to models with categorical responses, including
		binomial-response generalized linear models and multinomial-
		response models, such as baseline category logits and adjacent
		category logits models; for example, the models implemented in
		the 'brglm2' https://cran.r-project.org/package=brglm2 package.
		The post-fit methods successively refit the model with
		increasing number of iteratively reweighted least squares
		iterations, and monitor the ratio of the estimated standard
		error for each parameter to what it has been in the first
		iteration. According to the results in Lesaffre  Albert (1989,
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345845), divergence of those
		ratios indicates data separation.
