		Estimate Graphical Models from Multiple Types of Datasets and
		Construct Networks // Provides an equivalent measure of partial
		correlation coefficients for high-dimensional Gaussian
		Graphical Models to learn and visualize the underlying
		relationships between variables from single or multiple
		datasets. You can refer to doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1012391
		for more detail. Based on this method, the package also
		provides the method for constructing networks for Next
		Generation Sequencing Data.
