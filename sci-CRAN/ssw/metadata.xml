		Striped Smith-Waterman Algorithm for Sequence Alignment using
		SIMD // Provides an R interface for 'SSW' (Striped Smith-
		Waterman) via its 'Python' binding 'ssw-py'. 'SSW' is a fast
		'C' and 'C++' implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm
		for pairwise sequence alignment using Single-Instruction-
		Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions. 'SSW' enhances the standard
		algorithm by efficiently returning alignment information and
		suboptimal alignment scores. The core 'SSW' library offers
		performance improvements for various bioinformatics tasks,
		including protein database searches, short-read alignments,
		primary and split-read mapping, structural variant detection,
		and read-overlap graph generation. These features make 'SSW'
		particularly useful for genomic applications. Zhao et al.
		(2013) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0082138 developed the original
		'C' and 'C++' implementation.
