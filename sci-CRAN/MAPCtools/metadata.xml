		Multivariate Age-Period-Cohort (MAPC) Modeling for Health Data //
		Bayesian multivariate age-period-cohort (MAPC) models for
		analyzing health data, with support for model fitting,
		visualization, stratification, and model comparison. Inference
		focuses on identifiable cross-strata differences, as described
		by Riebler and Held (2010) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxp037.
		Methods for handling complex survey data via the 'survey'
		package are included, as described in Mercer et al. (2014)
		doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2013.12.001.
