		Dynamic Trees for Learning and Design // Inference by sequential
		Monte Carlo for dynamic tree regression and classification
		models with hooks provided for sequential design and
		optimization, fully online learning with drift, variable
		selection, and sensitivity analysis of inputs.  Illustrative
		examples from the original dynamic trees paper (Gramacy, Taddy
		Polson (2011); doi:10.1198/jasa.2011.ap09769) are facilitated
		by demos in the package; see demo(package="dynaTree").
