		Bias Reduction in Generalized Linear Models // Estimation and
		inference from generalized linear models based on various
		methods for bias reduction. The 'brglmFit' fitting method can
		achieve reduction of estimation bias by solving either the mean
		bias-reducing adjusted score equations in Firth (1993)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/80.1.27 and Kosmidis and Firth (2009)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asp055, or the median bias-reduction
		adjusted score equations in Kenne et al. (2016)
		arXiv:1604.04768, or through the direct subtraction of an
		estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator from
		the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and McCullagh
		(1991) http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592. Estimation in all
		cases takes place via a quasi Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3
		methods for the construction of of confidence intervals for the
		reduced-bias estimates are provided. In the special case of
		generalized linear models for binomial and multinomial
		responses (both ordinal and nominal), the adjusted score
		approaches return estimates with improved frequentist
		properties, that are also always finite, even in cases where
		the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete
		and quasi-complete separation). 'brglm2' also provides pre-fit
		and post-fit methods for detecting separation and infinite
		maximum likelihood estimates in binomial response generalized
		linear models.
