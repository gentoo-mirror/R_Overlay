		Bias Reduction in Generalized Linear Models // Estimation and
		inference from generalized linear models based on various
		methods for bias reduction and maximum penalized likelihood
		with powers of the Jeffreys prior as penalty. The 'brglmFit'
		fitting method can achieve reduction of estimation bias by
		solving either the mean bias-reducing adjusted score equations
		in Firth (1993) doi:10.1093/biomet/80.1.27 and Kosmidis and
		Firth (2009) doi:10.1093/biomet/asp055, or the median bias-
		reduction adjusted score equations in Kenne et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asx046, or through the direct subtraction of
		an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator
		from the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and
		McCullagh (1991) http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592. See
		Kosmidis et al (2020) doi:10.1007/s11222-019-09860-6 for more
		details. Estimation in all cases takes place via a quasi Fisher
		scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the construction of of
		confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates are
		provided. In the special case of generalized linear models for
		binomial and multinomial responses (both ordinal and nominal),
		the adjusted score approaches to mean and media bias reduction
		have been found to return estimates with improved frequentist
		properties, that are also always finite, even in cases where
		the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete
		and quasi-complete separation; see Kosmidis and Firth, 2020
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa052, for a proof for mean bias reduction
		in logistic regression). 'brglm2' also provides pre-fit and
		post-fit methods for detecting separation and infinite maximum
		likelihood estimates in binomial response generalized linear
		models.
