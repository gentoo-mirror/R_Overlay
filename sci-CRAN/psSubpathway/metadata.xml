		Flexible Identification of Phenotype-Specific Subpathways // A
		network-based systems biology tool for flexible identification
		of phenotype-specific subpathways in the cancer gene expression
		data with multiple categories (such as multiple subtype or
		developmental stages of cancer). Subtype Set Enrichment
		Analysis (SubSEA) and Dynamic Changed Subpathway Analysis
		(DCSA) are developed to flexible identify subtype specific and
		dynamic changed subpathways respectively. The operation modes
		include extraction of subpathways from biological pathways,
		inference of subpathway activities in the context of gene
		expression data, identification of subtype specific subpathways
		with SubSEA, identification of dynamic changed subpathways
		associated with the cancer developmental stage with DCSA, and
		visualization of the activities of resulting subpathways by
		using box plots and heat maps. Its capabilities render the tool
		could find the specific abnormal subpathways in the cancer
		dataset with multi-phenotype samples.
