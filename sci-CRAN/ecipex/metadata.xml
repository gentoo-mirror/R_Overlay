		Efficient Calculation of Fine Structure Isotope Patterns via
		Fourier Transforms of Simplex-Based Elemental Models //
		Provides a function that quickly computes the fine structure
		isotope patterns of a set of chemical formulas to a given
		degree of accuracy (up to the limit set by errors in floating
		point arithmetic). A data-set comprising the masses and
		isotopic abundances of individual elements is also provided and
		calculation of isotopic gross structures is also supported.
