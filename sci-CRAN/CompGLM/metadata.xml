		Conway-Maxwell-Poisson GLM and Distribution Functions // A
		function (which uses a similar interface to the `glm' function)
		for the fitting of a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson GLM. There are also
		various methods for analysis of the model fit. The package also
		contains functions for the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution
		in a similar interface to functions `dpois', `ppois' and
		`rpois'. The functions are generally quick, since the workhorse
		functions are written in C++ (thanks to the Rcpp package).
