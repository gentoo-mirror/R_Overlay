		Analysis of Data from Limiting Dilution Assay (LDA) with or
		without Cellular Cooperation // Cellular cooperation
		compromises the established method of calculating clonogenic
		activity from limiting dilution assay (LDA) data. This tool
		provides functions that enable robust analysis in presence or
		absence of cellular cooperation. The implemented method
		incorporates the same cooperativity module to model the non-
		linearity associated with cellular cooperation as known from
		the colony formation assay (Brix et al. (2021)
