		Methods for combining independent subset Markov chain Monte Carlo
		(MCMC) posterior samples to estimate a posterior density given
		the full data set // Recent Bayesian Markov chain Monto Carlo
		(MCMC) methods have been developed for big data sets that are
		too large to be analyzed using traditional statistical methods.
		These methods partition the data into non-overlapping subsets,
		and perform parallel independent Bayesian MCMC analyses on the
		data subsets, creating independent subposterior samples for
		each data subset. These independent subposterior samples are
		combined through four functions in this package, including
		averaging across subset samples, weighted averaging across
		subsets samples, and kernel smoothing across subset samples.
		The four functions assume the user has previously run the
		Bayesian analysis and has produced the independent subposterior
		samples outside of the package; the functions use as input the
		array of subposterior samples. The methods have been
		demonstrated to be useful for Bayesian MCMC models including
		Bayesian logistic regression, Bayesian Gaussian mixture models
		and Bayesian hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models. The methods are
		appropriate for Bayesian hierarchical models with
		hyperparameters, as long as data values in a single level of
		the hierarchy are not split into subsets.
