		Combining Subset MCMC Samples to Estimate a Posterior Density //
		See Miroshnikov and Conlon (2014)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0108425. Recent Bayesian Markov chain
		Monto Carlo (MCMC) methods have been developed for big data
		sets that are too large to be analyzed using traditional
		statistical methods. These methods partition the data into non-
		overlapping subsets, and perform parallel independent Bayesian
		MCMC analyses on the data subsets, creating independent
		subposterior samples for each data subset. These independent
		subposterior samples are combined through four functions in
		this package, including averaging across subset samples,
		weighted averaging across subsets samples, and kernel smoothing
		across subset samples. The four functions assume the user has
		previously run the Bayesian analysis and has produced the
		independent subposterior samples outside of the package; the
		functions use as input the array of subposterior samples. The
		methods have been demonstrated to be useful for Bayesian MCMC
		models including Bayesian logistic regression, Bayesian
		Gaussian mixture models and Bayesian hierarchical Poisson-Gamma
		models. The methods are appropriate for Bayesian hierarchical
		models with hyperparameters, as long as data values in a single
		level of the hierarchy are not split into subsets.
