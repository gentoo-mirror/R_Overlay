		Analyses of Text using Transformers Models from HuggingFace,
		Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning // Link R with
		Transformers from Hugging Face to transform text variables to
		word embeddings; where the word embeddings are used to
		statistically test the mean difference between set of texts,
		compute semantic similarity scores between texts, predict
		numerical variables, and visual statistically significant words
		according to various dimensions etc. For more information see
