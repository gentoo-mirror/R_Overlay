		Dynamic Path Analysis of Survival Data via Aalen's Additive
		Hazards Model // Dynamic path analysis with estimation of the
		corresponding direct, indirect, and total effects, based on
		Fosen et al., (2006) doi:10.1007/s10985-006-9004-2. The main
		outcome of interest is a counting process from survival
		analysis (or recurrent events) data. At each time of event,
		ordinary linear regression is used to estimate the relation
		between the covariates, while Aalen's additive hazard model is
		used for the regression of the counting process on the
		covariates.
