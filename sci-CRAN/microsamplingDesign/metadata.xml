		Finding Optimal Microsampling Designs for Non-Compartmental
		Pharmacokinetic Analysis // Find optimal microsampling designs
		for non-compartmental pharacokinetic analysis using a  general
		simulation methodology: Algorithm III of Barnett, Helen, Helena
		Geys, Tom Jacobs, and Thomas Jaki. (2017) "Optimal Designs for
		Non-Compartmental Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Studies.
		(currently unpublished)" This methodology consist of (1)
		specifying a pharmacokinetic model including variability among
		animals; (2) generating possible sampling times; (3) evaluating
		performance of each time point choice on simulated data; (4)
		generating possible schemes given a time point choice and
		additional constraints and finally (5) evaluating scheme
		performance on simulated data. The default settings differ from
		the article of Barnett and others, in the default
		pharmacokinetic model used and the parameterization of
		variability among animals. Details can be found in the package
		vignette. A 'shiny' web application is included, which guides
		users from model parametrization to optimal microsampling
		scheme.
