		Explanation of Predictions for Classification and Regression
		Models // Generates explanations for classification and
		regression models and visualizes them. Explanations are
		generated for individual predictions as well as for models as a
		whole. Two explanation methods are included, EXPLAIN and IME.
		The EXPLAIN method is fast but might miss explanations
		expressed redundantly in the model. The IME method is slower as
		it samples from all feature subsets. For the EXPLAIN method see
		Robnik-Sikonja and Kononenko (2008)
		doi:10.1109/TKDE.2007.190734, and the IME method is described
		in Strumbelj and Kononenko (2010, JMLR, vol. 11:1-18). All
		models in package 'CORElearn' are natively supported, for other
		prediction models a wrapper function is provided and
		illustrated for models from packages 'randomForest', 'nnet',
		and 'e1071'.
