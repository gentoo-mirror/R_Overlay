		Slide Automation for Tables, Listings and Figures // The normal
		process of creating clinical study slides is that a
		statistician manually type in the numbers from outputs and a
		separate statistician to double check the typed in numbers.
		This process is time consuming, resource intensive, and error
		prone. Automatic slide generation is a solution to address
		these issues. It reduces the amount of work and the required
		time when creating slides, and reduces the risk of errors from
		manually typing or copying numbers from the output to slides.
		It also helps users to avoid unnecessary stress when creating
		large amounts of slide decks in a short time window.
