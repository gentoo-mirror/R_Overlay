		Bridging Simultaneous Confidence Corridors and PET Neuroimaging
		// Tools for the structured processing of PET neuroimaging data
		in preparation for the estimation of Simultaneous Confidence
		Corridors (SCCs) for one-group, two-group, or single-patient vs
		group comparisons. The package facilitates PET image loading,
		data restructuring, integration into a Functional Data Analysis
		framework, contour extraction, identification of significant
		results, and performance evaluation. It bridges established
		packages (e.g., 'oro.nifti') with novel statistical
		methodologies (e.g., 'ImageSCC') and enables reproducible
		analysis pipelines, including comparison with Statistical
		Parametric Mapping ('SPM').
