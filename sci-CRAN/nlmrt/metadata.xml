		Functions for Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions // Replacement
		for nls() tools for working with nonlinear least squares
		problems. The calling structure is similar to, but much simpler
		than, that of the nls() function. Moreover, where nls()
		specifically does NOT deal with small or zero residual
		problems, nlmrt is quite happy to solve them. It also attempts
		to be more robust in finding solutions, thereby avoiding
		'singular gradient' messages that arise in the Gauss-Newton
		method within nls(). The Marquardt-Nash approach in nlmrt
		generally works more reliably to get a solution, though this
		may be one of a set of possibilities, and may also be
		statistically unsatisfactory. Added print and summary as of
		August 28, 2012.
