		Discrete Goodness-of-Fit Tests // A revision to the
		stats::ks.test() function and the associated ks.test.Rd help
		page. With one minor exception, it does not change the existing
		behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features necessary for doing
		one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete distributions. The
		package also contains cvm.test(), for doing one-sample Cramer-
		von Mises goodness-of-fit tests.
