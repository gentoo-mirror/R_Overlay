		Linear Model Evaluation with Randomized Residuals in a
		Permutation Procedure // Linear model calculations are made for
		many random versions of data. Using residual randomization in a
		permutation procedure, sums of squares are calculated over many
		permutations to generate empirical probability distributions
		for evaluating model effects.  Additionally, coefficients,
		statistics, fitted values, and residuals generated over many
		permutations can be used for various procedures including
		pairwise tests, prediction, classification, and model
		comparison.  This package should provide most tools one could
		need for the analysis of high-dimensional data, especially in
		ecology and evolutionary biology, but certainly other fields,
		as well.
