		Linear Model Evaluation with Randomized Residuals in a
		Permutation Procedure // Linear model calculations are made for
		many random versions of data. Using residual randomization in a
		permutation procedure, sums of squares are calculated over many
		permutations to generate empirical probability distributions
		for evaluating model effects.  This method is described by
		Collyer, Sekora,  Adams (2015) doi:10.1038/hdy.2014.75.
