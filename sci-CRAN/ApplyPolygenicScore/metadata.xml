		Utilities for the Application of a Polygenic Score to a VCF //
		Simple and transparent parsing of genotype/dosage data from an
		input Variant Call Format (VCF) file, matching of genotype
		coordinates to the component Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
		(SNPs) of an existing polygenic score (PGS), and application of
		SNP weights to dosages for the calculation of a polygenic score
		for each individual in accordance with the additive weighted
		sum of dosages model. Methods are designed in reference to best
		practices described by Collister, Liu, and Clifton (2022)
