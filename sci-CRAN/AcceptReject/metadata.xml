		Acceptance-Rejection Method for Generating Pseudo-Random
		Observations // Provides a function that implements the
		acceptance-rejection method in an optimized manner to generate
		pseudo-random observations for discrete or continuous random
		variables. Proposed by von Neumann J. (1951),
		https://mcnp.lanl.gov/pdf_files/, the function is optimized to
		work in parallel on Unix-based operating systems and performs
		well on Windows systems. The acceptance-rejection method
		implemented optimizes the probability of generating
		observations from the desired random variable, by simply
		providing the probability function or probability density
		function, in the discrete and continuous cases, respectively.
		Implementation is based on references CASELLA, George at al.

		(2003) https://www.jstor.org/stable/3448413 and Bishop,
		Christopher M. (2006, ISBN: 978-0387310732).
