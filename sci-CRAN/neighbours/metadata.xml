		Neighbourhood Functions for Local-Search Algorithms //
		Neighbourhood functions are key components of local-search
		algorithms such as Simulated Annealing or Threshold Accepting.
		These functions take a solution and return a slightly-modified
		copy of it, i.e. a neighbour. The package provides a function
		neighbourfun() that constructs such neighbourhood functions,
		based on parameters such as admissible ranges for elements in a
		solution.  Supported are numeric and logical solutions. The
		algorithms were originally created for portfolio-optimisation
		applications, but can be used for other models as well.
		Several recipes for neighbour computations are taken from
		"Numerical Methods and Optimization in Finance" by M. Gilli, D.
		Maringer and E. Schumann (2019, ISBN:978-0128150658).
