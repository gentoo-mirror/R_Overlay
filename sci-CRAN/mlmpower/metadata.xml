		Power Analysis and Data Simulation for Multilevel Models // A
		declarative language for specifying multilevel models, solving
		for population parameters based on specified variance-explained
		effect size measures, generating data, and conducting power
		analyses to determine sample size recommendations. The
		specification allows for any number of within-cluster effects,
		between-cluster effects, covariate effects at either level, and
		random coefficients. Moreover, the models do not assume
		orthogonal effects, and predictors can correlate at either
		level and accommodate models with multiple interaction effects.
