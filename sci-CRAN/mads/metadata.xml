		Multi-Analysis Distance Sampling // Performs distance sampling
		analyses on a number of species at once and can account for
		unidentified sightings, model uncertainty and covariate
		uncertainty. Unidentified sightings refer to sightings which
		cannot be allocated to a single species but may instead be
		allocated to a group of species. The abundance of each
		unidentified group is estimated and then prorated to the
		species estimates. Model uncertainty should be incorporated
		when multiple models give equally good fit to the data but lead
		to large differences in estimated density / abundance.
		Covariate uncertainty should be incorporated when covariates
		cannot be measured accurately, for example this is often the
		case for group size in marine mammal surveys. Variance
		estimation for these methods is via a non parametric bootstrap.
		The methods implemented are described in Gerodette T. and
		Forcada J. (2005) doi:10.3354/meps291001 Non-recovery of two
		spotted and spinner dolphin populations in the eastern tropical
		Pacific Ocean.
