		Fast Fixed-Effects Estimations // Fast and user-friendly
		estimation of econometric models with multiple fixed-effects.
		Includes ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized linear
		models (GLM) and the negative binomial. The core of the package
		is based on optimized parallel C++ code, scaling especially
		well for large data sets. The method to obtain the fixed-
		effects coefficients is based on Berge (2018) https://wwwen.uni
		.lu/content/download/110162/1299525/file/2018_13. Further
		provides tools to export and view the results of several
		estimations with intuitive design to cluster the standard-
		errors.
