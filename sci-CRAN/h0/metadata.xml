		A Meta Analysis for Estimating the Hubble Constant via Time Delay
		Cosmography // We provide a toolbox to conduct a meta analysis
		for estimating the current expansion rate of the Universe,
		called the Hubble constant H0, via time delay cosmography. The
		input data are (i) estimates of Fermat potential differences
		and their one-sigma uncertainties (standard errors), and (ii)
		estimates of time delays and their one-sigma uncertainties.
		Given these inputs, the meta analysis conducts a maximum
		likelihood estimation or a Bayesian inference to infer the
		Hubble constant.
