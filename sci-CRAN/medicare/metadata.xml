		Tools for Obtaining and Cleaning Medicare Public Use Files //
		Publicly available data from Medicare frequently requires
		extensive initial effort to extract desired variables and merge
		them; this package formalizes the techniques I've found work
		best. More information on the Medicare program, as well as
		guidance for the publicly available data this package targets,
		can be found on CMS's website covering publicly available data.
