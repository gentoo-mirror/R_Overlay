		Interface Between 'GRASS' Geographical Information System and 'R'
		// An interface between the 'GRASS' geographical information
		system ('GIS') and 'R', based on starting 'R' from within the
		'GRASS' 'GIS' environment, or running a free-standing 'R'
		session in a temporary 'GRASS' location; the package provides
		facilities for using all 'GRASS' commands from the 'R' command
		line. The original interface package for 'GRASS 5' (2000-2010)
		is described in Bivand (2000) doi:10.1016/S0098-3004(00)00057-1
		and Bivand (2001) https://www.r-project.org/conferences/DSC-200
		1/Proceedings/Bivand.pdf. This was succeeded by 'spgrass6' for
		'GRASS 6' (2006-2016) and 'rgrass7' for 'GRASS 7'
		(2015-present). The 'rgrass' package modernizes the interface
		for 'GRASS 8' while still permitting the use of 'GRASS 7'.
