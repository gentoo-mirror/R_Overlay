		Genome Synteny Visualization // Draw syntenic relationships
		between genome assemblies. There are 3 functions which take a
		tab delimited file containing alignment data for syntenic
		blocks between genomes to produce either a linear alignment
		plot, an evolution highway style plot, or a painted ideogram
		representing syntenic relationships. There is also a function
		to convert alignment data in the DESCHRAMBLER/inferCAR format
		to the required data structure.
