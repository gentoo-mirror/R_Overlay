		Surrogate Outcome Regression Analysis // Performs estimation and
		inference on a partially missing target outcome (e.g. gene
		expression in an inaccessible tissue) while borrowing
		information from a correlated surrogate outcome (e.g. gene
		expression in an accessible tissue). Rather than regarding the
		surrogate outcome as a proxy for the target outcome, this
		package jointly models the target and surrogate outcomes within
		a bivariate regression framework. Unobserved values of either
		outcome are treated as missing data. In contrast to imputation-
		based inference, no assumptions are required regarding the
		relationship between the target and surrogate outcomes.
		Estimation in the presence of bilateral outcome missingness is
		performed via an expectation conditional maximization either
		algorithm. In the case of unilateral target missingness,
		estimation is performed using an accelerated least squares
		procedure. A flexible association test is provided for
		evaluating hypotheses about the target regression parameters.

		partially missing target outcome" doi:10.1111/biom.13629.
