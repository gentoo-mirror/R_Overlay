		Surrogate Outcome Regression Analysis // Performs estimation and
		inference on a partially missing target outcome while borrowing
		information from a correlated surrogate outcome to increase
		estimation precision and improve power. The target and
		surrogate outcomes are jointly modeled within a bivariate
		outcome regression framework. Unobserved values of either
		outcome are regarded as missing data. Estimation in the
		presence of bilateral outcome missingness is performed via an
		expectation conditional maximization algorithm. A flexible
		association test is provided for evaluating hypotheses about
		the target regression parameters. See McCaw ZR, Gaynor SM, Sun
		R, Lin X; Cross-tissue eQTL mapping in the presence of missing
		data via surrogate outcome analysis
