		Reliable Comparison of Floating Point Numbers // Comparisons of
		floating point numbers are problematic due to errors associated
		with the binary representation of decimal numbers. Despite
		being aware of these problems, people still use numerical
		methods that fail to account for these and other rounding
		errors (this pitfall is the first to be highlighted in Circle 1
		of Burns (2012) 'The R Inferno' https://www.burns-
		stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf). This package provides new
		relational operators useful for performing floating point
		number comparisons with a set tolerance.
