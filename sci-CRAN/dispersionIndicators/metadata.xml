		Indicators for the Analysis of Dispersion of Datasets with
		Batched and Ordered Samples // Provides methods for analyzing
		the dispersion of tabular datasets with batched and ordered
		samples. Based on convex hull or integrated covariance
		Mahalanobis, several indicators are implemented for inter and
		intra batch dispersion analysis. It is designed to facilitate
		robust statistical assessment of data variability, supporting
		applications in exploratory data analysis and quality control,
		for such datasets as the one found in metabololomics studies.
