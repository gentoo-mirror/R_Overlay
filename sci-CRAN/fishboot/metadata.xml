		Bootstrap-Based Methods for the Study of Fish Stocks and Aquatic
		Populations // A suite of bootstrap-based models and tools for
		analyzing fish stocks and aquatic populations. Designed for
		ecologists and fisheries scientists, it supports data from
		length-frequency distributions, tag-and-recapture studies, and
		hard structure readings (e.g., otoliths). See Schwamborn et
		al., 2019 doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.12.001 for background.
		The package includes functions for bootstrapped fitting of
		growth curves and plotting.
