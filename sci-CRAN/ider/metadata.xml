		Various Methods for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension // An
		implementation of various methods for estimating intrinsic
		dimension of vector-valued dataset or distance matrix. Most
		methods implemented are based on different notion of fractal
		dimension such as the capacity dimension, the box-counting
		dimension, and the information dimension.
