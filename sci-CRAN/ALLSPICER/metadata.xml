		ALLelic Spectrum of Pleiotropy Informed Correlated Effects //
		Provides statistical tools to analyze heterogeneous effects of
		rare variants within genes that are associated with multiple
		traits. The package implements methods for assessing
		pleiotropic effects and identifying allelic heterogeneity,
		which can be useful in large-scale genetic studies. Methods
		include likelihood-based statistical tests to assess these
		effects. For more details, see Lu et al. (2024)
