		Posterior Predictive (PoP) Design for Phase I Clinical Trials //
		The primary goal of phase I clinical trials is to find the
		maximum tolerated dose (MTD). To reach this objective, we
		introduce a new design for phase I clinical trials, the
		posterior predictive (PoP) design. The PoP design is an
		innovative model-assisted design that is as simply as the
		conventional algorithmic designs as its decision rules can be
		pre-tabulated prior to the onset of trial, but is of more
		flexibility of selecting diverse target toxicity rates and
		cohort sizes. The PoP design has desirable properties, such as
		coherence and consistency. Moreover, the PoP design provides
		better empirical performance than the BOIN and Keyboard design
		with respect to high average probabilities of choosing the MTD
		and slightly lower risk of treating patients at subtherapeutic
		or overly toxic doses.
