		Posterior Predictive (PoP) Design for Phase I Clinical Trials //
		The primary goal of phase I clinical trials is to find the
		maximum tolerated dose (MTD). To reach this objective, we
		introduce a new design for phase I clinical trials, the
		posterior predictive (PoP) design. The PoP design is an
		innovative model-assisted design that is easy to implement in a
		manner similar to the traditional 3+3 design, as its decision
		rules can be pre-tabulated prior to the onset of trial, but is
		of more flexibility of selecting diverse target toxicity rates
		and cohort sizes. The PoP design has desirable properties, such
		as coherence and consistency. Moreover, the PoP design provides
		better performance than the BOIN and Keyboard design with
		respect to high average probabilities of choosing the MTD and
		slightly lower risk of treating patients at subtherapeutic or
		overly toxic doses. Reference: Brunk, H., Barlow, R. E.,
