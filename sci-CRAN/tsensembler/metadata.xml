		Dynamic Ensembles for Time Series Forecasting // A framework for
		dynamically combining forecasting models for time series
		forecasting predictive tasks. It leverages machine learning
		models from other packages to automatically combine expert
		advice using metalearning and other state-of-the-art
		forecasting combination approaches. The predictive methods
		receive a data matrix as input, representing an embedded time
		series, and return a predictive ensemble model. The ensemble
		use generic functions 'predict()' and 'forecast()' to forecast
		future values of the time series. Moreover, an ensemble can be
		updated using methods, such as 'update_weights()' or
		'update_base_models()'. A complete description of the methods
		can be found in: Cerqueira, V., Torgo, L., Pinto, F., and
		Soares, C. "Arbitrated Ensemble for Time Series Forecasting."
		to appear at: Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and
		Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Springer International
		Publishing, 2017; and Cerqueira, V., Torgo, L., and Soares, C.:
