		Use Inverse Probability Weighting to Estimate Treatment Effect
		for Semi Competing Risks Data // Use inverse probability
		weighting methods to estimate treatment effect under marginal
		structure model for the transition hazard of semi competing
		risk data, i.e. illness death model. We implement two specific
		such models, the usual Markov illness death structural model
		and the general Markov illness death structural model. We also
		provide the estimates of three cumulative incidence function of
		the potential outcomes.
