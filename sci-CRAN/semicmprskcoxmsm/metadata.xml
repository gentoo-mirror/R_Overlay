		Use Inverse Probability Weighting to Estimate Treatment Effect
		for Semi Competing Risks Data // Use inverse probability
		weighting methods to estimate treatment effect under marginal
		structure model (MSM) for the transition hazard of semi
		competing risk data, i.e. illness death model. We implement two
		specific such models, the usual Markov illness death structural
		model and the general Markov illness death structural model. We
		also provide the predicted three risks functions from the
		marginal structure models. Zhang, Y. and Xu, R. (2022)
