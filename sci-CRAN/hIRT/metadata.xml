		Hierarchical Item Response Theory Models // Implementation of a
		class of hierarchical item response theory (IRT) models where
		both the mean and the variance of latent preferences (ability
		parameters) can depend on observed covariates. The current
		implementation includes both the two-parameter latent trait
		model and the graded response model. Both are fitted via the
		Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Asymptotic standard
		errors are derived from the observed information matrix.
