		Analysis of Disposition Effect on Financial Portfolios //
		Evaluate the presence of disposition effect and others
		irrational investor's behaviors based solely on investor's
		transactions and financial market data. Experimental data can
		also be used to perform the analysis. Four different
		methodologies are implemented to account for the different
		nature of human behaviors on financial markets. Novel analyses
		such as portfolio driven and time series disposition effect are
		also allowed.
