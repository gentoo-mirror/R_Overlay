		Coupled Chain Radiative Transfer Models // A set of radiative
		transfer models to quantitatively describe the absorption,
		reflectance and transmission of solar energy in vegetation, and
		model remotely sensed spectral signatures of vegetation at
		distinct spatial scales (leaf,canopy and stand). The main
		principle behind ccrtm is that many radiative transfer models
		can form a coupled chain, basically models that feed into each
		other in a linked chain (from leaf, to canopy, to stand, to
		atmosphere). It allows the simulation of spectral datasets in
		the solar spectrum (400-2500nm) using leaf models as PROSPECT5,
		5b, and D which can be coupled with canopy models as 'FLIM',
		'SAIL' and 'SAIL2'. Currently, only a simple atmospheric model
		('skyl') is implemented. Jacquemoud et al 2008 provide the most
		comprehensive overview of these models
