		IRT Item-Person Map with 'ConQuest' Integration // A powerful yet
		simple graphical tool available in the field of psychometrics
		is the Wright Map (also known as item maps or item-person
		maps), which presents the location of both respondents and
		items on the same scale. Wright Maps are commonly used to
		present the results of dichotomous or polytomous item response
		models. The 'WrightMap' package provides functions to create
		these plots from item parameters and person estimates stored as
		R objects. Although the package can be used in conjunction with
		any software used to estimate the IRT model (e.g. 'TAM',
		'mirt', 'eRm' or 'IRToys' in 'R', or 'Stata', 'Mplus', etc.),
		'WrightMap' features special integration with 'ConQuest' to
		facilitate reading and plotting its output directly.The
		'wrightMap' function creates Wright Maps based on person
		estimates and item parameters produced by an item response
		analysis. The 'CQmodel' function reads output files created
		using 'ConQuest' software and creates a set of data frames for
		easy data manipulation, bundled in a 'CQmodel' object. The
		'wrightMap' function can take a 'CQmodel' object as input or it
		can be used to create Wright Maps directly from data frames of
		person and item parameters.
