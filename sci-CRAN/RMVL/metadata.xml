		Mappable Vector Library for Handling Large Datasets // Mappable
		vector library provides convenient way to access large
		datasets. Use all of your data at once, with few limits. Memory
		mapped data can be shared between multiple R processes. Access
		speed depends on storage medium, so solid state drive is
		recommended, preferably with PCI Express (or M.2 nvme)
		interface or a fast network file system. The data is memory
		mapped into R and then accessed using usual R list and array
		subscription operators. Convenience functions are provided for
		merging, grouping and indexing large vectors and data.frames.
		The layout of underlying MVL files is optimized for large
		datasets. The vectors are stored to guarantee alignment for
		vector intrinsics after memory map. The package is built on top
		of libMVL, which can be used as a standalone C library. libMVL
		has simple C API making it easy to interchange datasets with
		outside programs.
