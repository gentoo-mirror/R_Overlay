		Mappable Vector Library for Handling Large Datasets // Mappable
		vector library provides convenient way to access large datasets
		on solid state drives. This bypasses limitation of physical
		memory size as well as limited bandwidth of database
		interfaces. Access speed depends on storage medium, so solid
		state drive is recommended, preferably with PCI Express (or M.2
		nvme) interface. The data is memory mapped into R and then
		accessed using usual R list and array subscription operators.
		The layout of underlying MVL files is optimized for large
		datasets. The vectors are stored to guarantee alignment for
		vector intrinsics after memory map. The package is built on top
		of libMVL, which can be used as standalone C library. libMVL
		has simple C API making it easy to interchange of datasets with
		outside programs.
