		Study Strap and Multi-Study Learning Algorithms // Implements
		multi-study learning algorithms such as merging, the study-
		specific ensemble (trained-on-observed-studies ensemble) the
		study strap, the covariate-matched study strap, covariate-
		profile similarity weighting, and stacking weights. Embedded
		within the 'caret' framework, this package allows for a wide
		range of single-study learners (e.g., neural networks, lasso,
		random forests). The package offers over 20 default similarity
		measures and allows for specification of custom similarity
		measures for covariate-profile similarity weighting and an
		accept/reject step. This implements methods described in
		Loewinger, Kishida, Patil, and Parmigiani. (2019)
