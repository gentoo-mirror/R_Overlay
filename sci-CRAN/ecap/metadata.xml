		Excess Certainty Adjusted Probability Estimate // Implements the
		Excess Certainty Adjusted Probability adjustment procedure as
		described in the paper "Irrational Exuberance: Correcting Bias
		in Probability Estimates" by Gareth James, Peter Radchenko, and
		Bradley Rava (Journal of the American Statistical Association,
		2020;  doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1787175). The package includes
		a function that preforms the ECAP adjustment and a function
		that estimates the parameters needed for implementing ECAP. For
		testing and reproducibility, the ESPN and FiveThirtyEight data
		used in the paper are also included.
