		Solve Delay Differential Equations // Solves ordinary and delay
		differential equations, where the objective function is written
		in either R or C.  Suitable only for non-stiff equations, the
		solver uses a 'Dormand-Prince' method that allows interpolation
		of the solution at any point.  This approach is as described by
		Hairer, Norsett and Wanner (1993) ISBN:3540604529.  Support is
		also included for iterating difference equations.
