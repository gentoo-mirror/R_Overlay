		Functions for Processing Accelerometer Data // A collection of
		functions that perform operations on time-series accelerometer
		data, such as identify non-wear time, flag minutes that are
		part of an activity bout, and find the maximum 10-minute
		average count value. The functions are generally very flexible,
		allowing for a variety of algorithms to be implemented. Most of
		the functions are written in C++ for efficiency.
