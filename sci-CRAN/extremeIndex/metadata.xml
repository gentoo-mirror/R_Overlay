		Forecast Verification for Extreme Events // An index measuring
		the amount of information brought by forecasts for extreme
		events, subject to calibration, is computed. This index is
		originally designed for weather or climate forecasts, but it
		may be used in other forecasting contexts. This is the
		implementation of the index in Taillardat et al. (2019)
