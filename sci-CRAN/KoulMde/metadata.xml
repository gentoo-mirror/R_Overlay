		Koul's Minimum Distance Estimation in Regression and Image
		Segmentation Problems // Many methods are developed to deal
		with two major statistical problems: image segmentation and
		nonparametric estimation in various regression models. Image
		segmentation is nowadays gaining a lot of attention from
		various scientific subfields. Especially, image segmentation
		has been popular in medical research such as magnetic resonance
		imaging (MRI) analysis. When a patient suffers from some brain
		diseases such as dementia and Parkinson's disease, those
		diseases can be easily diagnosed in brain MRI: the area
		affected by those diseases is brightly expressed in MRI, which
		is called a white lesion. For the purpose of medical research,
		locating and segment those white lesions in MRI is a critical
		issue; it can be done manually. However, manual segmentation is
		very expensive in that it is error-prone and demands a huge
		amount of time. Therefore, supervised machine learning has
		emerged as an alternative solution. Despite its powerful
		performance in a classification problem such as hand-written
		digits, supervised machine learning has not shown the same
		satisfactory result in MRI analysis. Setting aside all issues
		of the supervised machine learning, it exposed a critical
		problem when employed for MRI analysis: it requires time-
		consuming data labeling. Thus, there is a strong demand for an
		unsupervised approach, and this package - based on Hira L. Koul
		(1986) DOI:10.1214/aos/1176350059 - proposes an efficient
		method for simple image segmentation - here, "simple" means
		that an image is black-and-white - which can easily be applied
		to MRI analysis. This package includes a function
		GetSegImage(): when a black-and-white image is given as an
		input, GetSegImage() separates an area of white pixels - which
		corresponds to a white lesion in MRI - from the given image.
		For the second problem, consider linear regression model and
		autoregressive model of order q where errors in the linear
		regression model and innovations in the autoregression model
		are independent and symmetrically distributed. Hira L. Koul
		(1986) DOI:10.1214/aos/1176350059 proposed a nonparametric
		minimum distance estimation method by minimizing L2-type
		distance between certain weighted residual empirical processes.
		He also proposed a simpler version of the loss function by
		using symmetry of the integrating measure in the distance. Kim
		(2018) DOI:10.1080/00949655.2017.1392527 proposed a fast
		computational method which enables practitioners to compute the
		minimum distance estimator of the vector of general multiple
		regression parameters for several integrating measures. This
		package contains three functions: KoulLrMde(), KoulArMde(), and
		Koul2StageMde(). The former two provide minimum distance
		estimators for linear regression model and autoregression
		model, respectively, where both are based on Koul's method.
		These two functions take much less time for the computation
		than those based on parametric minimum distance estimation
		methods. Koul2StageMde() provides estimators for regression and
		autoregressive coefficients of linear regression model with
		autoregressive errors through minimum distant method of two
		stages. The new version is written in Rcpp and dramatically
		reduces computational time.
