		Koul's Minimum Distance Estimation in Linear Regression and
		Autoregression Model by Coordinate Descent Algorithm //
		Consider linear regression model and autoregressive model of
		order q where errors in the linear regression model and
		innovations in the autoregression model are independent and
		symmetrically distributed. Hira L. Koul (1986)
		DOI:10.1214/aos/1176350059 proposed a nonparametric minimum
		distance estimation method by minimizing L2-type distance
		between certain weighted residual empirical processes. He also
		proposed a simpler version of the loss function by using
		symmetry of the integrating measure in the distance. Kim (2018)
		DOI:10.1080/00949655.2017.1392527 proposed a fast computational
		method which enables practitioners to compute the minimum
		distance estimator of the vector of general multiple regression
		parameters for several integrating measures. This package
		contains three functions: KoulLrMde(), KoulArMde(), and
		Koul2StageMde(). The former two provide minimum distance
		estimators for linear regression model and autoregression
		model, respectively, where both are based on Koul's method.
		These two functions take much less time for the computation
		than those based on parametric minimum distance estimation
		methods. Koul2StageMde() provides estimators for regression and
		autoregressive coefficients of linear regression model with
		autoregressive errors through minimum distant method of two
		stages. The new version is written in Rcpp and dramatically
		reduces computational time.
