		Shiny User Interface for 'monobin' Package // This is an add-on
		package to the 'monobin' package that simplifies its use. It
		provides shiny-based user interface (UI) that is especially
		handy for less experienced 'R' users as well as for those who
		intend to perform quick scanning of numeric risk factors when
		building credit rating models. The additional functions
		implemented in 'monobinShiny' that do no exist in 'monobin'
		package are: descriptive statistics, special case and outliers
		imputation. The function descriptive statistics is exported and
		can be used in 'R' sessions independently from the user
		interface, while special case and outlier imputation functions
		are written to be used with shiny UI.
