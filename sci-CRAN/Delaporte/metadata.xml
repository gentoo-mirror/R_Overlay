		Statistical Functions for the Delaporte Distribution // Provides
		probability mass, distribution, quantile, random-variate
		generation, and method-of-moments parameter-estimation
		functions for the Delaporte distribution with parameterization
		based on Vose (2008) isbn:9780470512845. The Delaporte is a
		discrete probability distribution which can be considered the
		convolution of a negative binomial distribution with a Poisson
		distribution. Alternatively, it can be considered a counting
		distribution with both Poisson and negative binomial
		components. It has been studied in actuarial science as a
		frequency distribution which has more variability than the
		Poisson, but less than the negative binomial.
