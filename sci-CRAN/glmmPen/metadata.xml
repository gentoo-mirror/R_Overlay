		High Dimensional Penalized Generalized Linear Mixed Models
		(pGLMM) // Fits high dimensional penalized generalized linear
		mixed models using the Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional
		Minimization (MCECM) algorithm. The purpose of the package is
		to perform variable selection on both the fixed and random
		effects simultaneously for generalized linear mixed models. The
		package supports fitting of Binomial, Gaussian, and Poisson
		data with canonical links, and supports penalization using the
		MCP, SCAD, or LASSO penalties. The MCECM algorithm is described
		in Rashid et al. (2020) doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1671197. The
		techniques used in the minimization portion of the procedure
		(the M-step) are derived from the procedures of the 'ncvreg'
		package (Breheny and Huang (2011) doi:10.1214/10-AOAS388) and
		'grpreg' package (Breheny and Huang (2015)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9424-2), with appropriate modifications
		to account for the estimation and penalization of the random
		effects. The 'ncvreg' and 'grpreg' packages also describe the
		MCP, SCAD, and LASSO penalties.
