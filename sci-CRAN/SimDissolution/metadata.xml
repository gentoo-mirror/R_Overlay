		Modeling and Assessing Similarity of Drug Dissolutions Profiles
		// Implementation of a model-based bootstrap approach for
		testing whether two formulations are similar. The package
		provides a function for fitting a pharmacokinetic model to
		time-concentration data and comparing the results for all five
		candidate models regarding the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).
		The candidate set contains a First order, Hixson-Crowell,
		Higuchi, Weibull and a logistic model. The assessment of
		similarity implemented in this package is performed regarding
		the maximum deviation of the profiles. See Moellenhoff et al.
