		Build, Import and Export GEXF Graph Files // Create, read and
		write 'GEXF' (Graph Exchange 'XML' Format) graph files (used in
		'Gephi' and others). Using the 'XML' package, it allows the
		user to easily build/read graph files including attributes,
		'GEXF' visual attributes (such as color, size, and position),
		network dynamics (for both edges and nodes) and edge weighting.
		Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively
		through data-frames, visualize the graph on a web browser
		through 'gexf-js' (a 'javascript' library) and interact with
		the 'igraph' package.
