		Build, Import, and Export GEXF Graph Files // Create, read, and
		write 'GEXF' (Graph Exchange 'XML' Format) graph files (used in
		'Gephi' and others). Using the 'XML' package, rgexf allows
		reading and writing GEXF files, including attributes, 'GEXF'
		visual attributes (such as color, size, and position), network
		dynamics (for both edges and nodes), and edges' weights. Users
		can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively through
		data frames, visualize the graph on a web browser through
		'gexf-js' (a 'javascript' library), and interact with the
		'igraph' package.
