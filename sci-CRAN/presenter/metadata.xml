		Present Data with Style // Consists of custom wrapper functions
		using packages 'openxlsx', 'flextable', and 'officer' to create
		highly formatted MS office friendly output of your data frames.
		These viewer friendly outputs are intended to match
		expectations of professional looking presentations in business
		and consulting scenarios. The functions are opinionated in the
		sense that they expect the input data frame to have certain
		properties in order to take advantage of the automated
		formatting.
