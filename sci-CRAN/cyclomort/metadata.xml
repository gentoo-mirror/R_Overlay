		Survival Modeling with a Periodic Hazard Function // Modeling
		periodic mortality (or other time-to event) processes from
		right-censored data. Given observations of a process with a
		known period (e.g. 365 days, 24 hours), functions determine the
		number, intensity, timing, and duration of peaks of periods of
		elevated hazard within a period.  The underlying model is a
		mixed wrapped Cauchy function fitted using maximum likelihoods
		(details in Gurarie et al. (2020) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13305).
		The development of these tools was motivated by the strongly
		seasonal mortality patterns observed in many wild animal
		populations. Thus, the respective periods of higher mortality
		can be identified as "mortality seasons".
