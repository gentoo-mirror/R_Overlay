		Bayesian Classification and Information Sharing (BaCIS) Tool for
		the Design of Multi-Group Phase II Clinical Trials // Provides
		the design of multi-group phase II clinical trials with binary
		outcomes using the hierarchical Bayesian classification and
		information sharing (BaCIS) model. Subgroups are classified
		into two clusters on the basis of their outcomes mimicking the
		hypothesis testing framework. Subsequently, information sharing
		takes place within subgroups in the same cluster, rather than
		across all subgroups. This method can be applied to the design
		and analysis of multi-group clinical trials with binary
		outcomes.
