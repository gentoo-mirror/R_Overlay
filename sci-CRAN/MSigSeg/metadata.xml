		Multiple SIGnal SEGmentation // Traditional methods typically
		detect breakpoints from individual signals, which means that
		when applied separately to multiple signals, the breakpoints
		are not aligned. However, this package implements a common
		breakpoint detection approach for multiple piecewise constant
		signals, resulting in increased detection sensitivity and
		specificity. By employing various techniques, optimal
		performance is ensured, and computation is accelerated. We hope
		that this package will be beneficial for researchers in signal
		processing, bioinformatics, economy, and other related fields.
		The segmentation(), lambda_estimator() functions are the main
		functions of this package.
