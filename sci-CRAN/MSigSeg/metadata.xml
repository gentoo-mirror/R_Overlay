		Common Change Points Detection for Multiple Signals //
		Traditional change points detection methods do not have
		ability in detecting optimal common change points for multi-
		signal. This package implements common change points detection
		for multiple signals, can be used in bioinformatics, economics
		and many other fields. Unlike detecting single signals
		independently, this package can detect optimal common change
		points with more sensitivity and specificity. After receiving
		the collected signal, this method selects the number of change
		points and the original matrix according to the actual
		situation, solves the minimization optimization problem based
		on different input parameters, obtains the position of change
		points and processed signal. The fun_segmentation_PELT(),
		fun_lambda_estimator() functions are the main functions of this
		package.
