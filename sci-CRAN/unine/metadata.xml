		Unine Light Stemmer // Implementation of "light" stemmers for
		French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Finnish, Swedish.
		They are based on the same work as the "light" stemmers found
		in 'SolR' https://lucene.apache.org/solr/ or 'ElasticSearch'
		https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/elasticsearch. A "light"
		stemmer consists in removing inflections only for noun and
		adjectives. Indexing verbs for these languages is not of
		primary importance compared to nouns and adjectives. The
		stemming procedure for French is described in (Savoy, 1999)
		doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1999)50:10%3C944::AID-
