		Analysis of Spatial Gradients in Radiocarbon Dates // Inspired by
		space-time regressions often performed to assess the expansion
		of the Neolithic from the Near East to Europe (Pinhasi et al.
		2005 doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030410). Test for significant
		correlations between the (earliest) radiocarbon dates of
		archaeological sites and their respective distances from a
		hypothetical center of origin. Distances can be either great-
		circle or least-cost paths calculated from a friction surface.
		Both ordinary least squares (OLS) and reduced major axis (RMA)
		methods are supported (Russell et al. 2014
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087854). It is also possible to
		iterate over many sites to identify the most likely origin.
