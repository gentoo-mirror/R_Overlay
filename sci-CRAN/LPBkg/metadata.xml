		Detecting New Signals under Background Mismodelling // Given a
		postulated model and a set of data, the comparison density is
		estimated and the deviance test is implemented in order to
		assess if the data distribution deviates significantly from the
		postulated model. Finally, the results are summarized in a CD-
		plot as described in Algeri S. (2019) arXiv:1906.06615.
