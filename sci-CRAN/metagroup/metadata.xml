		Meaningful Grouping of Studies in Meta-Analysis // Performs
		meaningful subgrouping in a meta-analysis. This is a two-step
		process; first, use the iterative grouping functions (e.g.,
		mgbin(), mgcont() ) to partition studies into statistically
		homogeneous clusters based on their effect size data. Second,
		use the meaning() function to analyze these new subgroups and
		understand their composition based on study-level
		characteristics (e.g., country, setting). This approach helps
		to uncover hidden structures in meta-analytic data and provide
		a deeper interpretation of heterogeneity.
