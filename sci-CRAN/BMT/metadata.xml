		The BMT Distribution // Density, distribution, quantile function,
		random number generation for the BMT (Bezier-Montenegro-Torres)
		distribution. Torres-Jimenez C.J. and Montenegro-Diaz A.M.
		(2017) doi:10.48550/arXiv.1709.05534. Moments, descriptive
		measures and parameter conversion for different
		parameterizations of the BMT distribution. Fit of the BMT
		distribution to non-censored data by maximum likelihood, moment
		matching, quantile matching, maximum goodness-of-fit, also
		known as minimum distance, maximum product of spacing, also
		called maximum spacing, and minimum quantile distance, which
		can also be called maximum quantile goodness-of-fit. Fit of
		univariate distributions for non-censored data using maximum
		product of spacing estimation and minimum quantile distance
		estimation is also included.
