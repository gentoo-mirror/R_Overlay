		Bayesian Accrual Prediction // Participant recruitment for
		medical research is challenging. Slow accrual leads to delays
		in research. Accrual monitoring during the process of
		recruitment is critical. Researchers need reliable tools to
		manage the accrual rate. We developed a Bayesian method that
		integrates the researcher's experience with previous trials and
		data from the current study, providing reliable predictions on
		accrual rate for clinical studies. For more details and
		background on these methodologies, see the publications of
		Byron, Stephen and Susan (2008) doi:10.1002/sim.3128, and Yu et
		al. (2015) doi:10.1002/sim.6359. In this R package, Bayesian
		accrual prediction functions are presented, which can be easily
		used by statisticians and clinical researchers.
