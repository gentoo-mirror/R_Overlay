		Genetics and Independence Testing of Mixed Genetic Panels //
		Developed to deal with multi-locus genotype data, this package
		is especially designed for those panel which include different
		type of markers. Basic genetic parameters like allele
		frequency, genotype frequency, heterozygosity and Hardy-
		Weinberg test of mixed genetic data can be obtained.     In
		addition, a new test for mutual independence which is
		compatible for mixed genetic data is developed in this package.
