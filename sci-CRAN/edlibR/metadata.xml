		R Integration for Edlib, the C/C++ Library for Exact Pairwise
		Sequence Alignment using Edit (Levenshtein) Distance //
		Bindings to edlib, a lightweight performant C/C++ library for
		exact pairwise sequence alignment using edit distance
		(Levenshtein distance). The algorithm computes the optimal
		alignment path, but also can be used to find only the start
		and/or end of the alignment path for convenience. Edlib was
		designed to be ultrafast and require little memory, with the
		capability to handle very large sequences. Three alignment
		methods are supported: global (Needleman-Wunsch), infix (Hybrid
		Wunsch), and prefix (Semi-Hybrid Wunsch). The original C/C++
		library is described in "Edlib: a C/C++ library for fast, exact
		sequence alignment using edit distance", M. oi, M. iki,
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw753.
