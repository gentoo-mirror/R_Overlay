		Obtaining Star Databases from Flat Tables // Data in
		multidimensional systems is obtained from operational systems
		and is transformed to adapt it to the new structure.
		Frequently, the operations to be performed aim to transform a
		flat table into a ROLAP (Relational On-Line Analytical
		Processing) star database. The main objective of the package is
		to allow the definition of these transformations easily. The
		implementation of the multidimensional database obtained can be
		exported to work with multidimensional analysis tools on
		spreadsheets or relational databases.
