		Dynamic Factor Models // Efficient estimation of Dynamic Factor
		Models using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm or
		Two-Step (2S) estimation, supporting datasets with missing
		data. Factors are assumed to follow a stationary VAR process of
		order p. The estimation options follow advances in the
		econometric literature: either running the Kalman Filter and
		Smoother once with initial values from PCA - 2S estimation as
		in Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2011)
		doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2011.02.012 - or via iterated Kalman
		Filtering and Smoothing until EM convergence - following Doz,
		Giannone and Reichlin (2012) doi:10.1162/REST_a_00225 - or
		using the adapted EM algorithm of Banbura and Modugno (2014)
		doi:10.1002/jae.2306, allowing arbitrary patterns of missing
		data. The implementation makes heavy use of the 'Armadillo'
		'C++' library and the 'collapse' package, providing for
		particularly speedy estimation. A comprehensive set of methods
		supports interpretation and visualization of the model as well
		as forecasting. Information criteria to choose the number of
		factors are also provided - following Bai and Ng (2002)
		doi:10.1111/1468-0262.00273.
