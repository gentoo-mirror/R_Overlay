		Classification Trees with Imprecise Probabilities // Creation of
		imprecise classification trees. They rely on probability
		estimation within each node by means of either the imprecise
		Dirichlet model or the nonparametric predictive inference
		approach. The splitting variable is selected by the strategy
		presented in Fink and Crossman (2013)
		http://www.sipta.org/isipta13/index.php?id=paperpaper=014.html,
		but also the original imprecise information gain of Abellan and
		Moral (2003) doi:10.1002/int.10143 is covered.
