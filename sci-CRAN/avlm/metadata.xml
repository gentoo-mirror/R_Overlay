		Safe Anytime Valid Inference for Linear Models // Anytime-valid
		inference for linear models, namely, sequential t-tests,
		sequential F-tests, and confidence sequences with time-uniform
		Type-I error and coverage guarantees. This allows hypotheses to
		be continuously tested without sacrificing false positive
		guarantees. It is based on the methods documented in Lindon et
		al. (2022) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2210.08589.
