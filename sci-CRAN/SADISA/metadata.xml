		Species Abundance Distributions with Independent-Species
		Assumption // Computes the probability of a set of species
		abundances of a single or multiple samples of individuals with
		one or more guilds under a mainland-island model. One must
		specify the mainland (metacommunity) model and the island
		(local) community model. It assumes that species fluctuate
		independently. The package also contains functions to simulate
		under this model. See Haegeman, B.  R.S. Etienne (2017). A
		general sampling formula for community structure data. Methods
		in Ecology  Evolution 8: 1506-1519 doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12807.
