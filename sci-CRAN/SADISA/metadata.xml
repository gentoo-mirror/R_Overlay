		Species Abundance Distributions with Independent-Species
		Assumption // Computes the probability of a set of species
		abundances of a single or multiple samples of individuals under
		a mainland-island model. One must specify the mainland
		(metacommunity) model and the island (local) community model.
		It assumes that species fluctuate independently. See Haegeman,
