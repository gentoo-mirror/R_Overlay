		Continuous Wavelet Transformation for Spectroscopy // Fast
		application of Continuous Wavelet Transformation ('CWT') on
		time series with special attention to spectroscopy. It is
		written using data.table and 'C++' language and in some
		functions it is possible to use parallel processing to speed-up
		the computation over samples. Currently, only the second
		derivative of a Gaussian wavelet function is implemented.
