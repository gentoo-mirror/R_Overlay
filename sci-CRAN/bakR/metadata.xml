		Analyze and Compare Nucleotide Recoding RNA Sequencing Datasets
		// Several implementations of a novel Bayesian hierarchical
		statistical model of nucleotide recoding RNA-seq experiments
		(NR-seq; TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.) for analyzing
		and comparing NR-seq datasets (see 'Vock and Simon' (2022)
		doi:10.1101/2022.09.02.505697). NR-seq is a powerful extension
		of RNA-seq that provides information about the kinetics of RNA
		metabolism (e.g., RNA degradation rate constants), which is
		notably lacking in standard RNA-seq data. The statistical model
		makes maximal use of these high-throughput datasets by sharing
		information across transcripts to significantly improve
		uncertainty quantification and increase statistical power.
		'bakR' includes a maximally efficient implementation of this
		model for conservative initial investigations of datasets.
		'bakR' also provides more highly powered implementations using
		the probabilistic programming language 'Stan' to sample from
		the full posterior distribution. 'bakR' performs multiple-test
		adjusted statistical inference with the output of these model
		implementations to help biologists separate signal from
		background. Methods to automatically visualize key results and
		detect batch effects are also provided.
