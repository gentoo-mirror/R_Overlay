		Agnostic Fay-Herriot Model for Small Area Statistics //
		Implements the Agnostic Fay-Herriot model, an extension of the
		traditional small area model. In place of normal sampling
		errors, the sampling error distribution is estimated with a
		Gaussian process to accommodate a broader class of
		distributions. This flexibility is most useful in the presence
		of bounded, multi-modal, or heavily skewed sampling errors.
