		Precision of Discrete Parameters in Transdimensional MCMC //
		Estimates the precision of transdimensional Markov chain Monte
		Carlo (MCMC) output, which is often used for Bayesian analysis
		of models with different dimensionality (e.g., model
		selection). Transdimensional MCMC (e.g., reversible jump MCMC)
		relies on sampling a discrete model-indicator variable to
		estimate the posterior model probabilities. If only few
		switches occur between the models, precision may be low and
		assessment based on the assumption of independent samples
		misleading. Based on the observed transition matrix of the
		indicator variable, the method of Heck, Overstall, Gronau,
		Wagenmakers (2019, Statistics  Computing, 29, 631-643)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9828-0 draws posterior samples of the
		stationary distribution to (a) assess the uncertainty in the
		estimated posterior model probabilities and (b) estimate the
		effective sample size of the MCMC output.
