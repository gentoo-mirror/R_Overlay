		Kernel Semi-Parametric Models // To fit the kernel semi-
		parametric model and its extensions. It allows multiple kernels
		and unlimited interactions in the same model. Coefficients are
		estimated by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood;
		penalization terms and hyperparameters are estimated by
		minimizing leave-one-out error. It includes predictions with
		confidence/prediction intervals, statistical tests for the
		significance of each kernel, a procedure for variable selection
		and graphical tools for diagnostics and interpretation of
		covariate effects. Currently it is implemented for continuous
		dependent variables. The package is based on the paper of Liu
		et al. (2007), doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00799.x.
