		Kernel Semi-Parametric Models // To fit the kernel semi-
		parametric model and its extensions. It allows multiple kernels
		and unlimited interactions in the same model. Coefficients are
		estimated by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood;
		penalization terms and hyperparameters are estimated by
		minimizing leave-one-out error. It includes predictions with
		confidence/prediction intervals, statistical tests for the
		significance of each kernel, a procedure for variable selection
		and graphical tools for diagnostics and interpretation of
		covariate effects. Currently it is implemented for continuous
		dependent variables.
