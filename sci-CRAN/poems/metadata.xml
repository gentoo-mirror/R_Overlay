		Pattern-Oriented Ensemble Modeling System // The poems package
		provides a framework of interoperable R6 classes (Chang, 2020,
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6) for building ensembles
		of viable models via the pattern-oriented modeling (POM)
		approach (Grimm et al., 2005, doi:10.1126/science.1116681). The
		package includes classes for encapsulating and generating model
		parameters, and managing the POM workflow. The workflow
		includes: model setup; generating model parameters via Latin
		hyper-cube sampling (Iman  Conover, 1980,
		doi:10.1080/03610928008827996); running multiple sampled model
		simulations; collating summary results; and validating and
		selecting an ensemble of models that best match known patterns.
		By default, model validation and selection utilizes an
		approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach (Beaumont et
		al., 2002, doi:10.1093/genetics/162.4.2025), although
		alternative user-defined functionality could be employed. The
		package includes a spatially explicit demographic population
		model simulation engine, which incorporates default
		functionality for density dependence, correlated environmental
		stochasticity, stage-based transitions, and distance-based
		dispersal. The user may customize the simulator by defining
		functionality for translocations, harvesting, mortality, and
		other processes, as well as defining the sequence order for the
		simulator processes. The framework could also be adapted for
		use with other model simulators by utilizing its extendable
		(inheritable) base classes.
