		Pattern-Oriented Ensemble Modeling System // The poems package
		provides a framework of interoperable R6 classes for building
		ensembles of viable models via the pattern-oriented modeling
		(POM) approach. The package includes classes for encapsulating
		and generating model parameters, and managing the POM workflow.
		The workflow includes: model setup; generating model parameters
		via Latin hyper-cube sampling; running multiple sampled model
		simulations; collating summary results; and validating and
		selecting an ensemble of models that best match known patterns.
		By default, model validation and selection utilizes an
		approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, although
		alternative user-defined functionality could be employed. The
		package includes a spatially explicit demographic population
		model simulation engine, which incorporates default
		functionality for density dependence, correlated environmental
		stochasticity, stage-based transitions, and distance-based
		dispersal. The user may customize the simulator by defining
		functionality for translocations, harvesting, mortality, and
		other processes, as well as defining the sequence order for the
		simulator processes. The framework could also be adapted for
		use with other model simulators by utilizing its extendable
		(inheritable) base classes.
