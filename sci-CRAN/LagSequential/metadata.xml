		Lag-Sequential Categorical Data Analysis // Lag-sequential
		analysis is a method of assessing of patterns (what tends to
		follow what?) in sequences of codes. The codes are typically
		for discrete behaviors or states. The functions in this package
		read a stream of codes, or a frequency transition matrix, and
		produce a variety of lag sequential statistics, including
		transitional frequencies, expected transitional frequencies,
		transitional probabilities, z values, adjusted residuals,
		Yule's Q values, likelihood ratio tests of stationarity across
		time and homogeneity across groups or segments, transformed
		kappas for unidirectional dependence, bidirectional dependence,
		parallel and nonparallel dominance, and significance levels
		based on both parametric and randomization tests. The methods
		are described in Bakeman  Quera (2011)
