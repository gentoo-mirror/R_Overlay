		Extends Messages, Warnings and Errors by Adding Levels and Log
		Files // Provides new functions info(), warn() and error(),
		similar to message(), warning() and stop() respectively.
		However, the new functions can have a 'level' associated with
		them, so that when executed the global level option determines
		whether they are shown or not. This allows debug modes,
		outputting more information. The can also output all messages
		to a log file.
