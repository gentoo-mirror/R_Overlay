		Geo-Statistical Modeling of Spatially Referenced Data // Provides
		functions for geo-statistical analysis of both continuous and
		count data using maximum likelihood methods. The models
		implemented in the package use stationary Gaussian processes
		with Matern correlation function to carry out spatial
		prediction in a geographical area of interest. The underpinning
		theory of the methods implemented in the package are found in
		Diggle and Giorgi (2019, ISBN: 978-1-138-06102-7).
