		Interactive Circular Visualization of Genomic Data using
		'htmlwidgets' and 'BioCircos.js' // Implement in 'R'
		interactive Circos-like visualizations of genomic data, to map
		information such as genetic variants, genomic fusions and
		aberrations to a circular genome, as proposed by the
		'JavaScript' library 'BioCircos.js', based on the 'JQuery' and
		'D3' technologies. The output is by default displayed in stand-
		alone HTML documents or in the 'RStudio' viewer pane. Moreover
		it can be integrated in 'R Markdown' documents and 'Shiny'
		applications.
