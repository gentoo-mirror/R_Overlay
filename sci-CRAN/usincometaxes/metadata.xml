		Calculate Federal and State Income Taxes in the United States //
		Calculates federal and state income taxes in the United States.
		It acts as a wrapper to the NBER's TAXSIM 35
		(http://taxsim.nber.org/taxsim35/) tax simulator. TAXSIM 35
		conducts the calculations, while 'usincometaxes' prepares the
		data for TAXSIM 35, sends the data to TAXSIM 35's server,
		retrieves the data, and places it into a data frame. All
		without the user worrying about this process.
