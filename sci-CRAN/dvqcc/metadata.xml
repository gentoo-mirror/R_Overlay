		Dynamic VAR - Based Control Charts for Batch Process Monitoring
		// A set of control charts for batch processes based on the VAR
		model. The package contains the implementation of T2.var and
		W.var control charts based on VAR model coefficients using the
		couple vectors theory. In each time-instant the VAR
		coefficients are estimated from a historical in-control dataset
		and a decision rule is made for online classifying of a new
		batch data. Those charts allow efficient online monitoring
		since the very first time-instant. The offline version is
		available too. In order to evaluate the chart's performance,
		this package contains functions to generate batch data for
		offline and online monitoring.See in Danilo Marcondes Filho and
		Marcio Valk (2020) doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2019.12.038.
