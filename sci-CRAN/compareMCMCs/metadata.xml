		Compare MCMC Efficiency from 'nimble' and/or Other MCMC Engines
		// Manages comparison of MCMC performance metrics from multiple
		MCMC algorithms. These may come from different MCMC
		configurations using the 'nimble' package or from other
		packages. Plug-ins for JAGS via 'rjags' and Stan via 'rstan'
		are provided. It is possible to write plug-ins for other
		packages. Performance metrics are held in an MCMCresult class
		along with samples and timing data. It is easy to apply new
		performance metrics. Reports are generated as html pages with
		figures comparing sets of runs. It is possible to configure the
		html pages, including providing new figure components.
