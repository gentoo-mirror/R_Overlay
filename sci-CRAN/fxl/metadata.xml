		'fxl' Single Case Design Charting Package // The 'fxl' Charting
		package is used to prepare and design single case design
		figures that are typically prepared in spreadsheet software.
		With 'fxl', there is no need to leave the R environment to
		prepare these works and many of the more unique conventions in
		single case experimental designs can be performed without the
		need for physically constructing features of plots (e.g.,
		drawing annotations across plots). Support is provided for
		various different plotting arrangements (e.g., multiple
		baseline), annotations (e.g., brackets, arrows), and output
		formats (e.g., svg, rasters).
