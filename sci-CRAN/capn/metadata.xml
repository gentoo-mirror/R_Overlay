		Capital Asset Pricing for Nature // Implements approximation
		methods for natural capital asset prices suggested by Fenichel
		and Abbott (2014) doi:10.1086/676034 in Journal of the
		Associations of Environmental and Resource Economists (JAERE),
		Fenichel et al. (2016) doi:10.1073/pnas.1513779113 in
		Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and Yun
		et al. (2017) in PNAS (accepted), and their extensions:
		creating Chebyshev polynomial nodes and grids, calculating
		basis of Chebyshev polynomials, approximation and their
		simulations for: V-approximation (single and multiple stocks,
		PNAS), P-approximation (single stock, PNAS), and Pdot-
		approximation (single stock, JAERE). Development of this
		package was generously supported by the Knobloch Family
		Foundation.
