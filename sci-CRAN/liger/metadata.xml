		Lightweight Iterative Geneset Enrichment // Gene Set Enrichment
		Analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that determines
		whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically
		significant, concordant differences between two biological
		states. The original algorithm is detailed in Subramanian et
		al. with 'Java' implementations available through the Broad
		Institute (Subramanian et al. 2005
		doi:10.1073/pnas.0506580102). The 'liger' package provides a
		lightweight R implementation of this enrichment test on a list
		of values (Fan et al., 2017 doi:10.5281/zenodo.887386). Given a
		list of values, such as p-values or log-fold changes derived
		from differential expression analysis or other analyses
		comparing biological states, this package enables you to test a
		priori defined set of genes for enrichment to enable
		interpretability of highly significant or high fold-change
		genes.
