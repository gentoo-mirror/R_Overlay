		Reverse Graphical Approaches // The graphical approach is
		proposed as a general framework for clinical trial designs
		involving multiple hypotheses, where decisions are made only
		based on the observed marginal p-values. A reverse graphical
		approach starts from a set of singleton graphs, and gradually
		add vertices into graphs until rejection of a set of hypotheses
		is made. See Gou, J. (2020). Reverse graphical approaches for
		multiple test procedures. Technical Report.
