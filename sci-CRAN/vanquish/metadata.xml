		Variant Quality Investigation Helper // Imports Variant Calling
		Format file into R. It can detect whether a sample contains
		contaminant from the same species. In the first stage of the
		approach, a change-point detection method is used to identify
		copy number variations for filtering. Next, features are
		extracted from the data for a support vector machine model. For
		log-likelihood calculation, the deviation parameter is
		estimated by maximum likelihood method. Using a radial basis
		function kernel support vector machine, the contamination of a
		sample can be detected.
