		Quantum Computing for Analyzing CD4 Lymphocytes and
		Antiretroviral Therapy // Resources, tutorials, and code
		snippets dedicated to exploring the intersection of quantum
		computing and artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of
		analyzing Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) lymphocytes and
		optimizing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV). With the emergence of quantum
		artificial intelligence and the development of small-scale
		quantum computers, there's an unprecedented opportunity to
		revolutionize the understanding of HIV dynamics and treatment
		strategies. This project leverages the R package 'qsimulatR'
		(Ostmeyer and Urbach, 2023,
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qsimulatR), a quantum
		computer simulator, to explore these applications in quantum
		computing techniques, addressing the challenges in studying CD4
		lymphocytes and enhancing ART efficacy.
