		Simplified Language for Plots and Charts // Provides a very
		simple syntax for the user to generate custom plot(s) without
		having to remember complicated 'ggplot2' syntax. The 'chartql'
		package uses 'ggplot2' and manages all the syntax complexities
		internally. As an example, to generate a bar chart of company
		sales faceted by product category further faceted by season of
		the year, we simply write: "CHART bar X category, season Y
		sales".
