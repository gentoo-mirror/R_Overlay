		Magnetic Resonance Binning, Integration and Normalization //
		Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is widely used in Life Science
		research. The package (doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00684)
		converts 1D or 2D data into a matrix of values suitable for
		further data analysis and performs basic processing steps in a
		reproducible way. Negative values, a common issue in such data,
		are replaced by positive values. All used parameters are stored
		in a readable text file and can be restored from that file to
		enable exact reproduction of the data at a later time.
