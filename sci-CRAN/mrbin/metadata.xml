		Magnetic Resonance Binning, Integration and Normalization //
		Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is widely used for metabolite
		analysis. This package is a collection for processing and
		analyzing metabolite data. (doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00684).
		The namesake function converts 1D or 2D data into a matrix of
		values suitable for further data analysis and performs basic
		processing steps in a reproducible way. Negative values, a
		common issue in such data, are replaced by positive values. All
		used parameters are stored in a readable text file and can be
		restored from that file to enable exact reproduction of the
		data at a later time.
