		Metabolomics Data Analysis Functions // A collection of functions
		for processing and analyzing metabolite data. The namesake
		function "mrbin" converts 1D or 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
		data into a matrix of values suitable for further data analysis
		and performs basic processing steps in a reproducible way.
		Negative values, a common issue in such data, are replaced by
		positive values (doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00684). All used
		parameters are stored in a readable text file and can be
		restored from that file to enable exact reproduction of the
		data at a later time. The function "fia" ranks features
		according to their impact on classifier models, especially
		artificial neural network models.
