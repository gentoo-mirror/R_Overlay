		Explicitly Qualifying Namespaces by Automatically Adding 'pkg::'
		to Functions // Automatically adding 'pkg::' to a function,
		i.e. mutate() becomes dplyr::mutate(). It is up to the user to
		determine which packages should be used explicitly, whether to
		include base R packages or use the functionality on selected
		text, a file, or a complete directory. User friendly logging is
		provided in the 'RStudio' Markers pane. Lives in the spirit of
		'lintr' and 'styler'.
