		InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data 'CHIRPS'. The 'CHIRPS'
		data is a 35+ year quasi-global rainfall data set, which
		incorporates 0.05 arc-degrees resolution satellite imagery, and
		in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for
		trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. For more
		details on 'CHIRPS' data please visit its official home page
		https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps. Requests from large time
		series ( 10 years) and large geographic coverage (global scale)
		may take several minutes.
