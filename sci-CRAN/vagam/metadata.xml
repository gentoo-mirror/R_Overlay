		Variational Approximations for Generalized Additive Models //
		Fits generalized additive models (GAMs) using a variational
		approximations (VA) framework. In brief, the VA framework
		provides a fully or at least closed to fully tractable lower
		bound approximation to the marginal likelihood of a GAM when it
		is parameterized as a mixed model (using penalized splines,
		say). In doing so, the VA framework aims offers both the
		stability and natural inference tools available in the mixed
		model approach to GAMs, while achieving computation times
		comparable to that of using the penalized likelihood approach
		to GAMs. See Hui et al. (2018)
