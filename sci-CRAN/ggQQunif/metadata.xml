		Compare Big Datasets to the Uniform Distribution // A quantile-
		quantile plot can be used to compare a sample of p-values to
		the uniform distribution.  But when the dataset is big (i.e.
		1e4 p-values), plotting the quantile-quantile plot can be slow.
		geom_QQ uses all the data to calculate the quantiles, but thins
		it out in a way that focuses on points near zero before
		plotting to speed up plotting and decrease file size, when
		vector graphics are stored.
