		A Tool for 'Covariate'-Sensitive Longitudinal Analysis on 'omics'
		Data // This tool takes longitudinal dataset as input and
		analyzes if there is significant change of the features over
		time (a proxy for treatments), while detects and controls for
		'covariates' simultaneously. 'LongDat' is able to take in
		several data types as input, including count, proportion,
		binary, ordinal and continuous data. The output table contains
		p values, effect sizes and 'covariates' of each feature, making
		the downstream analysis easy.
