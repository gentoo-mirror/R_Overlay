		Utility Functions for Working with Random Number Generators //
		Provides a set of functions for working with Random Number
		Generators (RNGs). In particular, a generic S4 framework is
		defined for getting/setting the current RNG, or RNG data that
		are embedded into objects for reproducibility. Notably,
		convenient default methods greatly facilitate the way current
		RNG settings can be changed.
