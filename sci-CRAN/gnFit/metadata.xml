		Goodness of Fit Test for Continuous Distribution Functions //
		Computes the test statistic and p-value of the Cramer-von Mises
		and Anderson-Darling test for some continuous distribution
		functions proposed by Chen and Balakrishnan (1995)
		http://asq.org/qic/display-item/index.html?item=11407. In
		addition to our classic distribution functions here, we
		calculate the Goodness of Fit (GoF) test to dataset which
		follows the extreme value distribution function, without
		remembering the formula of distribution/density functions.
