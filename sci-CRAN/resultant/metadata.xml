		Utilities for Multivariate Polynomials with Rational Coefficients
		// Computation of resultant, subresultants, greatest common
		divisor, integral division (aka division without remainder) of
		two multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients, Sturm-
		Habicht sequence and square-free factorization of a
		multivariate polynomial with rational coefficients. The
		computations are performed by the 'C++' library 'CGAL'
		(https://www.cgal.org/). Resultants have applications in
		polynomial systems solving, number theory, and algebraic
		geometry. The package also contains some functions computing
		the number of real roots of a univariate polynomial with
		rational coefficients, and a function computing the division
		with remainder of two univariate polynomials with rational
		coefficients.
