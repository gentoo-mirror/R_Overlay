		Performance Spectrum Miner for Event Data // Compute detailed and
		aggregated performance spectrum for event data. The detailed
		performance spectrum describes the event data in terms of
		segments, where the performance of each segment is measured and
		plotted for any occurrences of this segment over time and can
		be classified, e.g., regarding the overall population. The
		aggregated performance spectrum visualises the amount of cases
		of particular performance over time. Denisov, V., Fahland, D.,
