		Event Stream Abstraction using Interval Logic // This is the R
		API for the 'nfer' formalism (http://nfer.io/). 'nfer' was
		developed to specify event stream abstractions for spacecraft
		telemetry such as the Mars Science Laboratory.  Users write
		rules using a syntax that borrows heavily from Allen's Temporal
		Logic that, when applied to an event stream, construct a
		hierarchy of temporal intervals with data.  The R API supports
		loading rules from a file or mining them from historical data.
		Traces of events or pools of intervals are provided as data
		frames.
