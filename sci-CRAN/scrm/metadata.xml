		Simulating the Evolution of Biological Sequences // A coalescent
		simulator that allows the rapid simulation of biological
		sequences under neutral models of evolution, see Staab et al.
		(2015) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu861. Different to other
		coalescent based simulations, it has an optional approximation
		parameter that allows for high accuracy while maintaining a
		linear run time cost for long sequences. It is optimized for
		simulating massive data sets as produced by Next- Generation
		Sequencing technologies for up to several thousand sequences.
