		Solvers for Maximum Weight Connected Subgraph Problem and Its
		Variants // Algorithms for solving various Maximum Weight
		Connected Subgraph Problems, including variants with budget
		constraints, cardinality constraints, weighted edges and
		signals. The package represents an R interface to high-
		efficient solvers based on relax-and-cut approach (lvarez-
		Miranda E., Sinnl M. (2017) doi:10.1016/j.cor.2017.05.015)
		mixed-integer programming (Loboda A., Artyomov M., and
		Sergushichev A. (2016) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-43681-4_17) and
		simulated annealing.
