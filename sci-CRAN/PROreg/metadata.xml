		Patient Reported Outcomes Regression Analysis // It offers a wide
		variety of techniques, such as graphics, recoding, or
		regression models, for a comprehensive analysis of patient-
		reported outcomes (PRO). Especially novel is the broad range of
		regression models based on the beta-binomial distribution
		useful for analyzing binomial data with over-dispersion in
		cross-sectional, longitudinal, or multidimensional response
		studies (see Najera-Zuloaga J., Lee D.-J. and Arostegui I.
		(2019) doi:10.1002/bimj.201700251).
