		Utilities for Sampling // Interactive tools for generating random
		samples. Users select an .xlsx or .csv file with population
		data and are walked through selecting the sample type (Simple
		Random Sample or Stratified), the number of backups desired,
		and a "stratify_on" value (if desired). An .xlsx file is
		created with the sample and key metadata for reference. It is
		menu-driven and lets users pick an output directory. See
		vignettes for a detailed walk-through.
