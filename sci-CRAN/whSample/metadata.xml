		Utilities for Sampling // Interactive tools for generating random
		samples. Users select an .xlsx or .csv file with population
		data and are walked through selecting the sample type (Simple
		Random Sample or Stratified), the number of backups desired,
		and a "stratify_on" value (if desired). The sample size is
		determined using a normal approximation to the hypergeometric
		distribution based on Nicholson (1956)
		doi:10.1214/aoms/1177728270. An .xlsx file is created with the
		sample and key metadata for reference. It is menu-driven and
		lets users pick an output directory. See vignettes for a
		detailed walk-through.
