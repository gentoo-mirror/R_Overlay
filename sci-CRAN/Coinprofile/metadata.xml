		Coincident Profile // Builds the coincident profile proposed by
		Martinez, W and Nieto, Fabio H and Poncela, P (2016)
		doi:10.1016/j.spl.2015.11.008. This methodology studies the
		relationship between a couple of time series based on the the
		set of turning points of each time series. The coincident
		profile establishes if two time series are coincident, or one
		of them leads the second.
