		Parsimonious Families of Hidden Markov Models for Matrix-Variate
		Longitudinal Data // Implements three families of parsimonious
		hidden Markov models (HMMs) for matrix-variate longitudinal
		data using the Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM)
		algorithm. The package supports matrix-variate normal, t, and
		contaminated normal distributions as emission distributions.
		For each hidden state, parsimony is achieved through the eigen-
		decomposition of the covariance matrices associated with the
		emission distribution. This approach results in a comprehensive
		set of 98 parsimonious HMMs for each type of emission
		distribution. Atypical matrix detection is also supported,
		utilizing the fitted (heavy-tailed) models.
