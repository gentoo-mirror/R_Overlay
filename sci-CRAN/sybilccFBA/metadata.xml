		Cost Constrained Flux Balance Analysis (ccFBA): MetabOlic
		Modeling with ENzyme kineTics (MOMENT) // Different techniques
		of cost constrained flux balance analysis. 1- MetabOlic
		Modeling with ENzyme kineTics 'MOMENT' which uses enzyme
		kinetic data and enzyme molecular weights to constrain flux
		balance analysis(FBA) and it is described in Adadi, R.,
		Volkmer, B., Milo, R., Heinemann, M.,  Shlomi, T. (2012).
		Prediction of Microbial Growth Rate versus Biomass Yield by a
		Metabolic Network with Kinetic Parameters, 8(7).
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002575. 2- an improvement of 'MOMENT'
		that considers multi-functional enzymes 'ccFBA'. Described in
		Desouki, Abdelmoneim. Algorithms for improving the predictive
		power of flux balance analysis. PhD dissertation, 2016. FBA is
		a mathematical technique to find fluxes in metabolic models at
		steady state. It is described in Orth, J.D., Thiele, I. and
		Palsson, B.O.  What is flux balance analysis? Nat. Biotech. 28,
		245-248(2010).
