		Network Meta-Analysis Based on Multivariate Meta-Analysis Models
		// Network meta-analysis tools based on contrast-based approach
		using the multivariate meta-analysis and meta-regression models
		(Noma et al. (2023) Forthcoming). Standard analysis tools for
		network meta-analysis and meta-regression (e.g., synthesis
		analysis, ranking analysis, and creating league table) are
		available by simple commands. For inconsistency analyses, the
		local and global inconsistency tests based on the Higgins'
		design-by-treatment interaction model and the side-splitting
		can be applied. Also, standard graphical tools for network
		meta-analysis (e.g., network plot, ranked forest plot, and
		transitivity analysis) are available. For the synthesis
		analyses, the Noma-Hamura's improved REML (restricted maximum
		likelihood)-based methods (Noma et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1002/jrsm.1652 doi:10.1002/jrsm.1651) are adopted as the
		default methods.
