		Network Meta-Analysis Based on Multivariate Meta-Analysis and
		Meta-Regression Models // Network meta-analysis tools based on
		contrast-based approach using the multivariate meta-analysis
		and meta-regression models (Noma et al. (2025)
		doi:10.1101/2025.09.15.25335823). Comprehensive analysis tools
		for network meta-analysis and meta-regression (e.g., synthesis
		analysis, ranking analysis, and creating league table) are
		available through simple commands. For inconsistency
		assessment, the local and global inconsistency tests based on
		the Higgins' design-by-treatment interaction model are
		available. In addition, the side-splitting methods and
		Jackson's random inconsistency model can be applied. Standard
		graphical tools for network meta-analysis, including network
		plots, ranked forest plots, and transitivity analyses, are also
		provided. For the synthesis analyses, the Noma-Hamura's
		improved REML (restricted maximum likelihood)-based methods
		(Noma et al. (2023) doi:10.1002/jrsm.1652
		doi:10.1002/jrsm.1651) are adopted as the default methods.
