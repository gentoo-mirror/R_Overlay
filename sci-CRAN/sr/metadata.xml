		Smooth Regression - The Gamma Test and Tools // Finds causal
		connections in precision data, finds lags and embeddings in
		time series, guides training of neural networks and other
		smooth models, evaluates their performance, gives a
		mathematically grounded answer to the over-training problem.
		Smooth regression is based on the Gamma test, which measures
		smoothness in a multivariate relationship.  Causal relations
		are smooth, noise is not. 'sr' includes the Gamma test and
		search techniques that use it. References: Evans  Jones (2002)
