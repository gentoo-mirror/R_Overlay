		Regression, Inference, and General Data Analysis Tools in R // A
		set of tools to streamline data analysis. Learning both R and
		introductory statistics at the same time can be challenging,
		and so we created 'rigr' to facilitate common data analysis
		tasks and enable learners to focus on statistical concepts. We
		provide easy-to-use interfaces for descriptive statistics, one-
		and two-sample inference, and regression analyses. 'rigr'
		output includes key information while omitting unnecessary
		details that can be confusing to beginners. Heteroscedasticity-
		robust ("sandwich") standard errors are returned by default,
		and multiple partial F-tests and tests for contrasts are easy
		to specify. A single regression function can fit both linear
		and generalized linear models, allowing students to more easily
		make connections between different classes of models.
