		Isotope Clustering and Assignment Tools // This resource provides
		tools to create, compare, and post-process spatial isotope
		assignment models of animal origin. It generates probability-
		of-origin maps for individuals based on user-provided tissue
		and environment isotope values (e.g., as generated by IsoMAP,
		Bowen [2010] doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12147) using the framework
		established in Bowen (2014) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12147. The
		package 'isocat' can then quantitatively compare and cluster
		these maps to group individuals by similar origin. It also
		includes techniques for applying four approaches (cumulative
		sum, odds ratio, quantile only, and quantile simulation) with
		which users can summarize geographic origins and probable
		distance traveled by individuals.
