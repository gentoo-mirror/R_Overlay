		Isotope Origin Clustering and Assignment Tools // This resource
		provides tools to create, compare, and post-process spatial
		isotope assignment models of animal origin. It generates
		probability-of-origin maps for individuals based on user-
		provided tissue and environment isotope values (e.g., as
		generated by IsoMAP, Bowen et al. [2013]
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12147) using the framework established in
		Bowen et al. (2010) doi:10.1146/annurev-earth-040809-152429).
		The package 'isocat' can then quantitatively compare and
		cluster these maps to group individuals by similar origin. It
		also includes techniques for applying four approaches
		(cumulative sum, odds ratio, quantile only, and quantile
		simulation) with which users can summarize geographic origins
		and probable distance traveled by individuals. Campbell et al.
		[2020] establishes several of the functions included in this
		package doi:10.1515/ami-2020-0004.
