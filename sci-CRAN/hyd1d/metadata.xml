		1d Water Level Interpolation along the Rivers Elbe and Rhine //
		An S4 class and several functions which utilize internally
		stored datasets and gauging data enable 1d water level
		interpolation. The S4 class (WaterLevelDataFrame) structures
		the computation and visualisation of 1d water level information
		along the German federal waterways Elbe and Rhine. 'hyd1d'
		delivers 1d water level data - extracted from the 'FLYS'
		database - and validated gauging data - extracted from the
		hydrological database 'HyDaBa' - package-internally. For
		computations near real time gauging data are queried externally
		from the 'PEGELONLINE REST API'
		https://pegelonline.wsv.de/webservice/dokuRestapi.
