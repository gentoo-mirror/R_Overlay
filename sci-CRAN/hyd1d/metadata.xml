		Algorithms to Compute 1d Water Levels along the German Federal
		Waterways Elbe and Rhine // An S4 class and several functions
		which utilize internally stored datasets and gauging data
		enable 1d water level interpolation. The S4 class
		(WaterLevelDataFrame) structures the computation and
		visualisation of 1d water level information along the German
		federal waterways Elbe and Rhine. 'hyd1d' delivers 1d water
		level data - extracted from the 'FLYS' database - and validated
		gauging data - extracted from the hydrological database
		'HyDaBa' - package-internally. For computations near real time
		gauging data are queried externally from the 'PEGELONLINE REST
		API' https://pegelonline.wsv.de/webservice/dokuRestapi.
