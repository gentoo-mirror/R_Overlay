		Wavelet Based K-Nearest Neighbor Model // The employment of the
		Wavelet decomposition technique proves to be highly
		advantageous in the modelling of noisy time series data.
		Wavelet decomposition technique using the "haar" algorithm has
		been incorporated to formulate a hybrid Wavelet KNN (K-Nearest
		Neighbour) model for time series forecasting, as proposed by
		Anjoy and Paul (2017) DOI:10.1007/s00521-017-3289-9.
