		Joint Longitudinal and Survival Model for Big Data // Provides
		analysis tools for big data where the sample size is very
		large. It offers a suite of functions for fitting and
		predicting joint models, which allow for the simultaneous
		analysis of longitudinal and time-to-event data. This
		statistical methodology is particularly useful in medical
		research where there is often interest in understanding the
		relationship between a longitudinal biomarker and a clinical
		outcome, such as survival or disease progression. This can be
		particularly useful in a clinical setting where it is important
		to be able to predict how a patient's health status may change
		over time. Overall, this package provides a comprehensive set
		of tools for joint modeling of BIG data obtained as survival
		and longitudinal outcomes with both Bayesian and non-Bayesian
		approaches. Its versatility and flexibility make it a valuable
		resource for researchers in many different fields, particularly
		in the medical and health sciences.
