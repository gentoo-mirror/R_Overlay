		Fast Kriging and Geostatistics on Grids with Kronecker Covariance
		// Geostatistical modeling and kriging with gridded data using
		spatially separable covariance functions (Kronecker
		covariances). Kronecker products in these models provide
		shortcuts for solving large matrix problems in likelihood and
		conditional mean, making 'snapKrig' computationally efficient
		with large grids. The package supplies its own S3 grid object
		class, and a host of methods including plot, print, Ops, square
		bracket replace/assign, and more. Our computational methods are
		described in Koch, Lele, Lewis (2020) doi:10.7939/r3-g6qb-bq70.
