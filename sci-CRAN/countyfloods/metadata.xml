		Quantify United States County-Level Flood Measurements //
		Quantifies United States flood impacts at the county level
		using United States Geological Service (USGS) River Discharge
		data for the USGS API. This package builds on R packages from
		the USGS, with the goal of creating county-level time series of
		flood status that can be more easily joined with county-level
		impact measurements, including health outcomes. This work was
		supported in part by grants from the National Institute of
		Environmental Health Sciences (R00ES022631), the Colorado Water
		Center, and the National Science Foundation, Integrative
		Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) Grant No.
		DGE-0966346 "I-WATER: Integrated Water, Atmosphere, Ecosystems
		Education and Research Program" at Colorado State University.
