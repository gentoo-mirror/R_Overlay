		Easy Access to NetCDF Files with CF Metadata Conventions //
		Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) files are widely used for
		scientific data. Library-level access in R is provided through
		packages 'RNetCDF' and 'ncdf4'. Package 'ncdfCF' is built on
		top of 'RNetCDF' and makes the data and its attributes
		available as a set of S4 classes that are informed by the
		Climate and Forecasting Metadata Conventions. Access to the
		data uses standard R subsetting operators and common function
		forms.
