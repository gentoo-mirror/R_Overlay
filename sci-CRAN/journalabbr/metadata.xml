		Journal Abbreviations for BibTeX Documents // Since the reference
		management software (such as 'Zotero', 'Mendeley') exports Bib
		file journal abbreviation is not detailed enough, the
		'journalabbr' package only abbreviates the journal field of Bib
		file, and then outputs a new Bib file for generating reference
		format with journal abbreviation on other software (such as
		'texstudio'). The abbreviation table is from 'JabRef'. At the
		same time, 'Shiny' application is provided to generate
		'thebibliography', a reference format that can be directly used
		for latex paper writing based on 'Rmd' files.
