		Bayesian Multivariate Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Regression Model for
		Correlated Count Data // Fits a Bayesian Regression Model for
		multivariate count data. This model assumes that the data is
		distributed according to the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson
		distribution, and for each response variable it is associate
		different covariates. This model allows to account for
		correlations between the counts by using latent effects based
		on the Chib and Winkelmann (2001)
		http://www.jstor.org/stable/1392277 proposal.
