		County-Level Estimates of Fertilizer Application in USA //
		Compiled and cleaned the county-level estimates of fertilizer,
		nitrogen and phosphorus, from 1945 to 2012 in United States of
		America (USA).  The commercial fertilizer data were originally
		generated by USGS based on the sales data of commercial
		fertilizer. The manure data were estimated based on county-
		level population data of livestock, poultry, and other animals.
		See the user manual for detailed data sources and cleaning
		methods. 'usfertilizer' utilized the tidyverse to clean the
		original data and provide user-friendly dataframe. Please note
		that USGS does not endorse this package. Also data from 1986 is
		not available for now.
