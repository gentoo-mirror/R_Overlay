		County-Level Estimates of Fertilizer Application in US //
		Compiled and cleaned the county-level estimates of fertilizer,
		nitrogen and phosphorus, from 1945 to 2012.  The dataset were
		originally generated by USGS based on the sales data of
		commercial fertilizer. See https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/
		item/5851b2d1e4b0f99207c4f238/ for details. 'usfertilizer'
		utilized the tidyverse to clean the original data and provide
		user-friendly dataframe. Please note that USGS does not endorse
		this package and this package does not include manure data.
		Also data from 1986 is not available for now.
