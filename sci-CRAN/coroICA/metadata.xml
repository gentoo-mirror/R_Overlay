		Confounding Robust Independent Component Analysis for Noisy and
		Grouped Data // Contains an implementation of a confounding
		robust independent component analysis (ICA) for noisy and
		grouped data. The main function coroICA() performs a blind
		source separation, by maximizing an independence across sources
		and allows to adjust for varying confounding based on user-
		specified groups. Additionally, the package contains the
		function uwedge() which can be used to approximately jointly
		diagonalize a list of matrices. For more details see the
		project website https://sweichwald.de/coroICA/.
