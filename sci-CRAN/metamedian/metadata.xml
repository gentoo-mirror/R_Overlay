		Meta-Analysis of Medians // Implements several methods to meta-
		analyze studies that report the sample median of the outcome.
		When the primary studies are one-group studies, the methods of
		McGrath et al. (2019) doi:10.1002/sim.8013 can be applied to
		estimate the pooled median. In the two-group context, the
		methods of McGrath et al. (2020) doi:10.1002/bimj.201900036 can
		be applied to estimate the pooled raw difference of medians
		across groups.
