		Computation of Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) // Computing
		package for Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) using Alkire-
		Foster method. Given N individuals, each person has D
		indicators of deprivation, the package compute MPI value to
		represent the degree of poverty in a population. The inputs are
		1) an N by D matrix, which has the element (i,j) represents
		whether an individual i is deprived in an indicator j (1 is
		deprived and 0 is not deprived), and 2) the deprivation
		threshold.  The main output is the MPI value, which has the
		range between zero and one. MPI value is approaching one if
		almost all people are deprived in all indicators, and it is
		approaching zero if almost no people are deprived in any
		indicator.  Please see Alkire S., Chatterjee, M., Conconi, A.,
		Seth, S. and Ana Vaz (2014)
