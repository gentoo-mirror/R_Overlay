		Generation of Full Rank Design Matrix // Creates a full rank
		matrix out of a given matrix. The intended use is for one-hot
		encoded design matrices that should be used in linear models to
		ensure that significant associations can be correctly
		interpreted. However, 'fullRankMatrix' can be applied to any
		matrix to make it full rank. It removes columns with only 0's,
		merges duplicated columns and discovers linearly dependent
		columns and replaces them with linearly independent columns
		that span the space of the original columns. Columns are
		renamed to reflect those modifications. This results in a full
		rank matrix that can be used as a design matrix in linear
		models. The algorithm and some functions are inspired by Kuhn,
