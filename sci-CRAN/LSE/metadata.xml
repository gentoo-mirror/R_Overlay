		Constrained Least Squares and Generalized QR Factorization // The
		solution of equality constrained least squares problem (LSE) is
		given through four analytics methods (Generalized QR
		Factorization, Lagrange Multipliers, Direct Elimination and
		Null Space method). We expose the orthogonal decomposition
		called Generalized QR Factorization (GQR) and also RQ
		factorization. Finally some codes for the solution of LSE
		applied in quaternions.
