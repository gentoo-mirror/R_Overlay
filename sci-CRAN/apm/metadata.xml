		Averaged Prediction Models // In panel data settings, specifies
		set of candidate models, fits them to data from pre-treatment
		validation periods, and selects model as average over candidate
		models, weighting each by posterior probability of being most
		robust given its differential average prediction errors in pre-
		treatment validation periods. Subsequent estimation and
		inference of causal effect's bounds accounts for both model and
		sampling uncertainty, and calculates the robustness changepoint
		value at which bounds go from excluding to including 0. The
		package also includes a range of diagnostic plots, such as
		those illustrating models' differential average prediction
		errors and the posterior distribution of which model is most
		robust.
