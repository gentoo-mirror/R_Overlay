		Makes 'R' Easier for Everyone // A meta-package that aims to make
		'R' easier for everyone, especially programmers who have a
		background in 'SAS' software. This set of packages brings many
		useful concepts to 'R', including data libraries, data
		dictionaries, formats and format catalogs, a data step, and a
		traceable log.  The system also includes a package that
		replicates several commonly-used 'SAS' procedures, like 'PROC
		FREQ', 'PROC MEANS', and 'PROC REG'.
