		Makes 'R' Easier for Everyone // A meta-package that aims to make
		'R' easier for everyone, especially programmers who have a
		background in 'SAS' software. This set of packages brings many
		useful concepts to 'R', including data libraries, data
		dictionaries, formats and format catalogs, a data step, and a
		traceable log.  The 'flagship' package is a reporting package
		that can output in text, rich text, 'PDF', 'HTML', and 'DOCX'
		file formats.
