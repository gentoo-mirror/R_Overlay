		Calculate physiologic characteristics of awake and anesthetized
		adults, children and infants // A variety of formulae are
		provided for estimation of physiologic characteristics of
		infants, children, and adults. Calculations include: body
		surface area, ideal weight, airway dead-space, the alveolar gas
		equation, and GFR.  Each formula is referenced to the original
		publication. Future functions will cover more material with a
		focus on anaesthesia, critical care and peri-operative
