		Test Theory Analysis and Biclustering // Implements comprehensive
		test data engineering methods as described in Shojima (2022,
		ISBN:978-9811699856). Provides statistical techniques for
		engineering and processing test data: Classical Test Theory
		(CTT) with reliability coefficients for continuous ability
		assessment; Item Response Theory (IRT) including Rasch, 2PL,
		and 3PL models with item/test information functions; Latent
		Class Analysis (LCA) for nominal clustering; Latent Rank
		Analysis (LRA) for ordinal clustering with automatic
		determination of cluster numbers; Biclustering methods
		including infinite relational models for simultaneous
		clustering of examinees and items without predefined cluster
		numbers; and Bayesian Network Models (BNM) for visualizing
		inter-item dependencies. Features local dependence analysis
		through LRA and biclustering, parameter estimation,
		dimensionality assessment, and network structure visualization
		for educational, psychological, and social science research.
