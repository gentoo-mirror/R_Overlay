		Fast 3D Lacunarity for Voxel Data // Calculates 3D lacunarity
		from voxel data. It is designed for use with point clouds
		generated from Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) scans in
		order to measure the spatial heterogeneity of 3-dimensional
		structures such as forest stands. It provides fast 'C++'
		functions to efficiently bin point cloud data into voxels and
		calculate lacunarity using different variants of the gliding-
		box algorithm originated by Allain  Cloitre (1991)
