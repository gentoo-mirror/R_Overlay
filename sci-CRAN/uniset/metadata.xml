		Dynamic Settings File // Any package (subsequently called 'target
		package') is enabled to provide its users an easily accessible,
		user-friendly and human readable text file where key=value
		pairs (used by functions defined in the target package) can be
		saved. This settings file lives in a location defined by the
		user of the target package, and its user-defined values remain
		unchanged even when the author of the target package is
		introducing or deleting keys, or when the target package is
		updated or re-installed.
