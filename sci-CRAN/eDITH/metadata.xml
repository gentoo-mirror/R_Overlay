		Model Transport of Environmental DNA in River Networks // Runs
		the eDITH (environmental DNA Integrating Transport and
		Hydrology) model, which implements a mass balance of
		environmental DNA (eDNA) transport at a river network scale
		coupled with a species distribution model to obtain maps of
		species distribution. eDITH can work with both eDNA
		concentration (e.g., obtained via quantitative polymerase chain
		reaction) or metabarcoding (read count) data. Parameter
		estimation can be performed via Bayesian techniques (via the
		'BayesianTools' package) or optimization algorithms. An
		interface to the 'DHARMa' package for posterior predictive
		checks is provided. See Carraro et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.1813843115 and Carraro et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17337-8 for methodological details.
