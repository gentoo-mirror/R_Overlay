		Semiparametric Elicitation // Implements a method for fitting a
		bounded probability distribution to quantiles (for example
		stated by an expert), see Bornkamp and Ickstadt (2009) for
		details.  For this purpose B-splines are used, and the density
		is obtained by penalized least squares based on a Brier entropy
		penalty.  The package provides methods for fitting the
		distribution as well as methods for evaluating the underlying
		density and cdf. In addition methods for plotting the
		distribution, drawing random numbers and calculating quantiles
		of the obtained distribution are provided.
