		Unmatched Monotone Regression // Unmatched regression refers to
		the regression setting where covariates and predictors are
		collected separately/independently and so are not paired
		together, as in the usual regression setting.   Balabdaoui,
		Doss, and Durot (2021) arXiv:2007.00830    study the unmatched
		regression setting where the univariate regression function is
		known to    be monotone.     This package implements methods
		for computing  the estimator developed in  Balabdaoui, Doss,
		and Durot (2021).  The main method is an active-set-trust-
		region-based method.
