		Testing for Partial Copulas and the Simplifying Assumption in
		Vine Copulas // Routines for two different test types, the
		Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) test and the Vectorial
		Independence (VI) test are provided (Kurz and Spanhel (2017)
		arXiv:1706.02338). The tests can be applied to check whether a
		conditional copula coincides with its partial copula. Functions
		to test whether a regular vine copula satisfies the so-called
		simplifying assumption or to test a single copula within a
		regular vine copula to be a (j-1)-th order partial copula are
		available. The CCC test comes with a decision tree approach to
		allow testing in high-dimensional settings.
