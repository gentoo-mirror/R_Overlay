		Testing for Partial Copulas and the Simplifying Assumption in
		Vine Copulas // Routines for two different test types, the
		Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) test and the Vectorial
		Independence (VI) test are provided (Kurz and Spanhel (2022)
		doi:10.1214/22-EJS2051). The tests can be applied to check
		whether a conditional copula coincides with its partial copula.
		Functions to test whether a regular vine copula satisfies the
		so-called simplifying assumption or to test a single copula
		within a regular vine copula to be a (j-1)-th order partial
		copula are available. The CCC test comes with a decision tree
		approach to allow testing in high-dimensional settings.
