		Fast and Easy Data Cleaning // A wrapper around the new 'cleaner'
		package, that allows data cleaning functions for classes
		'logical', 'factor', 'numeric', 'character', 'currency' and
		'Date' to make data cleaning fast and easy. Relying on very few
		dependencies, it provides smart guessing, but with user options
		to override anything if needed.
