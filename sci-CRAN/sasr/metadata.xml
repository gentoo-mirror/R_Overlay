		'SAS' Interface // Provides a 'SAS' interface, through
		'SASPy'(https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/) and
		'reticulate'(https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/).  This
		package helps you create 'SAS' sessions, execute 'SAS' code in
		remote 'SAS' servers, retrieve execution results and log, and
		exchange datasets between 'SAS' and 'R'.  It also helps you to
		install 'SASPy' and create a configuration file for the
		connection. Please review the 'SASPy' license file as
		instructed so that you comply with its separate and independent
		license.
