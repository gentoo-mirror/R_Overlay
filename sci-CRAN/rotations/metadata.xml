		Working with Rotation Data // Tools for working with rotational
		data, including simulation from the most commonly used
		distributions on SO(3), methods for different Bayes, mean and
		median type estimators for the central orientation of a sample,
		confidence/credible regions for the central orientation based
		on those estimators and a novel visualization technique for
		rotation data.  Most recently, functions to identify
		potentially discordant (outlying) values have been added.
