		Functions for Analyzing Performance Science Data // Contains
		functions to compute statistics relevant to performance
		scientists, coaches, and athletes. The functions within the
		package that report group-wide statistics have to do with
		measurement instrument reliability and individual change of
		athletes. Many of them come from the work of Hopkins (2000)
		doi:10.2165/00007256-200030010-00001. There are also functions
		that apply a particular statistical concept to each measurement
		in the data.
