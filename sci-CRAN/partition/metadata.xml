		Agglomerative Partitioning Framework for Dimension Reduction // A
		fast and flexible framework for agglomerative partitioning.
		'partition' uses an approach called Direct-Measure-Reduce to
		create new variables that maintain the user-specified minimum
		level of information. Each reduced variable is also
		interpretable: the original variables map to one and only one
		variable in the reduced data set. 'partition' is flexible, as
		well: how variables are selected to reduce, how information
		loss is measured, and the way data is reduced can all be
		customized.  'partition' is based on the Partition framework
		discussed in Millstein et al. (2020)
