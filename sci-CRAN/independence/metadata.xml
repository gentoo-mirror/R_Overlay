		Fast Rank-Based Independence Testing // Performs three ranking-
		based nonparametric tests for the independence of two
		continuous variables: (1) the classical Hoeffding's D test; (2)
		a refined variant of it, named R; (3) the Bergsma-Dassios T*
		sign covariance. The first test is consistent assuming an
		absolutely continuous bivariate distribution, i.e., the
		population coefficient D=0 iff the variables are independent.
		The latter two are consistent under no restriction on the
		distribution. All three statistics are computed in time O(n log
		n) given n iid paired samples. The computation of R and T* uses
		a new algorithm, following work of Even-Zohar and Leng (2019),
		see arXiv:1911.01414 and references therein.
