		Local Pattern Analysis // Describes spatial patterns of
		categorical raster data for any defined regular and irregular
		areas. Patterns are described quantitatively using built-in
		signatures based on co-occurrence matrices but also allows for
		any user-defined functions. It enables spatial analysis such as
		search, change detection, and clustering to be performed on
		spatial patterns (Nowosad (2021)
		doi:10.1007/s10980-020-01135-0).
