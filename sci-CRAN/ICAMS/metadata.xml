		In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures
		('ICAMS') // Analysis and visualization of experimentally
		elucidated mutational signatures -- the kind of analysis and
		visualization in Boot et al., "In-depth characterization of the
		cisplatin mutational signature in human cell lines and in
		esophageal and liver tumors", Genome Research 2018,
		doi:10.1101/gr.230219.117 and "Characterization of colibactin-
		associated mutational signature in an Asian oral squamous cell
		carcinoma and in other mucosal tumor types", Genome Research
		2020 doi:10.1101/gr.255620.119. 'ICAMS' stands for In-depth
		Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures. 'ICAMS'
		has functions to read in variant call files (VCFs) and to
		collate the corresponding catalogs of mutational spectra and to
		analyze and plot catalogs of mutational spectra and signatures.
		Handles both "counts-based" and "density-based" catalogs of
		mutational spectra or signatures.
