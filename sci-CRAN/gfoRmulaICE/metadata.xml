		Parametric Iterative Conditional Expectation G-Formula //
		Implements iterative conditional expectation (ICE) estimators
		of the plug-in g-formula (Wen, Young, Robins, and Hernn (2020)
		doi: 10.1111/biom.13321). Both singly robust and doubly robust
		ICE estimators based on parametric models are available. The
		package can be used to estimate survival curves under sustained
		treatment strategies (interventions) using longitudinal data
		with time-varying treatments, time-varying confounders,
		censoring, and competing events. The interventions can be
		static or dynamic, and deterministic or stochastic (including
		threshold interventions). Both prespecified and user-defined
		interventions are available.
