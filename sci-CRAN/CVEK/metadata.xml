		Cross-Validated Kernel Ensemble // Implementation of Cross-
		Validated Kernel Ensemble (CVEK), a flexible modeling framework
		for robust nonlinear regression and hypothesis testing based on
		ensemble learning with kernel-ridge estimators (Jeremiah et al.
		(2017) arXiv:1710.01406 and Wenying et al. (2018)
		arXiv:1811.11025). It allows user to conduct nonlinear
		regression with minimal assumption on the function form by
		aggregating nonlinear models generated from a diverse
		collection of kernel families. It also provides utilities to
		test for the estimated nonlinear effect under this ensemble
		estimator, using either the asymptotic or the bootstrap version
		of a generalized score test.
