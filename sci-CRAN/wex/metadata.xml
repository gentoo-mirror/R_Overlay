		Compute the Exact Observation Weights for the Kalman Filter and
		Smoother // Computes the exact observation weights for the
		Kalman filter and smoother, based on the method described in
		Koopman and Harvey (2003)
		www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188902000611.
		The package supports in-depth exploration of state-space
		models, enabling researchers and practitioners to extract
		meaningful insights from time series data. This functionality
		is especially valuable in dynamic factor models, where the
		computed weights can be used to decompose the contributions of
		individual variables to the latent factors. See the README file
		for examples.
