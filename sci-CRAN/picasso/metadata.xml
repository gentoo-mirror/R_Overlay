		Pathwise Calibrated Sparse Shooting Algorithm // Computationally
		efficient tools for fitting generalized linear models and
		square root loss linear model with convex or non-convex
		penalty. Users can enjoy the superior statistical property of
		non-convex penalty such as SCAD and MCP which has significantly
		less estimation error and overfitting compared to convex
		penalty such as lasso and ridge. Computation is handled by
		multi-stage convex relaxation and the PathwIse CAlibrated
		Sparse Shooting algOrithm (PICASSO) which exploits warm start
		initialization, active set updating, and strong rule for
		coordinate preselection to boost computation, and attains a
		linear convergence to a unique sparse local optimum with
		optimal statistical properties. The computation is memory-
		optimized using the sparse matrix output.
