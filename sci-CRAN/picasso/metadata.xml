		Pathwise Calibrated Sparse Shooting Algorithm // Computationally
		efficient tools for fitting generalized linear model with
		convex or non-convex penalty. Users can enjoy the superior
		statistical property of non-convex penalty such as SCAD and MCP
		which has significantly less estimation error and overfitting
		compared to convex penalty such as lasso and ridge. Computation
		is handled by multi-stage convex relaxation and the PathwIse
		CAlibrated Sparse Shooting algOrithm (PICASSO) which exploits
		warm start initialization, active set updating, and strong rule
		for coordinate preselection to boost computation, and attains a
		linear convergence to a unique sparse local optimum with
		optimal statistical properties. The computation is memory-
		optimized using the sparse matrix output.
