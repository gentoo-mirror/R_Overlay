		Test of Between-Group Differences in the Onset of Senescence //
		Implementation of a likelihood ratio test of differential onset
		of senescence between two groups. Given two groups with
		measures of age and of an individual trait likely to be
		subjected to senescence (e.g. body mass), 'OnAge' provides an
		asymptotic p-value for the null hypothesis that senescence
		starts at the same age in both groups. The package implements
		the procedure used in Douhard et al. (2017)
