		Measures for Comparing Clusters // Given a set of data points, a
		clustering is defined as a disjoint partition where each pair
		of sets in a partition has no overlapping elements. This
		package provides 25 methods that play a role somewhat similar
		to distance or metric that measures similarity of two
		clusterings - or partitions. For a more detailed description,
		see Meila, M. (2005) doi:10.1145/1102351.1102424.
