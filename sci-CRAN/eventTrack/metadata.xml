		Event Prediction for Time-to-Event Endpoints // Implements the
		hybrid framework for event prediction described in Fang  Zheng
		(2011, doi:10.1016/j.cct.2011.05.013). To estimate the survival
		function the event prediction is based on, a piecewise
		exponential hazard function is fit to the time-to-event data to
		infer the potential change points. Prior to the last identified
		change point, the survival function is estimated using Kaplan-
		Meier, and the tail after the change point is fit using
		piecewise exponential.
