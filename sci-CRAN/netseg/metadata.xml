		Measures of Network Segregation and Homophily // Segregation is a
		network-level property such that edges between predefined
		groups of vertices are relatively less likely. Network
		homophily is a individual-level tendency to form relations with
		people who are similar on some attribute (e.g. gender, music
		taste, social status, etc.). In general homophily leads to
		segregation, but segregation might arise without homophily.
		This package implements descriptive indices measuring
		homophily/segregation. It is a computational companion to
