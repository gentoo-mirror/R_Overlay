		Bootstrap Methods for Complete Survey Data // Bootstrap
		resampling methods have been widely studied in the context of
		survey data. This package implements various bootstrap
		resampling techniques tailored for survey data, with a focus on
		stratified simple random sampling and stratified two-stage
		cluster sampling. It provides tools for precise and consistent
		bootstrap variance estimation for population totals, means, and
		quartiles. Additionally, it enables easy generation of
		bootstrap samples for in-depth analysis.
