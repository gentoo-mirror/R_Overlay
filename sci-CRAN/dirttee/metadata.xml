		Distributional Regression for Time to Event Data //
		Semiparametric distributional regression methods (expectile,
		quantile and mode regression) for time-to-event variables with
		right-censoring; uses inverse probability of censoring weights
		or accelerated failure time models with auxiliary likelihoods.
		Expectile regression using inverse probability of censoring
		weights has been introduced in Seipp et al. (2021) "Weighted
		Expectile Regression for Right-Censored Data"
		doi:10.1002/sim.9137, mode regression for time-to-event
		variables has been introduced in Seipp et al. (2022) "Flexible
		Semiparametric Mode Regression for Time-to-Event Data"
		doi:10.1177/09622802221122406.
