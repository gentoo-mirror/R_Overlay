		Compare Two Classifications or Clustering Solutions of Varying
		Structure // Compare two classifications or clustering
		solutions that may or may not have the same number of classes,
		and that might have hard or soft (fuzzy, probabilistic)
		membership. Calculate various metrics to assess how the
		clusters compare to each other. The calculations are simple,
		but provide a handy tool for users unfamiliar with matrix
		multiplication. This package is not geared towards traditional
		accuracy assessment for classification/ mapping applications -
		the motivating use case is for comparing a probabilistic
		clustering solution to a set of reference or existing class
		labels that could have any number of classes (that is, without
		having to degrade the probabilistic clustering to hard
		classes).
