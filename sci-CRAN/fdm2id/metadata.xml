		Data Mining and R Programming for Beginners // Contains functions
		to simplify the use of data mining methods (classification,
		regression, clustering, etc.), for students and beginners in R
		programming. Various R packages are used and wrappers are built
		around the main functions, to standardize the use of data
		mining methods (input/output): it brings a certain loss of
		flexibility, but also a gain of simplicity. The package name
		came from the French "Fouille de Donnes en Master 2
		Informatique Dcisionnelle".
