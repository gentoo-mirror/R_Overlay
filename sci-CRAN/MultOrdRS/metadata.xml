		Model Multivariate Ordinal Responses Including Response Styles //
		In the case of multivariate ordinal responses, parameter
		estimates can be severely biased if personal response styles
		are ignored. This packages provides methods to account for
		personal response styles and to explain the effects of
		covariates on the response style, as proposed by Schauberger
		and Tutz 2021 doi:10.1177/1471082X20978034. The method is
		implemented both for the multivariate cumulative model and the
		multivariate adjacent categories model.
