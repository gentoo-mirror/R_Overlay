		Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) Quality
		Assessment // The goal of 'LCMSQA' is to make it easy to check
		the quality of liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)
		experiments using a 'shiny' application. This package provides
		interactive data visualizations for quality control (QC)
		samples, including total ion current chromatogram (TIC), base
		peak chromatogram (BPC), mass spectrum, extracted ion
		chromatogram (XIC), and feature detection results from internal
		standards or known metabolites.
