		Work with Open Road Traffic Casualty Data from Great Britain //
		Tools to help download, process and analyse the UK road
		collision data collected using the 'STATS19' form. The datasets
		are provided as 'CSV' files with detailed road safety
		information about the circumstances of car crashes and other
		incidents on the roads resulting in casualties in Great Britain
		from 1979 to present. Tables are available on 'colissions' with
		the circumstances (e.g. speed limit of road), information about
		'vehicles' involved (e.g. type of vehicle), and 'casualties'
		(e.g. age). The statistics relate only to events on public
		roads that were reported to the police, and subsequently
		recorded, using the 'STATS19' accident reporting form. See the
		Department for Transport website https://www.data.gov.uk/datase
		t/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data for
		more information on these datasets. The package is described in
		a paper in the Journal of Open Source Software (Lovelace et al.
		2019) doi:10.21105/joss.01181. See Gilardi et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1111/rssa.12823, Vidal-Tortosa et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1016/j.jth.2021.101291, and Tait et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1016/j.aap.2022.106895 for examples of how the data can
		be used for methodological and empirical road safety research.
