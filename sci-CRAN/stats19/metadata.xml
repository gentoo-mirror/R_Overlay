		Work with Open Road Traffic Casualty Data from Great Britain //
		Tools to help process and analyse the UK road collision data
		collected using the 'STATS19' form. The data are provided as
		'CSV' files with detailed road safety data about the
		circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great
		Britain from 1979, the types (including make and model) of
		vehicles involved and the consequential casualties.  The
		statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public
		roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently
		recorded, using the 'STATS19' accident reporting form. See the
		Department for Transportation website https://data.gov.uk/datas
		et/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data for
		more information on these data.
