		Computes Statistics from Discrimination Experimental Data // In
		discrimination experiments candidates are sent on the same test
		(e.g. job, house rental) and one examines whether they receive
		the same outcome. The number of non negative answers are first
		examined in details looking for outcome differences. Then
		various answering rates and their exacts confidence intervals
		are computed. Last, exact and asymptotic discrimination tests
		are performed. Graphical methods are also available.
