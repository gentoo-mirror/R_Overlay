		Computes Statistics from Discrimination Experimental Data // In
		discrimination experiments candidates are sent on the same test
		(e.g. job, house rental) and one examines whether they receive
		the same outcome. The number of non negative answers are first
		examined in details looking for outcome differences. Then
		various statistics are computed. This package can also be used
		for analyzing the results from random experiments.
