		Clear Monitor and Graphing Software Processing Gaussian .log File
		// Self-Consistent Field(SCF) calculation method is one of the
		most important steps in the calculation methods of quantum
		chemistry. Ehrenreich, H.,  Cohen, M. H. (1959).
		doi:10.1103/PhysRev.115.786 However, the most prevailing
		software in this area, 'Gaussian''s SCF convergence process is
		hard to monitor, especially while the job is still running,
		causing researchers difficulty in knowing whether the
		oscillation has started or not, wasting time and energy on
		useless configurations or abandoning the jobs that can actually
		work. M.J. Frisch, G.W. Trucks, H.B. Schlegel et al. (2016).
		https://gaussian.com 'SCFMonitor' enables 'Gaussian' quantum
		chemistry calculation software users to easily read the
		'Gaussian' .log files and monitor the SCF convergence and
		geometry optimization process with little effort and clear,
		beautiful, and clean outputs. It can generate graphs using
		'tidyverse' to let users check SCF convergence and geometry
		optimization processes in real-time. The software supports
		processing .log files remotely using with rbase::url(). This
		software is a suitcase for saving time and energy for the
		researchers, supporting multiple versions of 'Gaussian'.
