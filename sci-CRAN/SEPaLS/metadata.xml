		Shrinkage for Extreme Partial Least-Squares (SEPaLS) //
		Regression context for the Partial Least Squares framework for
		Extreme values. Estimations of the Shrinkage for Extreme
		Partial Least-Squares (SEPaLS) estimators, an adaptation of the
		original Partial Least Squares (PLS) method tailored to the
		extreme-value framework. The SEPaLS project is a joint work by
		Stephane Girard, Hadrien Lorenzo and Julyan Arbel. R code to
		replicate the results of the paper is available at
		https://github.com/hlorenzo/SEPaLS_simus. Extremes within PLS
		was already studied by one of the authors, see M Bousebeta, G
		Enjolras, S Girard (2023) doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2022.105101.
