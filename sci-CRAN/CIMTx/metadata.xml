		Causal Inference for Multiple Treatments with a Binary Outcome //
		Different methods to conduct causal inference for multiple
		treatments with a binary outcome, including regression
		adjustment, vector matching, Bayesian additive regression
		trees, targeted maximum likelihood and inverse probability of
		treatment weighting using different generalized propensity
		score models such as multinomial logistic regression,
		generalized boosted models and super learner. For more details,
		see the paper by Hu et al. doi:10.1177/0962280220921909.
