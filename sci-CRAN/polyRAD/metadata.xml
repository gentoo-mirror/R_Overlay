		Genotype Calling with Uncertainty from Sequencing Data in
		Polyploids and Diploids // Read depth data from genotyping-by-
		sequencing (GBS) or restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
		(RAD-seq) are imported and used to make Bayesian probability
		estimates of genotypes in polyploids or diploids.  The genotype
		probabilities, posterior mean genotypes, or most probable
		genotypes can then be exported for downstream analysis.
		'polyRAD' is described by Clark et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1534/g3.118.200913.  A variant calling pipeline for
		highly duplicated genomes is also included and is described by
		Clark et al. (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.01.11.902890.
