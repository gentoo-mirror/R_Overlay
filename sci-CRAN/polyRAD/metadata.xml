		Genotype Calling with Uncertainty from Sequencing Data in
		Polyploids and Diploids // Read depth data from genotyping-by-
		sequencing (GBS) or restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
		(RAD-seq) are imported and used to make Bayesian probability
		estimates of genotypes in polyploids or diploids.  The genotype
		probabilities, or genotypes sampled from those probabilties,
		can then be exported for downstream analysis.  'polyRAD' is
		described by Clark et al. (2019) doi:10.1534/g3.118.200913.
