		Circle Manhattan Plot // Manhattan plot, a type of scatter plot,
		was widely used to display the association results. However, it
		is usually time-consuming and laborious for a non-specialist
		user to write scripts and adjust parameters of an elaborate
		plot. Moreover, the ever-growing traits measured have
		necessitated the integration of results from different Genome-
		wide association study researches. Circle Manhattan Plot is the
		first open R package that can lay out. Genome-wide association
		study P-value results in both traditional rectangular patterns,
		QQ-plot and novel circular ones. United in only one bull's eye
		style plot, association results from multiple traits can be
		compared interactively, thereby to reveal both similarities and
		differences between signals. Additional functions include:
		hightlight signals, a group of SNPs, chromosome visualization
		and candidate genes around SNPs.
