		A Lightweight and Lightning-Fast Taxonomic Naming Interface //
		Creates a local Lightning Memory-Mapped Database ('LMDB') of
		many commonly used taxonomic authorities and provides functions
		that can quickly query this data. Supported taxonomic
		authorities include the Integrated Taxonomic Information System
		('ITIS'), National Center for Biotechnology Information
		('NCBI'), Global Biodiversity Information Facility ('GBIF'),
		Catalogue of Life ('COL'), and Open Tree Taxonomy ('OTT'). Name
		and identifier resolution using 'LMDB' can be hundreds of times
		faster than either relational databases or internet-based
		queries. Precise data provenance information for data derived
		from naming providers is also included.
