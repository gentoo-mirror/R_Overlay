		Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage // Implements the multivariate
		adaptive shrinkage (mash) method of Urbut et al (2019)
		DOI:10.1038/s41588-018-0268-8 for estimating and testing large
		numbers of effects in many conditions (or many outcomes). Mash
		takes an empirical Bayes approach to testing and effect
		estimation; it estimates patterns of similarity among
		conditions, then exploits these patterns to improve accuracy of
		the effect estimates. The core linear algebra is implemented in
		C++ for fast model fitting and posterior computation.
