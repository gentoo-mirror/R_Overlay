		Some 'MASS' Enhancements // Some enhancements, extensions and
		additions to the facilities of the recommended 'MASS' package
		that are useful mainly for teaching purposes, with more
		convenient default settings and user interfaces. Key functions
		from 'MASS' are imported and re-exported to avoid masking
		conflicts.  In addition we provide some additional functions
		mainly used to illustrate coding paradigms and techniques, such
		as Gramm-Schmidt orthogonalisation and generalised eigenvalue
		problems.
