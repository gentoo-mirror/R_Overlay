		Reproducible Open Coding Kit // The Reproducible Open Coding Kit
		('ROCK', and this package, 'rock') was developed to facilitate
		reproducible and open coding, specifically geared towards
		qualitative research methods. It was developed to be both
		human- and machine-readable, in the spirit of MarkDown and
		'YAML'. The idea is that this makes it relatively easy to write
		other functions and packages to process 'ROCK' files. The
		'rock' package contains functions for basic coding and
		analysis, such as collecting and showing coded fragments and
		prettifying sources, as well as a number of advanced analyses
		such as the Qualitative Network Approach and
		Qualitative/Unified Exploration of State Transitions. The
		'ROCK' and this 'rock' package are described in the ROCK book
		(Zrg  Peters, 2022; https://rockbook.org), in Zrg  Peters
		(2024) doi:10.1080/21642850.2022.2119144 and Peters, Zrg and
		van der Maas (2022) doi:10.31234/osf.io/cvf52, and more
		information and tutorials are available at
