		Reproducible Open Coding Kit // The Reproducible Open Coding Kit
		('ROCK', and this package, 'rock') was developed to facilitate
		reproducible and open coding, specifically geared towards
		qualitative research methods. Although it is a general-purpose
		toolkit, three specific applications have been implemented,
		specifically an interface to the 'rENA' package that implements
		Epistemic Network Analysis ('ENA'), means to process notes from
		Cognitive Interviews ('CIs'), and means to work with
		decentralized construct taxonomies ('DCTs').
