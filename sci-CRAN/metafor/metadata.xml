		Meta-Analysis Package for R // A comprehensive collection of
		functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package
		includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome
		measures, fit fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such
		data, carry out moderator and meta-regression analyses, and
		create various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest,
		funnel, radial, L'Abbe, Baujat plots). For meta-analyses of
		binomial and person-time data, the package also provides
		functions that implement specialized methods, including the
		Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method, and a variety of
		suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e.,
		mixed-effects logistic and Poisson regression models). Finally,
		the package provides functionality for fitting meta-analytic
		multivariate/multilevel models that account for non-independent
		sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g., due to the inclusion
		of multiple treatment studies, multiple endpoints, or other
		forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses and meta-analyses
		accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to
		phylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted.
