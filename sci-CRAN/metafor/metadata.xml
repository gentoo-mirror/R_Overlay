		Meta-Analysis Package for R // A comprehensive collection of
		functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package
		includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome
		measures, fit equal-, fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models
		to such data, carry out moderator and meta-regression analyses,
		and create various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g.,
		forest, funnel, radial, L'Abbe, Baujat, bubble, and GOSH
		plots). For meta-analyses of binomial and person-time data, the
		package also provides functions that implement specialized
		methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method,
		and a variety of suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects)
		models (i.e., mixed-effects logistic and Poisson regression
		models). Finally, the package provides functionality for
		fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel models that
		account for non-independent sampling errors and/or true effects
		(e.g., due to the inclusion of multiple treatment studies,
		multiple endpoints, or other forms of clustering). Network
		meta-analyses and meta-analyses accounting for known
		correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic relatedness)
		can also be conducted. An introduction to the package can be
		found in Viechtbauer (2010) doi:10.18637/jss.v036.i03.
