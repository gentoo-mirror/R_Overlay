		Statistical Tools for Covariance Analysis // Covariance is of
		universal prevalence across various disciplines within
		statistics. We provide a rich collection of geometric and
		inferential tools for convenient analysis of covariance
		structures, topics including distance measures, mean covariance
		estimator, covariance hypothesis test for one-sample and two-
		sample cases, and covariance estimation. For an introduction to
		covariance in multivariate statistical analysis, see Schervish
		(1987) doi:10.1214/ss/1177013111.
