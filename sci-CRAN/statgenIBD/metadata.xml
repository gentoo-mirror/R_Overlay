		Calculation of IBD Probabilities // For biparental, three and
		four-way crosses Identity by Descent (IBD) probabilities can be
		calculated using Hidden Markov Models and inheritance vectors
		following Lander and Green (https://www.jstor.org/stable/29713)
		and Huang (doi:10.1073/pnas.1100465108). One of a series of
		statistical genetic packages for streamlining the analysis of
		typical plant breeding experiments developed by Biometris.
