		Local Randomization Methods for RD Designs // The regression
		discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-experimental
		design for causal inference and policy evaluation. Under the
		local randomization approach, RD designs can be interpreted as
		randomized experiments inside a window around the cutoff. This
		package provides tools to perform randomization inference for
		RD designs under local randomization: rdrandinf() to perform
		hypothesis testing using randomization inference, rdwinselect()
		to select a window around the cutoff in which randomization is
		likely to hold, rdsensitivity() to assess the sensitivity of
		the results to different window lengths and null hypotheses and
		rdrbounds() to construct Rosenbaum bounds for sensitivity to
		unobserved confounders. See Cattaneo, Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare
		(2016) https://rdpackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-
		Titiunik-VazquezBare_2016_Stata.pdf for further methodological
		details.
