		Verify the Scale, Anisotropy and Direction of Weather Forecasts
		// Implementation of the wavelet-based spatial verification
		method of Buschow and Friederichs "SAD: Verifying the Scale,
		Anisotropy and Direction of precipitation forecasts" (2020,
		submitted to QJRMS). Forecasts and Observations are transformed
		by a decimated or redundant dual-tree complex wavelet transform
		to analyze the spatial scale, degree of anisotropy and
		preferred direction in each field. These structural attributes
		are compared by a series of scores. An experimental algorithm
		for the correction of these errors is included as well.
