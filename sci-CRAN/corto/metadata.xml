		Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks // We present 'corto'
		(Correlation Tool), a simple package to infer gene regulatory
		networks and visualize master regulators from gene expression
		data using DPI (Data Processing Inequality) and bootstrapping
		to recover edges. An initial step is performed to calculate all
		significant edges between a list of source nodes (centroids)
		and target genes. Then all triplets containing two centroids
		and one target are tested in a DPI step which removes edges. A
		bootstrapping process then calculates the robustness of the
		network, eventually re-adding edges previously removed by DPI.
		The algorithm has been optimized to run outside a computing
		cluster, using a fast correlation implementation. The package
		finally provides functions to calculate network enrichment
		analysis from RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq signatures as described in
		the article by Giorgi lab (2020)
