		Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks // We present 'corto'
		(Correlation Tool), a simple package to infer gene regulatory
		networks and visualize master regulators from gene expression
		data using DPI (Data Processing Inequality) and bootstrapping
		to recover edges. An initial step is performed to calculate all
		significant edges between a list of source nodes (centroids)
		and target genes. Then all triplets containing two centroids
		and one target are tested in a DPI step which removes edges. A
		bootstrapping process then calculates the robustness of the
		network, eventually re-adding edges previously removed by DPI.
		The package implements a similar pipeline as ARACNe-AP
		(Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks
		with Adaptive Partitioning) by Giorgi (2016)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw216) with optimizations to run
		outside a  computing cluster (most notably correlation to infer
		feature dependencies instead of Mutual Information).
