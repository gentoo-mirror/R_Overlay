		Agent Based Model Simulation Framework // A high-performance,
		flexible and extensible framework to develop continuous-time
		agent based models. Its high performance allows it to simulate
		millions of agents efficiently. Agents are defined by their
		states (arbitrary R lists). The events are handled in
		chronological order. This avoids the multi-event interaction
		problem in a time step of discrete-time simulations, and gives
		precise outcomes. The states are modified by provided or user-
		defined events. The framework provides a flexible and
		customizable implementation of state transitions (either
		spontaneous or caused by agent interactions), making the
		framework suitable to apply to epidemiology and ecology, e.g.,
		to model life history stages, competition and cooperation, and
		disease and information spread. The agent interactions are
		flexible and extensible. The framework provides random mixing
		and network interactions, and supports multi-level mixing
		patterns.  It can be easily extended to other interactions such
		as inter- and intra-households (or workplaces and schools) by
		subclassing an R6 class. It can be used to study the effect of
		age-specific, group-specific, and contact- specific
		intervention strategies, and complex interactions between
		individual behavior and population dynamics. This modeling
		concept can also be used in business, economical and political
		models. As a generic event based framework, it can be applied
		to many other fields. More information about the implementation
		and examples can be found at https://github.com/junlingm/ABM.
