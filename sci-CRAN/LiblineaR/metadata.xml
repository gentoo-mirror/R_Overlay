		Linear Predictive Models Based on the 'LIBLINEAR' C/C++ Library
		// A wrapper around the 'LIBLINEAR' C/C++ library for machine
		learning (available at
		http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear). 'LIBLINEAR' is a
		simple library for solving large-scale regularized linear
		classification and regression. It currently supports
		L2-regularized classification (such as logistic regression,
		L2-loss linear SVM and L1-loss linear SVM) as well as
		L1-regularized classification (such as L2-loss linear SVM and
		logistic regression) and L2-regularized support vector
		regression (with L1- or L2-loss). The main features of
		LiblineaR include multi-class classification (one-vs-the rest,
		and Crammer  Singer method), cross validation for model
		selection, probability estimates (logistic regression only) or
		weights for unbalanced data. The estimation of the models is
		particularly fast as compared to other libraries.
