		Generates Muller Plot from Population/Abundance/Frequency
		Dynamics Data // Generates Muller plot from
		parental/genealogy/phylogeny information and
		population/abundance/frequency dynamics data. Muller plots are
		plots which combine information about succession of different
		OTUs (genotypes, phenotypes, species, ...) and information
		about dynamics of their abundances (populations or frequencies)
		over time. They are powerful and fascinating tools to visualize
		evolutionary dynamics. They may be employed also in study of
		diversity and its dynamics, i.e. how diversity emerges and how
		changes over time. They are called Muller plots in honor of
		Hermann Joseph Muller which used them to explain his idea of
		Muller's ratchet (Muller, 1932, American Naturalist). A big
		difference between Muller plots and normal box plots of
		abundances is that a Muller plot depicts not only the relative
		abundances but also succession of OTUs based on their
		genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation. In a Muller plot,
		horizontal axis is time/generations and vertical axis
		represents relative abundances of OTUs at the corresponding
		times/generations. Different OTUs are usually shown with
		polygons with different colors and each OTU originates
		somewhere in the middle of its parent area in order to
		illustrate their succession in evolutionary process. To
		generate a Muller plot one needs the
		genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation of OTUs and their
		abundances over time. MullerPlot package has the tools to
		generate Muller plots which clearly depict the origin of
		successors of OTUs.
