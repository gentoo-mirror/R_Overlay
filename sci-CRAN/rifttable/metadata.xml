		Results Tables to Bridge the Rift Between Epidemiologists and
		Their Data // Presentation-ready results tables for
		epidemiologists in an automated, reproducible fashion. The user
		provides the final analytical dataset and specifies the design
		of the table, with rows and/or columns defined by exposure(s),
		effect modifier(s), and estimands as desired, allowing to show
		descriptors and inferential estimates in one table -- bridging
		the rift between epidemiologists and their data, one table at a
		time. See Rothman (2017) doi:10.1007/s10654-017-0314-3.
