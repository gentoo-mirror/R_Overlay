		Binomial Random Forest Feature Selection // The 'binomialRF' is a
		new feature selection technique for decision trees that aims at
		providing an alternative approach to identify significant
		feature subsets using binomial distributional assumptions
		(Rachid Zaim, S., et al. (2019)) doi:10.1101/681973. Treating
		each splitting variable selection as a set of exchangeable
		correlated Bernoulli trials, 'binomialRF' then tests whether a
		feature is selected more often than by random chance.
