		Multiple Time Series Scanner // Generate interactive html reports
		that enable quick visual review of multiple related time series
		stored in a data frame. For static datasets, this can help to
		identify any temporal artefacts that may affect the validity of
		subsequent analyses. For live data feeds, regularly scheduled
		reports can help to pro-actively identify data feed problems or
		unexpected trends that may require action. The reports are
		self-contained and shareable without a web server.
