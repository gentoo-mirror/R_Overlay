		Visualising Statistical Models using Dynamic Nomograms //
		Demonstrate the results of a statistical model object as a
		dynamic nomogram in an RStudio panel or web browser. The
		package provides two generics functions: DynNom, which display
		statistical model objects as a dynamic nomogram; DNbuilder,
		which builds required scripts to publish a dynamic nomogram on
		a web server such as the https://www.shinyapps.io/. Current
		version of 'DynNom' supports stats::lm, stats::glm,
		survival::coxph, rms::ols, rms::Glm, rms::lrm, rms::cph, and
		mgcv::gam model objects.
