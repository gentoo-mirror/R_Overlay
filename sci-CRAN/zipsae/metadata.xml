		Small Area Estimation with Zero-Inflated Model // This function
		produces empirical best linier unbiased predictions (EBLUPs)
		for Zero-Inflated data and its Relative Standard Error. Small
		Area Estimation with Zero-Inflated Model (SAE-ZIP) is a model
		developed for Zero-Inflated data that can lead us to
		overdispersion situation. To handle this kind of situation,
		this model is created. The model in this package is based on
		Small Area Estimation with Zero-Inflated Poisson model proposed
		by Dian Christien Arisona
		(2018)https://repository.ipb.ac.id/handle/123456789/92308. For
		the data sample itself, we use combination method between
		Roberto Benavent and Domingo Morales

		Boonstra and Marc Smeets (2016)doi:10.1515/jos-2016-0051.
