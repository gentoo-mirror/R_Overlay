		Hierarchical and Geographically Weighted Regression // This model
		divides coefficients into three types, i.e., local fixed
		effects, global fixed effects, and random effects (Hu et al.,
		2022)doi:10.1177/23998083211063885. If data have spatial
		hierarchical structures (especially are overlapping on some
		locations), it is worth trying this model to reach better
		fitness.
