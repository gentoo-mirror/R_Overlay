		Hierarchical and Geographically Weighted Regression // This model
		divides coefficients into three types, i.e., local fixed
		effects, global fixed effects, and random effects. If data have
		spatial hierarchical structures (especially are overlapping on
		some locations), it is worth trying this model to reach better
		fitness.
