		Rank of Variables Based on Principal Component Analysis for Mixed
		Data Types // Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a
		statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a
		dataset while preserving as much variability as possible. By
		transforming the original variables into a new set of
		uncorrelated variables called principal components, PCA helps
		in identifying patterns and simplifying the complexity of high-
		dimensional data. The 'RankPCA' package provides a streamlined
		workflow for performing PCA on datasets containing both
		categorical and continuous variables. It facilitates data
		preprocessing, encoding of categorical variables, and computes
		PCA to determine the optimal number of principal components
		based on a specified variance threshold. The package also
		computes composite indices for ranking observations, which can
		be useful for various analytical purposes. Garai, S.,  Paul, R.
