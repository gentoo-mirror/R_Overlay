		Metrics for Multiple Testing with Correlated Outcomes //
		Implements methods in Mathur and VanderWeele (in preparation)
		to characterize global evidence strength across W correlated
		ordinary least squares (OLS) hypothesis tests. Specifically,
		uses resampling to estimate a null interval for the total
		number of rejections in, for example, 95% of samples generated
		with no associations (the global null), the excess hits (the
		difference between the observed number of rejections and the
		upper limit of the null interval), and a test of the global
		null based on the number of rejections.
