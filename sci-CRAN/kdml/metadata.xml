		Kernel Distance Metric Learning for Mixed-Type Data // Distance
		metrics for mixed-type data consisting of continuous, nominal,
		and ordinal variables. This methodology uses additive and
		product kernels to calculate similarity functions and metrics,
		and selects variables relevant to the underlying distance
		through bandwidth selection via maximum similarity cross-
		validation. These methods can be used in any distance-based
		algorithm, such as distance-based clustering. For further
		details, we refer the reader to Ghashti and Thompson (2024)
		doi:10.1007/s00357-024-09493-z for dkps() methodology, and
		Ghashti (2024) doi:10.14288/1.0443975 for dkss() methodology.
