		R6 Reference Class Based Data Structures // Provides reference
		classes implementing some useful data structures. The package
		implements these data structures by using the reference class
		R6. Therefore, the classes of the data structures are also
		reference classes which means that their instances are passed
		by reference. The implemented data structures include stack,
		queue, double-ended queue, doubly linked list, set, dictionary
		and binary search tree. See for example
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure for more
		information about the data structures.
