		Bootstrap Tests for Equality of 2, 3, or 4 Population Variances
		// Tests the hypothesis  that variances are homogeneous or not
		using bootstrap. The procedure uses a variance-based statistic,
		and is derived from a normal-theory test. The test equivalently
		expressed the hypothesis as a function of the log contrasts of
		the population variances. A box-type acceptance region is
		constructed to test the hypothesis. See Cahoy (2010)
		\doi{10.1016/j.csda.2010.04.012}.
