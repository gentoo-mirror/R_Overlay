		Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping // Implements Time-Weighted
		Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW), a measure for quantifying time
		series similarity. The TWDTW algorithm, described in Maus et
		al. (2016) doi:10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2517118 and Maus et al.
		(2019) doi:10.18637/jss.v088.i05, is applicable to multi-
		dimensional time series of various resolutions. It is
		particularly suitable for comparing time series with
		seasonality for environmental and ecological data analysis,
		covering domains such as remote sensing imagery, climate data,
		hydrology, and animal movement. The 'twdtw' package offers a
		user-friendly 'R' interface, efficient 'Fortran' routines for
		TWDTW calculations, flexible time weighting definitions, as
		well as utilities for time series preprocessing and
		visualization.
