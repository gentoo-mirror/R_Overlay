		CBA Classifier // Provides implementations of a classifier based
		on the "Classification Based on Associations" (CBA). It can be
		used for building classification models from association rules.
		Rules are pruned in the order of precedence given by the sort
		criteria and a default rule is added. The final classifier
		labels provided instances. CBA was originally proposed by Liu,
		B. Hsu, W. and Ma, Y. Integrating Classification and
		Association Rule Mining. Proceedings KDD-98, New York, 27-31
		August. AAAI. pp80-86 (1998, ISBN:1-57735-070-7).
