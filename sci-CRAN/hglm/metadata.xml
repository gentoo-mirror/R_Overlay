		Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models // Implemented here are
		procedures for fitting hierarchical generalized linear models
		(HGLM). It can be used for linear mixed models and generalized
		linear mixed models with random effects for a variety of links
		and a variety of distributions for both the outcomes and the
		random effects. Fixed effects can also be fitted in the
		dispersion part of the mean model. As statistical models, HGLMs
		were initially developed by Lee and Nelder (1996)
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346105?seq=1. We provide an
		implementation (Ronnegard, Alam and Shen 2010) https://journal.
		r-project.org/archive/2010-2/RJournal_2010-2_Roennegaard~et~al.
		pdf following Lee, Nelder and Pawitan (2006) ISBN:
