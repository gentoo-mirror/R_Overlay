		Streamline Data Import, Cleaning and Recoding from 'Excel' // A
		small group of functions to read in a data dictionary and the
		corresponding data table from 'Excel' and to automate the
		cleaning, re-coding and creation of simple calculated
		variables. This package was designed to be a companion to the
		macro-enabled 'Excel' template available on the GitHub site,
		but works with any similarly-formatted 'Excel' data.
