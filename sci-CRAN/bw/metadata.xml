		Implementation of the dynamic weight change models for adults
		from "The Dynamics of Human Body Weight Change" by CC. Chow and
		KD. Hall (2008) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000045. As well as
		the children weight change model from "Dynamics of childhood
		growth and obesity: development and validation of a
		quantitative mathematical model" by KD. Hall, NF. Butte, BA.
		Swinburn, and CC. Chow (2013)
		doi:10.1016/S2213-8587(13)70051-2. These model the
