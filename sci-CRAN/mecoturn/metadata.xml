		Decipher Microbial Turnover along a Gradient // Two pipelines are
		provided to study microbial turnover along a gradient,
		including the beta diversity and microbial abundance change.
		The 'betaturn' class consists of the steps of community
		dissimilarity matrix generation, matrix conversion,
		differential test and visualization. The workflow of 'taxaturn'
		class includes the taxonomic abundance calculation, abundance
		transformation, abundance change summary, statistical analysis
		and visualization. Multiple statistical approaches can
		contribute to the analysis of microbial turnover.
