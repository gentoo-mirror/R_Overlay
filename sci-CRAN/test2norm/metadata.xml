		Normative Standards for Cognitive Tests // Package test2norm
		contains functions to generate formulas for normative standards
		applied to cognitive tests. It takes raw test scores (e.g.,
		number of correct responses) and converts them to scaled scores
		and demographically adjusted scores, using methods described in
		Heaton et al. (2003) doi:10.1016/B978-012703570-3/50010-9
		Heaton et al. (2009, ISBN:9780199702800). The scaled scores are
		calculated as quantiles of the raw test scores, scaled to have
		the mean of 10 and standard deviation of 3, such that higher
		values always correspond to better performance on the test. The
		demographically adjusted scores are calculated from the
		residuals of a model that regresses scaled scores on
		demographic predictors (e.g., age). The norming procedure makes
		use of the mfp2() function from the 'mfp2' package to explore
		nonlinear associations between cognition and demographic
		variables.
