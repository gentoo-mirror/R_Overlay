		Read and Write Column Text Format (CTF) // Column Text Format
		(CTF) is a new tabular data format designed for simplicity and
		performance. CTF is the simplest column store you can imagine:
		plain text files for each column in a table, and a metadata
		file. The underlying plain text means the data is human
		readable and familiar to programmers, unlike specialized binary
		formats. CTF is faster than row oriented formats like CSV when
		loading a subset of the columns in a table. This package
		provides functions to read and write CTF data from R.
