		Computational Graphs // Allows to create, evaluate, and
		differentiate computational graphs in R. A computational graph
		is a graph representation of a multivariate function decomposed
		by its (elementary) operations. Nodes in the graph represent
		arrays while edges represent dependencies among the arrays. An
		advantage of expressing a function as a computational graph is
		that this enables to differentiate the function by automatic
		differentiation. The 'cgraph' package supports various
		functions including basic arithmetic, trigonometry functions,
		and linear algebra functions. It differentiates computational
		graphs by reverse automatic differentiation. The flexible
		architecture of the package makes it applicable to solve a
		variety of problems including local sensitivity analysis,
		gradient-based optimization, and machine learning.
