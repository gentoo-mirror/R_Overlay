		Hidden Markov Modelling of Hydrological State Change //
		Identifies regime changes in streamflow runoff not explained by
		variations in precipitation. The package builds a flexible set
		of Hidden Markov Models of annual, seasonal or monthly
		streamflow runoff with precipitation as a predictor. Suites of
		models can be built for a single site, ranging from one to
		three states and each with differing combinations of error
		models and auto-correlation terms. The most parsimonious model
		is easily identified by AIC, and useful for understanding
