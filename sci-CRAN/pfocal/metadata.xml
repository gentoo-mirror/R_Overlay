		Fast Convolution of Matrices // Provides functions to create and
		apply convolution kernels to rectangular data (matrix, raster).
		Implements calculations of convolutions in parallel,
		emphasizing performance over convolution function diversity.
		Moving window calculations are common in many fields, from
		image processing to raster data manipulation. The process of
		ingesting values in the neighborhood of a each cell in a grid,
		passing them through a function, and returning a reduced value,
		is embarrassingly parallel. This package implements this with
		parallel C code. In doing so, it provides a much faster option
		than other similarly aimed packages and functions.
