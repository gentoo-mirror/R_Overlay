		Kernel Approaches for Nonlinear Genetic Association Regression //
		Methods to extract information on pathways, genes and SNPs from
		online databases. It provides functions for data preparation
		and evaluation of genetic influence on a binary outcome using
		the logistic kernel machine test (LKMT). Three different kernel
		functions are offered to analyze genotype information in this
		variance component test: A linear kernel, a size-adjusted
		kernel and a network based kernel.
