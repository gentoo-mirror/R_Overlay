		Additions and Extensions of the 'VGAM' Package // Extending the
		functionalities of the 'VGAM' package with additional functions
		and datasets. At present, 'VGAMextra' comprises new family
		functions (ffs) to estimate several time series models by
		maximum likelihood using Fisher scoring, unlike popular
		packages in CRAN relying on optim(), including ARMA-GARCH-like
		models, the Order-(p, d, q) ARIMAX model (non- seasonal), the
		Order-(p) VAR model, error correction models for cointegrated
		time series, and ARMA-structures with Student-t errors. For
		independent data, new ffs to estimate the inverse- Weibull, the
		inverse-gamma, the generalized beta of the second kind and the
		general multivariate normal distributions are available. In
		addition, 'VGAMextra' incorporates new VGLM-links for the mean-
		function, and the quantile-function (as an alternative to
		ordinary quantile modelling) of several 1-parameter
		distributions, that are compatible with the class of VGLM/VGAM
		family functions. Currently, only fixed-effects models are
		implemented. All functions are subject to change; see the NEWS
		for further details on the latest changes.
