		Replication Interval Functions // A common problem faced by
		journal reviewers and authors is the question of whether the
		results of a replication study are consistent with the original
		published study. One solution to this problem is to examine the
		effect size from the original study and generate the range of
		effect sizes that could reasonably be obtained (due to random
		sampling) in a replication attempt (i.e., calculate a
		replication interval). If a replication effect size falls
		outside the replication interval, then that effect likely did
		not occur due to the effects of sampling error alone.
		Alternatively, if a replication effect size falls within the
		replication interval, then the replication effect could have
		reasonably occurred due to the effects of sampling error alone.
		This package has functions that calculate the replication
		interval for the correlation (i.e., r), standardized mean
		difference (i.e., d-value), and mean. The calculations used in
		version 2.0.0 and onward differ from past calculations due to
		feedback during the journal review process. The new
		calculations allow for a more precise interpretation of the
		replication interval.
