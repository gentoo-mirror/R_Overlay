		Factor Big Integers with the Parallel Quadratic Sieve // Features
		the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve (MPQS) algorithm for
		factoring large integers and a vectorized factoring function
		that returns the complete factorization of an integer. The MPQS
		is based off of the seminal work of Carl Pomerance (1984)
		doi:10.1007/3-540-39757-4_17 along with the modification of
		multiple polynomials introduced by Peter Montgomery and J.
		Davis as outlined by Robert D. Silverman (1987)
		doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-1987-0866119-8. Utilizes the C library
		GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic) and 'RcppThread' for
		sieving multiple polynomials in parallel. The Pollard's rho
		algorithm for factoring smaller numbers is the same algorithm
		used by the factorize function in the 'gmp' package.
