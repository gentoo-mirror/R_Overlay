		Simulate and Sample from Ecological Interaction Networks //
		Randomly generate a wide range of interaction networks with
		specified size, average degree, modularity, and topological
		structure. Sample nodes and links from within simulated
		networks randomly, by degree, by module, or by abundance.
		Simulations and sampling routines are implemented in 'FORTRAN',
		providing efficient generation times even for large networks.
		Basic visualization methods also included. Algorithms
		implemented here are described in de Aguiar et al. (2017)
		arXiv:1708.01242.
