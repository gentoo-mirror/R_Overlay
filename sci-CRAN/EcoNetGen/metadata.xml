		Simulate and Sample from Ecological Interaction Networks //
		Generate a wide range of random networks given expected degree,
		'modularity', and structure.  Simulations and sampling routines
		are implemented in 'FORTRAN', providing efficient generation
		times even for large networks. Basic visualization methods also
		included.  Algorithms implemented here are described in de
		Aguiar et al. (2017) arXiv:1708.01242.
