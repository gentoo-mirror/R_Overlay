		Additive Heredity Model: Method for the Mixture-of-Mixtures
		Experiments // An implementation of the additive heredity model
		for the mixture-of-mixtures experiments of Shen et al. (2019)
		in Technometrics doi:10.1080/00401706.2019.1630010. The
		additive heredity model considers an additive structure to
		inherently connect the major components with the minor
		components. The additive heredity model has a meaningful
		interpretation for the estimated model because of the
		hierarchical and heredity principles applied and the
		nonnegative garrote technique used for variable selection.
