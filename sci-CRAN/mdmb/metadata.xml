		Model Based Treatment of Missing Data // Contains model-based
		treatment of missing data for regression models with missing
		values in covariates or the dependent variable using maximum
		likelihood or Bayesian estimation (Ibrahim et al., 2005;
		doi:10.1198/016214504000001844). T The regression model can be
		nonlinear (e.g., interaction quadratic effects or spline
		functions). Multilevel models with missing data in predictors
		is also available for Bayesian estimation. Substantive-model
		compatible multiple imputation can be also conducted.
