		Fast, Compact Iterators and Tools // A fresh take on iterators in
		R. Designed to be cross-compatible with the 'iterators'
		package, but using the 'nextOr' method will offer better
		performance as well as more compact code. With batteries
		included: includes a collection of iterator constructors and
		combinators ported and refined from the 'iterators',
		'itertools', and 'itertools2' packages.
