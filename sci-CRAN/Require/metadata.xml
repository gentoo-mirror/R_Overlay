		Installing and Loading R Packages for Reproducible Workflows // A
		single key function, 'Require' that makes rerun-tolerant
		versions of 'install.packages' and `require` for CRAN packages,
		packages no longer on CRAN (i.e., archived), specific versions
		of packages, and GitHub packages. This approach is developed to
		create reproducible workflows that are flexible and fast enough
		to use while in development stages, while able to build
		snapshots once a stable package collection is found. As with
		other functions in a reproducible workflow, this package
		emphasizes functions that return the same result whether it is
		the first or subsequent times running the function, with
		subsequent times being sufficiently fast that they can be run
		every time without undue waiting burden on the user or
		developer.
