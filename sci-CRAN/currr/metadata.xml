		Apply Mapping Functions in Frequent Saving // Implementations of
		the family of map() functions with frequent saving of the
		intermediate results. The contained functions let you start the
		evaluation of the iterations where you stopped  (reading the
		already evaluated ones from cache), and work with the currently
		evaluated iterations while remaining ones are running in a
		background job. Parallel computing is also easier with the
		workers parameter.
