		Sample Size Calculations for Normal Means // Sample size
		requirements calculation using three different Bayesian
		criteria in the context of designing an experiment to estimate
		a normal mean or the difference between two normal means.
		Functions for calculation of required sample sizes for the
		Average Length Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion and
		the Worst Outcome Criterion in the context of normal means are
		provided. Functions for both the fully Bayesian and the mixed
		Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided. For reference see
		Joseph L. and Blisle P. (1997)
