		Read in Fantasy Premier League Data // This data contains a large
		variety of information on players and their current attributes
		on Fantasy Premier League https://fantasy.premierleague.com/.
		In particular, it contains a `next_gw_points` (next gameweek
		points) value for each player given their attributes in the
		current week. Rows represent player-gameweeks, i.e. for each
		player there is a row for each gameweek. This makes the data
		suitable for modelling a player's next gameweek points, given
		attributes such as form, total points, and cost at the current
		gameweek. This data can therefore be used to create Fantasy
		Premier League bots that may use a machine learning algorithm
		and a linear programming solver (for example) to return the
		best possible transfers and team to pick for each gameweek,
		thereby fully automating the decision making process in Fantasy
		Premier League. This function simply supplies the required data
		for such a task.
