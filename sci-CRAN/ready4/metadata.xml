		Develop and Use Modular Health Economic Models // A template
		model module, tools to help find model modules derived from
		this template and a programming syntax to use these modules in
		health economic analyses.  These elements are the foundation
		for a prototype software framework for developing living and
		transferable models and using those models in reproducible
		health economic analyses. The software framework is extended by
		other R libraries.  For detailed documentation about the
		framework and how to use it visit https://www.ready4-dev.com/.
		For a background to the methodological issues that the
		framework is attempting to help solve, see Hamilton et al.
