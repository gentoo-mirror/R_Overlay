		Safety Diagnostics for Dose-Escalation Trial Designs // Enhances
		various R packages that support the design and simulation of
		phase 1 dose-escalation trials, adding diagnostics to examine
		the safety characteristics of these designs in light of
		expected inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetics and
		pharmacodynamics. See Norris (2020), "Retrospective analysis of
		a fatal dose-finding trial" arXiv:2004.12755.
