		Density, Probability, Quantile ('DPQ') Computations //
		Computations for approximations and alternatives for the 'DPQ'
		(Density (pdf), Probability (cdf) and Quantile) functions for
		probability distributions in R. Primary focus is on (central
		and non-central) beta, gamma and related distributions such as
		the chi-squared, F, and t. -- This is for the use of
		researchers in these numerical approximation implementations,
		notably for my own use in order to improve standard R pbeta(),
		qgamma(), ..., etc: {'"dpq"'-functions}.
