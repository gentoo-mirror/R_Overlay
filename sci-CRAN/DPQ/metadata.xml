		Density, Probability, Quantile ('DPQ') Computations //
		Computations for approximations and alternatives for the 'DPQ'
		(Density (pdf), Probability (cdf) and Quantile) functions for
		probability distributions in R. Primary focus is on (central
		and non-central) beta, gamma and related distributions such as
		the chi-squared, F, and t. -- For several distribution
		functions, provide functions implementing formulas from
		Johnson, Kotz, and Kemp (1992) doi:10.1002/bimj.4710360207  and
		Johnson, Kotz, and Balakrishnan (1995) for discrete or
		continuous distributions respectively. This is for the use of
		researchers in these numerical approximation implementations,
		notably for my own use in order to improve standard R pbeta(),
		qgamma(), ..., etc: {'"dpq"'-functions}.
