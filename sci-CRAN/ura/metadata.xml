		Monitoring Rater Reliability // Provides researchers with a
		simple set of diagnostic tools for monitoring the progress and
		reliability of raters conducting content coding tasks. Goehring
		(2023) https://bengoehring.github.io/files/ps-paper-anon-word-
		ca.docx argues that supervisors---especially supervisors of
		small teams---should utilize computational tools to monitor
		reliability in real time. As such, this package provides easy-
		to-use functions for calculating inter-rater reliability
		statistics and measuring the reliability of one coder compared
		to the rest of the team.
