		Clustering Time Series While Resisting Outliers // Robust
		Clustering of Time Series (RCTS) has the functionality to
		cluster time series using both the classical and the robust
		interactive fixed effects framework. The classical framework is
		developed in Ando  Bai (2017)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1195743. The implementation within
		this package excludes the SCAD-penalty on the estimations of
		beta. This robust framework is developed in Boudt  Heyndels
		(2022) doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2022.01.002 and is made robust
		against different kinds of outliers. The algorithm iteratively
		updates beta (the coefficients of the observable variables),
		group membership, and the latent factors (which can be common
		and/or group-specific) along with their loadings. The number of
		groups and factors can be estimated if they are unknown.
