		Rank Normal Transformation Omnibus Test // Inverse normal
		transformation (INT) based genetic association testing. These
		tests are recommend for continuous traits with non-normally
		distributed residuals. INT-based tests robustly control the
		type I error in settings where standard linear regression does
		not, as when the residual distribution exhibits excess skew or
		kurtosis. Moreover, INT-based tests dominate standard linear
		regression in terms of power. These tests may be classified
		into two types. In direct INT (D-INT), the phenotype is itself
		transformed. In indirect INT (I-INT), phenotypic residuals are
		transformed. The omnibus test (O-INT) adaptively combines D-INT
		and I-INT into a single robust and statistically powerful
		approach. See McCaw ZR, Lane JM, Saxena R, Redline S, Lin X.
