		Rank Normal Transformation Omnibus Test // Genetic association
		tests that use the rank-based inverse normal transformation
		(INT). These tests are recommend for continuous traits with
		non-normally distributed residuals. INT-based tests robustly
		control the type I error in settings where standard linear
		regression does not. Moreover, INT-based tests dominate
		standard linear regression in terms of power. INT-based tests
		may be classified into two types: tests that directly transform
		the phenotype (D-INT) and tests that transform phenotypic
		residuals (I-INT). Our omnibus test (O-INT) adaptively combines
		D-INT and I-INT into a single robust and statistically powerful
		approach.
