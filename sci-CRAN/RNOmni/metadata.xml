		Omnibus Test for Genetic Association Analysis using the Rank
		Normal Transformation // Implementation of genetic association
		tests for continuous outcomes utilizing the rank-based inverse
		normal transformation (INT). For outcomes whose residual
		distribution is heavily skewed or enriched for outliers, INT-
		based tests provided valid inference and improved power. The
		primary contribution is a rank normal omnibus test (RNOmni),
		which synthesizes two complementary INT-based approaches. In
		simulations against non-normal phenotypes, the omnibus test
		controlled the type I error in the absence of genetic
		associations, and improved power in the presence of genetic
		associations. Under the same settings, standard linear
		regression variously failed to control the type I error in the
		absence of associations, and was underpowered in the presence
		of associations.
