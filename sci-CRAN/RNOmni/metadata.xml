		Omnibus Test for Genetic Association Analysis using the Rank
		Normal Transformation // Implementation of genetic association
		tests that utilize the rank based inverse normal transformation
		(INT). The primary contribution is an omnibus test, which
		synthesizes two INT-based approaches, termed direct INT (DINT)
		and partially indirect INT (PIINT). In genome scale
		simulations, the omnibus test routinely provided valid
		inference against continuous phenotypes with skewed and heavy
		tailed residual distributions. Association testing against
		these same phenotypes via standard linear regression led to an
		excess of false positive associations. In addition to
		controlling the type I error, the omnibus approach provided
		power comparable to the more powerful of the component methods.
