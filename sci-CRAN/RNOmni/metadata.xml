		Omnibus Test for Genetic Association Analysis using the Rank
		Normal Transformation // Implementation of genetic association
		tests based on the rank based inverse normal transformation
		(INT). The primary contribution is an omnibus test, which
		synthesizes two complementary INT-based approaches. In
		simulations against phenotypes with skewed and heavy tailed
		residual distributions, the omnibus test provided valid
		inference in the absence of a genotypic effect, and provided
		power comparable to the more powerful of the component methods
		in the presence of a genotypic effect. Under these settings,
		standard linear regression often failed to control the type I
		error.
