		Rank Normal Transformation Omnibus Test // Implementation of
		genetic association tests that incorporate the rank-based
		inverse normal transformation (INT). These tests are broadly
		indicated for traits with continuous residual distributions. In
		the presence of non-normal residuals, INT-based tests robustly
		control the type I error, whereas standard linear regression
		may not. Moreover, INT-based tests dominate standard linear
		regression in terms of power. There are two main strategies for
		incorporating the INT in association analysis. In direct INT
		(D-INT), the trait is directly transformed. In indirect INT
		(I-INT), residuals are formed prior to transformation. Neither
		D-INT nor I-INT is uniformly most powerful. The INT omnibus
		test (O-INT) adaptively combines D-INT and I-INT into a single
		robust and statistically powerful approach.
