		Omnibus Test for Genetic Association Analysis using the Rank
		Normal Transformation // Implementation of genetic association
		tests using the rank based inverse normal transformation (INT).
		The primary contribution is an omnibus test, which synthesizes
		two complementary INT-based approaches. In simulations against
		phenotypes with skewed and heavy tailed residuals, the omnibus
		test provided valid inference in the absence of genetic
		effects. When genetic effects were present, the omnibus test
		provided power comparable to the more efficient of the
		component methods. Under these settings, standard linear
		regression variously failed to control the type I error in the
		absence of genetic effects, and was underpowered in the
		presence of genetic effects.
