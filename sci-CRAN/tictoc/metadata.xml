		Functions for Timing R Scripts, as Well as Implementations of
		"Stack" and "StackList" Structures // Code execution timing
		functions 'tic' and 'toc' that can be nested. One can record
		all timings while a complex script is running, and examine the
		values later. It is also possible to instrument the timing
		calls with custom callbacks. In addition, this package provides
		class 'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class 'StackList',
		which is a stack implemented as a list, both of which support
		operations 'push', 'pop', 'first_element', 'last_element' and
		'clear'.
