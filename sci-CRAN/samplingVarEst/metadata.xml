		Sampling Variance Estimation // Functions to calculate some point
		estimators and estimating their variance under unequal
		probability sampling without replacement. Single and two stage
		sampling designs are considered. Some approximations for the
		second order inclusion probabilities are also available (sample
		and population based). A variety of Jackknife variance
		estimators are implemented. Almost every function is written in
		C (compiled) for faster results.
