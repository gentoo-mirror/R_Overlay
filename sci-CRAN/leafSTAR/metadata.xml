		Silhouette to Area Ratio of Tilted Surfaces // Implementation of
		trigonometric functions to calculate the exposure of flat,
		tilted surfaces, such as leaves and slopes, to direct solar
		radiation. It implements the equations in A.G. Escribano-
		Rocafort, A. Ventre-Lespiaucq, C. Granado-Yela, et al. (2014)
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12141 in a few user-friendly R functions.
		All functions handle data obtained with 'Ahmes' 1.0 for
		Android, as well as more traditional data sources (compass,
		protractor, inclinometer). The main function (star())
		calculates the potential exposure of flat, tilted surfaces to
		direct solar radiation (silhouette to area ratio, STAR). It is
		equivalent to the ratio of the leaf projected area to total
		leaf area, but instead of using area data it uses spatial
		position angles, such as pitch, roll and course, and
		information on the geographical coordinates, hour, and date.
		The package includes additional functions to recalculate STAR
		with custom settings of location and time, to calculate the
		tilt angle of a surface, and the minimum angle between two non-
		orthogonal planes.
