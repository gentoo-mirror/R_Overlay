		Easily Access US Census Bureau Survey and Geographic Data // The
		key function 'get_vintage_data()' returns a dataframe and is
		the window into the Census Bureau API requiring just a dataset
		name, vintage(year), and vector of variable names for survey
		estimates/percentages. Other functions assist in searching for
		available datasets, geographies, group/variable concepts of
		interest.  Also provided are functions to access and layer (via
		standard piping) displayable geometries for the US, states,
		counties, blocks/tracts, roads, landmarks, places, and bodies
		of water. Joining survey data with many of the geometry
		functions is built-in to produce choropleth maps.
