		Computerized Adaptive Testing and Decision Trees // Implements
		the Merged Tree-CAT method to generate Computerized Adaptive
		Tests (CATs) based on a decision tree. The tree growth is
		controlled by merging branches with similar trait distributions
		and estimations. This package has the necessary tools for
		creating CATs and estimate the subject's ability level. The
		Merged Tree-CAT method is an extension of the Tree-CAT method
		(see Delgado-Gmez et al., 2019 doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2018.09.052).
