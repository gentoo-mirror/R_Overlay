		Computerized Adaptive Testing and Decision Trees // Implements
		the Merged Tree-CAT method (Javier Rodriguez-Cuadrado et al.,
		2020, doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113066) to generate Computerized
		Adaptive Tests (CATs) based on a decision tree. The tree growth
		is controlled by merging branches with similar trait
		distributions and estimations. This package has the necessary
		tools for creating CATs and estimate the subject's ability
		level.
