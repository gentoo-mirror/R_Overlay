		Univariate and Multivariate Damped Random Walk Processes // We
		provide a toolbox to fit and simulate a univariate or
		multivariate damped random walk process that is also known as
		an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process or a continuous-time
		autoregressive model of the first order, i.e., CAR(1) or
		CARMA(1, 0). This process is suitable for analyzing univariate
		or multivariate time series data with irregularly-spaced
		observation times and heteroscedastic measurement errors. When
		it comes to the multivariate case, the number of data points
		(measurements/observations) available at each observation time
		does not need to be the same, and the length of each time
		series can vary. The number of time series data sets that can
		be modeled simultaneously is limited to ten in this version of
		the package. We use Kalman-filtering to evaluate the resulting
		likelihood function, which leads to a scalable and efficient
		computation in finding maximum likelihood estimates of the
		model parameters or in drawing their posterior samples. Please
		pay attention to loading the data if this package is used for
		astronomical data analyses; see the details in the manual. Also
		see Hu and Tak (2020) arXiv:2005.08049.
