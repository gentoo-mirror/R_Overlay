		A Suite of High-Performance Packages for Statistics and Data
		Manipulation // Easy installation, loading and management, of
		high-performance packages for statistical computing and data
		manipulation in R. The core 'fastverse' consists of 4 packages:
		'data.table', 'collapse', 'kit' and 'magrittr', that jointly
		only depend on 'Rcpp'. The 'fastverse' can be freely and
		permanently extended with additional packages, both globally or
		for individual projects. Separate package verses can also be
		created. Fast packages for many common tasks such as time
		series, dates and times, strings, spatial data, statistics,
		data serialization, larger-than-memory processing, and
		compilation of R code are listed in the README file:
		https://github.com/fastverse/fastverse#suggested-extensions.
