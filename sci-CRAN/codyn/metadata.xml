		Community Dynamics Metrics // Univariate and multivariate
		temporal and spatial diversity indices, rank abundance curves,
		and community stability measures. The functions implement
		measures that are either explicitly temporal and include the
		option to calculate them over multiple replicates, or spatial
		and include the option to calculate them over multiple time
		points. Functions fall into five categories: static diversity
		indices, temporal diversity indices, spatial diversity indices,
		rank abundance curves, and community stability measures. The
		diversity indices are temporal and spatial analogs to
		traditional diversity indices. Specifically, the package
		includes functions to calculate community richness, evenness
		and diversity at a given point in space and time. In addition,
		it contains functions to calculate species turnover, mean rank
		shifts, and lags in community similarity between two time
		points.
