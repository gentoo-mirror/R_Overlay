		Data-Driven Design of Targeted Gene Panels for Estimating
		Immunotherapy Biomarkers // Implementation of the methodology
		proposed in 'Data-driven design of targeted gene panels for
		estimating immunotherapy biomarkers', Bradley and Cannings
		(2021) arXiv:2102.04296. This package allows the user to fit
		generative models of mutation from an annotated mutation
		dataset, and then further to produce tunable linear estimators
		of exome-wide biomarkers. It also contains functions to
		simulate mutation annotated format (MAF) data, as well as to
		analyse the output and performance of models.
