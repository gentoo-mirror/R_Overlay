		Colony Formation Assay: Taking into Account Cellular Cooperation
		// Cellular cooperation compromises the plating efficiency-
		based analysis of clonogenic survival data. This tool provides
		functions that enable a robust analysis of colony formation
		assay (CFA) data in presence or absence of cellular
		cooperation. The implemented method has been described in Brix
		et al. (2020). (Brix, N., Samaga, D., Hennel, R. et al. "The
		clonogenic assay: robustness of plating efficiency-based
		analysis is strongly compromised by cellular cooperation."
		Radiat Oncol 15, 248 (2020). doi:10.1186/s13014-020-01697-y)
		Power regression for parameter estimation, calculation of
		survival fractions, uncertainty analysis and plotting functions
		are provided.
