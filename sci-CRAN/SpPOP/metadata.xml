		Generation of Spatial Population under Different Levels of
		Relationships among Variables // The developed package can be
		used to generate a spatial population for different levels of
		relationships among the dependent and auxiliary variables along
		with spatially varying model parameters. A spatial layout is
		designed as a [0,k-1]x[0,k-1] square region on which
		observations are collected at (k x k) lattice points with a
		unit distance between any two neighbouring points along the
		horizontal and vertical axes. For method details see Chao,
		Liu., Chuanhua, Wei. and Yunan, Su.
		(2018).doi:10.1080/10485252.2018.1499907. The generated spatial
		population can be utilized in Geographically Weighted
		Regression model based analysis for studying the spatially
		varying relationships among the variables. Furthermore, various
		statistical analysis can be performed on this spatially
		generated data.
