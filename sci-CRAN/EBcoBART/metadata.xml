		Co-Data Learning for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees //
		Estimate prior variable weights for Bayesian Additive
		Regression Trees (BART). These weights correspond to the
		probabilities of the variables being selected in the splitting
		rules of the sum-of-trees. Weights are estimated using
		empirical Bayes and external information on the explanatory
		variables (co-data). BART models are fitted using the 'dbarts'
		'R' package. See Goedhart and others (2023)
