		Interval Estimation of Linear Models with Heteroskedasticity //
		Calculates the interval estimates for the parameters of linear
		models with heteroscedastic regression using bootstrap - (Wild
		Bootstrap) and double bootstrap-t (Wild Bootstrap). It is also
		possible to calculate confidence intervals using the percentile
		bootstrap and percentile bootstrap double. The package can
		calculate consistent estimates of the covariance matrix of the
		parameters of linear regression models with heteroscedasticity
		of unknown form. The package also provides a function to
		consistently calculate the covariance matrix of the parameters
		of linear models with heteroscedasticity of unknown form. The
		bootstrap methods exported by the package are based on the
		master's thesis of the first author, available at https://raw.g
		ithubusercontent.com/prdm0/hcci/master/references/dissertacao_m
		estrado.pdf. The hcci package in previous versions was cited in
		the book VINOD, Hrishikesh D. Hands-on Intermediate
		Econometrics Using R: Templates for Learning Quantitative
		Methods and R Software. 2022, p. 441, ISBN 978-981-125-617-2
		(hardcover). The simple bootstrap schemes are based on the
		works of Cribari-Neto F and Lima M. G. (2009)
		doi:10.1080/00949650801935327, while the double bootstrap
		schemes for the parameters that index the linear models with
		heteroscedasticity of unknown form are based on the works of
		Beran (1987) doi:10.2307/2336685. The use of bootstrap for the
		calculation of interval estimates in regression models with
		heteroscedasticity of unknown form from a weighting of the
		residuals was proposed by Wu (1986) doi:10.1214/aos/1176350142.
		This bootstrap scheme is known as weighted or wild bootstrap.
