		Support Functions for Time Series Analysis Book // Contains the
		support functions for the Time Series Analysis book. We present
		a function to calculate MSE and MAE for inputs of actual and
		forecast values.  We also have the code for disaggregation as
		found in Wei and Stram (1990,
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1990.tb01799.x), and Hodgess and Wei
		(1996, "Temporal Disaggregation of Time Series").
