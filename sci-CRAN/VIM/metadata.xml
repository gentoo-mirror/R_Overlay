		Visualization and Imputation of Missing Values // This package
		introduces new tools for the visualization of missing and/or
		imputed values, which can be used for exploring the data and
		the structure of the missing and/or imputed values. Depending
		on this structure of the missing values, the corresponding
		methods may help to identify the mechanism generating the
		missing values and allows to explore the data including missing
		values. In addition, the quality of imputation can be visually
		explored using various univariate, bivariate, multiple and
		multivariate plot methods. A graphical user interface available
		in the separate package VIMGUI allows an easy handling of the
		implemented plot methods.
