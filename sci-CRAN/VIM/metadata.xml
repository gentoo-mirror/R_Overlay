		Visualization and Imputation of Missing Values // New tools for
		the visualization of missing and/or imputed values are
		introduced, which can be used for exploring the data and the
		structure of the missing and/or imputed values. Depending on
		this structure of the missing values, the corresponding methods
		may help to identify the mechanism generating the missing
		values and allows to explore the data including missing values.
		In addition, the quality of imputation can be visually explored
		using various univariate, bivariate, multiple and multivariate
		plot methods. A graphical user interface available in the
		separate package VIMGUI allows an easy handling of the
		implemented plot methods.
