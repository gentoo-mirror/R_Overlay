		Ranking of Alternatives with the RAFSI Method // Ranking of
		Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-
		intervals into a Single Interval Method is designed to perform
		multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), developed by Malia iovic
		in 2020 (doi:10.3390/math8061015). It calculates the final
		sorted rankings based on a decision matrix where rows represent
		alternatives and columns represent criteria. The method uses: -
		A numeric vector of weights for each criterion (the sum of
		weights must be 1). - A numeric vector of ideal values for each
		criterion. - A numeric vector of anti-ideal values for each
		criterion. - Numeric values representing the extent to which
		the ideal value is preferred over the anti-ideal value, and the
		extent to which the anti-ideal value is considered worse. The
		function standardizes the decision matrix, normalizes the data,
		applies weights, and returns the final sorted rankings.
