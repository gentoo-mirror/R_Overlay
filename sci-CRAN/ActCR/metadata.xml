		Extract Circadian Rhythms Metrics from Actigraphy Data //
		Circadian rhythms are rhythms that oscillate about every 24 h,
		which has been observed in multiple physiological processes
		including core body temperature, hormone secretion, heart rate,
		blood pressure, and many others. Measuring circadian rhythm
		with wearables is based on a principle that there is increased
		movement during wake periods and reduced movement during sleep
		periods, and has been shown to be reliable and valid. This
		package can be used to extract nonparametric circadian metrics
		like intradaily variability (IV), interdaily stability (IS),
		and relative amplitude (RA); and parametric cosinor model
		coefficient. Details can be found in Junrui Di et al (2019)
