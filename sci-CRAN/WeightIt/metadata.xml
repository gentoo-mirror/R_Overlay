		Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies //
		Generates weights to form equivalent groups in observational
		studies by easing and extending the functionality of the R
		packages 'twang' (Ridgeway et al., 2017)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=twang for generalized
		boosted modeling, 'CBPS' (Fong, Ratkovic,  Imai, 2017)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CBPS for covariate balancing
		propensity score weighting, 'ebal' (Hainbueller, 2014)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ebal for entropy balancing,
		and 'ATE' (Haris  Chan, 2015)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ATE for empirical balancing
		calibration weighting. Also allows for assessment of weights
		and checking of covariate balance by interfacing directly with
		'cobalt' (Greifer, 2017)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cobalt.
