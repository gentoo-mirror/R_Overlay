		Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies //
		Generates balancing weights for causal effect estimation in
		observational studies with binary, multi-category, or
		continuous point or longitudinal treatments by easing and
		extending the functionality of several R packages and providing
		in-house estimation methods. Available methods include those
		that rely on parameteric modeling, optimization, and machine
		learning. Also allows for assessment of weights and checking of
		covariate balance by interfacing directly with the 'cobalt'
		package. Methods for estimating weighted regression models that
		take into account uncertainty in the estimation of the weights
		via M-estimation or bootstrapping are available. See the
		vignette "Installing Supporting Packages" for instructions on
		how to install any package 'WeightIt' uses, including those
		that may not be on CRAN.
