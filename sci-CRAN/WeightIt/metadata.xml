		Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies //
		Generates weights to form equivalent groups in observational
		studies by easing and extending the functionality of the R
		packages 'twang' (Ridgeway et al., 2017)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=twang for generalized
		boosted modeling, 'CBPS' (Fong, Ratkovic,  Imai, 2018)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CBPS for covariate balancing
		propensity score weighting, 'ebal' (Hainmueller, 2014)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ebal for entropy balancing,
		'optweight' (Greifer, 2018)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optweight for optimization-
		based weights, 'ATE' (Haris  Chan, 2015)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ATE for empirical balancing
		calibration weighting, and SuperLearner (Polley, LeDell,
		Kenney,  van der Laan, 2018)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SuperLearner. Also allows
		for assessment of weights and checking of covariate balance by
		interfacing directly with 'cobalt' (Greifer, 2018)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cobalt.
