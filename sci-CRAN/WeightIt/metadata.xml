		Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies //
		Generates balancing weights for causal effect estimation in
		observational studies with binary, multi-category, or
		continuous point or longitudinal treatments by easing and
		extending the functionality of several R packages and providing
		in-house estimation methods. Available methods include
		propensity score weighting using generalized linear models,
		gradient boosting machines, the covariate balancing propensity
		score algorithm, Bayesian additive regression trees, and
		SuperLearner, and directly estimating balancing weights using
		entropy balancing, empirical balancing calibration weights,
		energy balancing, and optimization-based weights. Also allows
		for assessment of weights and checking of covariate balance by
		interfacing directly with the 'cobalt' package. See the
		vignette "Installing Supporting Packages" for instructions on
		how to install any package 'WeightIt' uses, including those
		that may not be on CRAN.
