		Power Analysis of Flexible ANOVA Designs and Related Tests //
		Provides functions for conducting power analysis in ANOVA
		designs, including between-, within-, and mixed-factor designs,
		with full support for both main effects and interactions. The
		package allows calculation of statistical power, required total
		sample size, significance level, and minimal detectable effect
		sizes expressed as partial eta squared or Cohen's f for ANOVA
		terms and planned contrasts. In addition, complementary
		functions are included for common related tests such as t-tests
		and correlation tests, making the package a convenient toolkit
		for power analysis in experimental psychology and related
		fields.
