		Foundations Toolkit and Datasets for Data Science // Provides a
		collection of helper functions and illustrative datasets to
		support learning and teaching of data science with R. The
		package is designed as a companion to the book https://book-
		data-science-r.netlify.app, making key data science techniques
		accessible to individuals with minimal coding experience.
		Functions include tools for data partitioning, performance
		evaluation, and data transformations (e.g., z-score and min-max
		scaling). The included datasets are curated to highlight
		practical applications in data exploration, modeling, and
		multivariate analysis. An early inspiration for the package
		came from an ancient Persian idiom about "eating the liver,"
		symbolizing deep and immersive engagement with knowledge.
