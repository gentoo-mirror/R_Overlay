		"Eating the Liver of Data Science" // Provides a collection of
		helper functions that make various techniques from data science
		more user-friendly for non-experts. In this way, our aim is to
		allow non-experts to become familiar with the techniques with
		only a minimal level of coding knowledge. Indeed, following an
		ancient Persian idiom, we refer to this as "eating the liver of
		data science" which could be interpreted as "getting intimately
		close with data science". Examples of procedures we include
		are: data partitioning for out-of-sample testing, computing
		Mean Squared Error (MSE) for quantifying prediction accuracy,
		and data transformation (z-score and min-max). Besides such
		helper functions, the package also includes several interesting
		datasets that are useful for multivariate analysis.
