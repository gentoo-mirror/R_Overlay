		"Eating the Liver of Data Science" // Offers a suite of helper
		functions to simplify various data science techniques for non-
		experts. This package aims to enable individuals with only a
		minimal level of coding knowledge to become acquainted with
		these techniques in an accessible manner. Inspired by an
		ancient Persian idiom, we liken this process to "eating the
		liver of data science," suggesting a deep and intimate
		engagement with the field of data science. This package
		includes functions for tasks such as data partitioning for out-
		of-sample testing, calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) to
		assess prediction accuracy, and data transformations (z-score
		and min-max). In addition to these helper functions, the
		'liver' package also features several intriguing datasets
		valuable for multivariate analysis.
