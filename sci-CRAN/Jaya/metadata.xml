		Gradient-Free Optimization Algorithm for Single and Multi-
		Objective Problems // An implementation of the Jaya
		optimization algorithm for both single-objective and multi-
		objective problems. Jaya is a population-based, gradient-free
		optimization algorithm capable of solving constrained and
		unconstrained optimization problems without hyperparameters.
		This package includes features such as multi-objective Pareto
		optimization, adaptive population adjustment, and early
		stopping. For further details, see R.V. Rao (2016)
