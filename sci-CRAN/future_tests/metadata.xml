		Test Suite for 'Future API' Backends // Backends implementing the
		'Future' API, as defined by the 'future' package, should use
		the tests provided by this package to validate that they meet
		the minimal requirements of the 'Future' API.  The tests can be
		performed easily from within R or from outside of R from the
		command line making it easy to include them package tests and
		in Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines.
