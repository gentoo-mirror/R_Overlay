		Noisy Stochastic Block Model for GGM Inference // Greedy Bayesian
		algorithm to fit the noisy stochastic block model to an
		observed sparse graph. Moreover, a graph inference procedure to
		recover Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) from real data. This
		procedure comes with a control of the false discovery rate. The
		method is described in the article "Enhancing the Power of
		Gaussian Graphical Model Inference by Modeling the Graph
		Structure" by Kilian, Rebafka, and Villers (2024)
		arXiv:2402.19021.
