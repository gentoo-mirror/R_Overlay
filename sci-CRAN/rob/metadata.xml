		Run Orders with Assignment-Expansion Method // It enables the
		identification of sequentialexperimentation orders for
		factorial designs that jointly reduce bias and the number of
		level changes. The method used is that presented by Conto et
		al. (2025), known as the Assignment-Expansion method, which
		consists of adapting the linear programming assignment problem
		to generate balanced experimentation orders. The properties
		identified are then generalized to designs with a larger number
		of factors and levels using the expansion method proposed by
		Correa et al. (2009) and later generalized by Bhowmik et al.
		(2017). For more details see Conto et al. (2025)
