		Handles Missing Dates and Data and Converts into Weekly and
		Monthly from Daily // Many times, you will not find data for
		all dates. After first January, 2011 you may have next data on
		20th January, 2011 and so on. Also available dates may have
		zero values. Try to gather all such kinds of data in different
		excel sheets of a single excel file. Every sheet will contain
		two columns (1st one is dates and second one is the data).
		After loading all the sheets into different elements of a list,
		using this you can fill the gaps for all the sheets and mark
		all the corresponding values as zeros. Here I am talking about
		daily data. Finally, it will combine all the filled results
		into one data frame (first column is date and other columns
		will be corresponding values of your sheets) and give one
		combined data frame. Number of columns in the data frame will
		be number of sheets plus one. Then imputation will be done.
		Daily to monthly and weekly conversion is also possible.  More
		details can be found in Garai and others (2023)
