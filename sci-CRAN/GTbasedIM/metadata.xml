		Game Theory-Based Influence Measures // Understanding how
		features influence a specific response variable becomes crucial
		in classification problems, with applications ranging from
		medical diagnosis to customer behavior analysis. This packages
		provides tools to compute such an influence measure grounded on
		game theory concepts. In particular, the influence measures
		presented in Davila-Pena, Saavedra-Nieves, and Casas-Mndez
		(2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2408.02481 can be obtained.
