		Maximum Penalized Likelihood Estimation with Extended Lasso
		Penalty // Estimates coefficients of extended LASSO penalized
		linear regression and generalized linear models. Currently
		lasso and elastic net penalized linear regression and
		generalized linear models are considered. This package
		currently utilizes an accurate approximation of L1 penalty and
		then a modified Jacobi algorithm to estimate the coefficients.
		There is provision for plotting of the solutions and
		predictions of coefficients at given values of lambda. This
		package also contains functions for cross validation to select
		a suitable lambda value given the data. Also provides a
		function for estimation in fused lasso penalized linear
		regression. For more details, see Mandal, B. N.(2014).

		unpublished report submitted to Macquarie University, NSW,
		Australia.
