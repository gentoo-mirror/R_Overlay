		Molecular Acquisition, Cleaning, and Evaluation in R 'MACER' //
		To assist biological researchers in assembling taxonomically
		and marker focused molecular sequence data sets. 'MACER'
		accepts a list of genera as a user input and uses NCBI-GenBank
		and BOLD as resources to download and assemble molecular
		sequence datasets. These datasets are then assembled by marker,
		aligned, trimmed, and cleaned. The use of this package allows
		the publication of specific parameters to ensure
		reproducibility. The 'MACER' package has four core functions
		and an example run through using all of these functions can be
		found in the associated repository
		https://github.com/rgyoung6/MACER_example.
