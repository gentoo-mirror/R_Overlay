		Methods for Calculating 'KHQ' Scores and 'KHQ5D' Utility Index
		Scores // The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is a disease-
		specific, self-administered questionnaire designed specific to
		assess the impact of Urinary Incontinence (UI) on Quality of
		Life. The questionnaire was developed by Kelleher and
		collaborators (1997) doi:10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11006.x. It
		is a simple, acceptable and reliable measure to use in the
		clinical setting and a research tool that is useful in
		evaluating UI treatment outcomes. The KHQ five dimensions
		(KHQ5D) is a condition-specific preference-based measure
		developed by Brazier and collaborators (2008)
		doi:10.1177/0272989X07301820. Although not as popular as the
		SF6D doi:10.1016/S0895-4356(98)00103-6 and EQ-5D
		https://euroqol.org/, the KHQ5D measures health-related quality
		of life (HRQoL) specifically for UI, not general conditions
		like the others two instruments mentioned. The KHQ5D ca be used
		in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care. The
		subject self-rates their health in terms of five dimensions:
		Role Limitation (RL), Physical Limitations (PL), Social
		Limitations (SL), Emotions (E), and Sleep (S). Frequently the
		states on these five dimensions are converted to a single
		utility index using country specific value sets, which can be
		used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as
		well as in population health surveys. This package provides
		methods to calculate scores for each dimension of the KHQ;
		converts KHQ item scores to KHQ5D scores; and also calculates
		the utility index of the KHQ5D.
