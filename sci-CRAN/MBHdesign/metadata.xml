		Spatial Designs for Ecological and Environmental Surveys //
		Provides spatially balanced designs from a set of (contiguous)
		potential sampling locations in a study region for point-based
		and for transect-based surveys. Accommodates, without
		detrimental effects on spatial balance, sites that the
		researcher wishes to include in the survey for reasons other
		than the current randomisation (legacy sites).
