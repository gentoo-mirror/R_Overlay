		Continuous Confidence Interval Plots using t-Distribution //
		Provides an extension to 'ggplot2' (Wickham, 2016,
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4) for creating two types of
		continuous confidence interval plots (Violin CI and Gradient CI
		plots), typically for the sample mean. These plots contain
		multiple user-defined confidence areas with varying colours,
		defined by the underlying t-distribution used to compute
		standard confidence intervals for the mean of the normal
		distribution when the variance is unknown. Two types of plots
		are available, a gradient plot with rectangular areas, and a
		violin plot where the shape (horizontal width) is defined by
		the probability density function of the t-distribution.
