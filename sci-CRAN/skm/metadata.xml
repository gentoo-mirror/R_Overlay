		Selective k-Means // Algorithms for solving selective k-means
		problem, which is defined as finding k rows in an m x n matrix
		such that the sum of each column minimal is minimized. In the
		scenario when m == n and each cell value in matrix is a valid
		distance metric, this is equivalent to a k-means problem. The
		selective k-means extends the k-means problem in the sense that
		it is possible to have m != n, often the case m  n which
		implies the search is limited within a small subset of rows.
		Also, the selective k-means extends the k-means problem in the
		sense that the instance in row set can be instance not seen in
		the column set, e.g., select 2 from 3 internet service provider
		(row) for 5 houses (column) such that minimize the overall cost
		(cell value) - overall cost is the sum of the column minimal of
		the selected 2 service provider.
