		Flexible Clustering of Ordinal and Mixed-with-Ordinal Data //
		Extends the capabilities for flexible partitioning and model-
		based clustering available in the packages 'flexclust' and
		'flexmix' to handle ordinal and mixed-with-ordinal data types
		via new distance, centroid and driver functions that make
		various assumptions regarding ordinality. Using them within the
		flex-scheme allows for easy comparisons across methods.
