		Bayesian Cure Rate Modeling for Time-to-Event Data // A fully
		Bayesian approach in order to estimate a general family of cure
		rate models under the presence of covariates, see Papastamoulis
		and Milienos (2024) doi:10.1007/s11749-024-00942-w. The
		promotion time can be modelled (a) parametrically using typical
		distributional assumptions for time to event data (including
		the Weibull, Exponential, Gompertz, log-Logistic
		distributions), or (b) semiparametrically using finite mixtures
		of distributions. In both cases, user-defined families of
		distributions are allowed under some specific requirements.
		Posterior inference is carried out by constructing a
		Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler,
		which combines Gibbs sampling for the latent cure indicators
		and Metropolis-Hastings steps with Langevin diffusion dynamics
		for parameter updates. The main MCMC algorithm is embedded
		within a parallel tempering scheme by considering heated
		versions of the target posterior distribution.
