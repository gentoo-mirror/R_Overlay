		Generate Fully-Sequential Space-Filling Designs Inside a Unit
		Hypercube // Provides three methods proposed by Shang and Apley
		(2019) doi:10.1080/00224065.2019.1705207 to generate fully-
		sequential space-filling designs inside a unit hypercube. A
		'fully-sequential space-filling design' means a sequence of
		nested designs (as the design size varies from one point up to
		some maximum number of points) with the design points added one
		at a time and such that the design at each size has good space-
		filling properties. Two methods target the minimum pairwise
		distance criterion and generate maximin designs, among which
		one method is more efficient when design size is large. One
		method targets the maximum hole size criterion and uses a
		heuristic to generate what is closer to a minimax design.
