		Systematic Screening of Study Data for Subgroup Effects //
		Identifying outcome relevant subgroups has now become as simple
		as possible! The formerly lengthy and tedious search for the
		needle in a haystack will be replaced by a single,
		comprehensive and coherent presentation. The central result of
		a subgroup screening is a diagram in which each single dot
		stands for a subgroup. The diagram may show thousands of them.
		The position of the dot in the diagram is determined by the
		sample size of the subgroup and the statistical measure of the
		treatment effect in that subgroup. The sample size is shown on
		the horizontal axis while the treatment effect is displayed on
		the vertical axis. Furthermore, the diagram shows the line of
		no effect and the overall study results. For small subgroups,
		which are found on the left side of the plot, larger random
		deviations from the mean study effect are expected, while for
		larger subgroups only small deviations from the study mean can
		be expected to be chance findings. So for a study with no
		conspicuous subgroup effects, the dots in the figure are
		expected to form a kind of funnel. Any deviations from this
		funnel shape hint to conspicuous subgroups. This approach was
		presented in Muysers (2020) doi:10.1007/s43441-019-00082-6 and
		referenced in Ballarini (2020) doi:10.1002/pst.2012. New to
		version 3 is the Automatic Screening of one- or MUlti-factorial
		Subgroups (ASMUS) for documentation of the structured review of
		subgroup findings.
