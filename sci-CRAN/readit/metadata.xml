		Effortlessly Read Any Rectangular Data // Providing just one
		primary function, 'readit' uses a set of reasonable heuristics
		to apply the appropriate reader function to the given file
		path. As long as the data file has an extension, and the data
		is (or can be coerced to be) rectangular, readit() can probably
		read it.
