		Track Machine Learning Experiments // 'Guild AI' is an open-
		source tool for managing machine learning experiments. It's for
		scientists, engineers, and researchers who want to run scripts,
		compare results, measure progress, and automate machine
		learning workflow. 'Guild AI' is a light weight, external tool
		that runs locally. It works with any framework, doesn't require
		any changes to your code, or access to any web services. Users
		can easily record experiment metadata, track model changes,
		manage experiment artifacts, tune hyperparameters, and share
		results. 'Guild AI' combines features from 'Git', 'SQLite', and
		'Make' to provide a lab notebook for machine learning.
