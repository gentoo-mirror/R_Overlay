		Bayesian Optimal Phase II Design with Futility and Efficacy
		Stopping Boundaries // Bayesian optimal design with futility
		and efficacy stopping boundaries (BOP2-FE) is a novel
		statistical framework for single-arm Phase II clinical trials.
		It enables early termination for efficacy when interim data are
		promising, while explicitly controlling Type I and Type II
		error rates. The design supports a variety of endpoint
		structures, including single binary endpoints, nested
		endpoints, co-primary endpoints, and joint monitoring of
		efficacy and toxicity. The package provides tools for
		enumerating stopping boundaries prior to trial initiation and
		for conducting simulation studies to evaluate the designs
		operating characteristics. Users can flexibly specify design
		parameters to suit their specific applications. For
		methodological details, refer to Xu et al. (2025)
