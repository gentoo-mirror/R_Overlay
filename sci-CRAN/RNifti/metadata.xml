		Fast R and C++ Access to NIfTI Images // Provides very fast read
		and write access to images stored in the NIfTI-1, NIfTI-2 and
		ANALYZE-7.5 formats, with seamless synchronisation of in-memory
		image objects between compiled C and interpreted R code. Also
		provides a simple image viewer, and a C/C++ API that can be
		used by other packages. Not to be confused with 'RNiftyReg',
		which performs image registration and applies spatial
		transformations.
