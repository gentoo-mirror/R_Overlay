		Fast R and C++ Access to NIfTI Images // Provides very fast read
		and write access to images stored in the NIfTI-1 and
		ANALYZE-7.5 formats, with seamless synchronisation between
		compiled C and interpreted R code. Also provides a simple image
		viewer, and a C/C++ API that can be used by other packages. Not
		to be confused with 'RNiftyReg', which performs image
		registration.
