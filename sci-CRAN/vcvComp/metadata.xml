		Comparison of Variance - Covariance Patterns // Comparison of
		variance - covariance patterns using relative principal
		component analysis (relative eigenanalysis), as described in Le
		Maitre and Mitteroecker (2019) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13253.
		Also provides functions to compute group covariance matrices,
		distance matrices, and perform proportionality tests. A worked
		sample on the body shape of cichlid fishes is included, based
		on the dataset from Kerschbaumer et al. (2013)
