		Small Area Estimation using Fay-Herriot Models with Additive
		Logistic Transformation // Implements Additive Logistic
		Transformation (alr) for Small Area Estimation under Fay
		Herriot Model. Small Area Estimation is used to borrow strength
		from auxiliary variables to improve the effectiveness of a
		domain sample size. This package uses Empirical Best Linear
		Unbiased Prediction (EBLUP) estimator. The Additive Logistic
		Transformation (alr) are based on transformation by Aitchison J
		(1986). The covariance matrix for multivariate application is
		base on covariance matrix used by Esteban M, Lombarda M, Lpez-
		Vizcano E, Morales D, and Prez A
		doi:10.1007/s11749-019-00688-w. The non-sampled models are
		modified area-level models based on models proposed by Anisa R,
		Kurnia A, and Indahwati I doi:10.9790/5728-10121519, with
		univariate model using model-3, and multivariate model using
		model-1. The MSE are estimated using Parametric Bootstrap
		approach. For non-sampled cases, MSE are estimated using
		modified approach proposed by Haris F and Ubaidillah A
