		Omics Data Process Toolbox // Processing and analyzing omics data
		from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics
		platforms. It provides functions for preprocessing,
		normalization, visualization, and statistical analysis, as well
		as machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
		'omicsTools' is an essential tool for researchers working with
		high-throughput omics data in fields such as biology,
		bioinformatics, and medicine.The QC-RLSC (quality controlbased
		robust LOESS signal correction) algorithm is used for
		normalization. Dunn et al. (2011) doi:10.1038/nprot.2011.335.
