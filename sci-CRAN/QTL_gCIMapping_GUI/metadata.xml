		QTL Genome-Wide Composite Interval Mapping with Graphical User
		Interface // Conduct multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL)
		mapping under the framework of random-QTL-effect linear mixed
		model. First, each position on the genome is detected in order
		to obtain a negative logarithm P-value curve against genome
		position. Then, all the peaks on each effect (additive or
		dominant) curve are viewed as potential QTL, all the effects of
		the potential QTL are included in a multi-QTL model, their
		effects are estimated by empirical Bayes in doubled haploid
		population or by adaptive lasso in F2 population, and true QTL
		are identified by likelihood radio test. See Wen et al. (2018)
