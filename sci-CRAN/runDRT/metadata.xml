		Run Doubly Ranked Tests // Doubly ranked tests are nonparametric
		tests for grouped functional and multivariate data. The testing
		procedure first ranks a matrix (or three dimensional array) of
		data by column (if a matrix) or by cell (across the third
		dimension if an array). By default, it calculates a sufficient
		statistic for the subject's order within the sample using the
		observed ranks, taken over the columns or cells. Depending on
		the number of groups, G, the summarized ranks are then analyzed
		using either a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (G = 2) or a Kruskal-
		Wallis (G greater than 2).
