		Bayesian Multivariate Analysis of Summary Statistics //
		Multivariate tool for analyzing genome-wide association study
		results in the form of univariate summary statistics. The goal
		of 'bmass' is to comprehensively test all possible multivariate
		models given the phenotypes and datasets provided. Multivariate
		models are determined by assigning each phenotype to being
		either Unassociated (U), Directly associated (D) or Indirectly
		associated (I) with the genetic variant of interest. Test
		results for each model are presented in the form of Bayes
		factors, thereby allowing direct comparisons between models.
		The underlying framework implemented here is based on the
		modeling developed in "A Unified Framework for Association
		Analysis with Multiple Related Phenotypes", M. Stephens (2013)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0065245.
