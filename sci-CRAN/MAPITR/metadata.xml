		MArginal ePIstasis Test for Regions // A genetic analysis tool
		and variance component model for identifying marginal epistasis
		between pathways and the rest of the genome. 'MAPITR' uses as
		input a matrix of genotypes, a vector of phenotypes, and a list
		of pathways. 'MAPITR' then iteratively tests each pathway for
		epistasis between any variants within the pathway versus any
		variants remaining in the rest of the genome. 'MAPITR' returns
		results in the form of p-values for every pathway indicating
		whether the null model of there being no epistatic interactions
		between a pathway and the rest of the genome can be rejected.
