		Efficient Mixed-Level k-Circulant Supersaturated Designs //
		Generates efficient balanced mixed-level k-circulant
		supersaturated designs by interchanging the elements of the
		generator vector. Attempts to generate a supersaturated design
		that has EfNOD efficiency more than user specified efficiency
		level (mef). Displays the progress of generation of an
		efficient mixed-level k-circulant design through a progress
		bar. The progress of 100 per cent means that one full round of
		interchange is completed. More than one full round (typically
		4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger designs.
		For more details, please see Mandal, B.N., Gupta V. K. and
		Parsad, R. (2011). Construction of Efficient Mixed-Level
		k-Circulant Supersaturated Designs, Journal of Statistical
		Theory and Practice, 5:4, 627-648,
