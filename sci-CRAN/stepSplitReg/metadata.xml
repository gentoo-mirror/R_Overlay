		Stepwise Split Regularized Regression // Functions to perform
		stepwise split regularized regression. The approach first uses
		a stepwise algorithm to split the variables into the models
		with a goodness of fit criterion, and then regularization is
		applied to each model. The weights of the models in the
		ensemble are determined based on a criterion selected by the
		user.
