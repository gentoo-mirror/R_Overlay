		Penalized Multivariate Analysis // A modified version of PMA. The
		CCA() and CCA.permute() functions can also compute the
		component-wise standard deviations of estimated U and V through
		permutations in addition to standardize them. Furthermore, it
		computes the non-parametric p-values for each components.
		Performs Penalized Multivariate Analysis: a penalized matrix
		decomposition, sparse principal components analysis, and sparse
		canonical correlation analysis, described in Ali Mahzarnia,
		Alexander Badea (2022), "Joint Estimation of Vulnerable Brain
		Networks and Alzheimers Disease Risk Via Novel Extension of
		Sparse Canonical Correlation" at bioRxiv.
