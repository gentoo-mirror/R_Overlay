		United States Presidential State of the Union Addresses // The
		President of the United States is constitutionally obligated to
		provide a report known as the 'State of the Union'. The report
		summarizes the current challenges facing the country and the
		president's upcoming legislative agenda. While historically the
		State of the Union was often a written document, in recent
		decades it has always taken the form of an oral address to a
		joint session of the United States Congress. This package
		provides the raw text from every such address with the
		intention of being used for meaningful examples of text
		analysis in R. The corpus is well suited to the task as it is
		historically important, includes material intended to be read
		and material intended to be spoken, and it falls in the public
		domain. As the corpus spans over two centuries it is also a
		good test of how well various methods hold up to the
		idiosyncrasies of historical texts. Associated data about each
		address, such as the year, president, party, and format, are
		also included.
