		Drug Repurposing in Cancer via a Subpathway Crosstalk Network //
		A systematic biology tool was developed to repurpose drugs via
		a subpathway crosstalk network. The operation modes include 1)
		calculating centrality scores of SPs in the context of gene
		expression data to reflect the influence of SP crosstalk, 2)
		evaluating drug-disease reverse association based on disease-
		and drug-induced SPs weighted by the SP crosstalk, 3)
		identifying cancer candidate drugs through perturbation
		analysis. There are also several functions used to visualize
		the results.
