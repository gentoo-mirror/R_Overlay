		Convert Tibbles or Data Frames to Xts Easily // Facilitate the
		movement between data frames to 'xts'. Particularly useful when
		moving from 'tidyverse' to the widely used 'xts' package, which
		is the input format of choice to various other packages. It
		also allows the user to use a 'spread_by' argument for a
		character column 'xts' conversion.
