		Functions Ported from 'MMR2' Toolbox Offered in Kevin Dowd's Book
		Measuring Market Risk // 'Kevin Dowd's' book Measuring Market
		Risk is a widely read book in the area of risk measurement by
		students and practitioners alike. As he claims, 'MATLAB' indeed
		might have been the most suitable language when he originally
		wrote the functions, but, with growing popularity of R it is
		not entirely valid. As 'Dowd's' code was not intended to be
		error free and were mainly for reference, some functions in
		this package have inherited those errors. An attempt will be
		made in future releases to identify and correct them. 'Dowd's'
		original code can be downloaded from
		www.kevindowd.org/measuring-market-risk/. It should be noted
		that 'Dowd' offers both 'MMR2' and 'MMR1' toolboxes. Only
		'MMR2' was ported to R. 'MMR2' is more recent version of 'MMR1'
		toolbox and they both have mostly similar function. The toolbox
		mainly contains different parametric and non parametric methods
		for measurement of market risk as well as backtesting risk
		measurement methods.
