		Generate Color Tag Sequences // Implement a coherent and flexible
		protocol for animal color tagging. 'GenTag' provides a simple
		computational routine with low CPU usage to create color
		sequences for animal tag. First, a single-color tag sequence is
		created from an algorithm selected by the user, followed by
		verification of the combination uniqueness. Three methods to
		produce color tag sequences are provided. Users can modify the
		main function core to allow a wide range of applications.
