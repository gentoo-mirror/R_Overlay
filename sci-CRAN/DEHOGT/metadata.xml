		Differentially Expressed Heterogeneous Overdispersion Gene Test
		for Count Data // Implements a generalized linear model
		approach for detecting differentially expressed genes across
		treatment groups in count data. The package supports both
		quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to handle over-
		dispersion, ensuring robust identification of differential
		expression. It allows for the inclusion of treatment effects
		and gene-wise covariates, as well as normalization factors for
		accurate scaling across samples. Additionally, it incorporates
		statistical significance testing with options for p-value
		adjustment and log2 fold range thresholds, making it suitable
		for RNA-seq analysis as described in by Xu et al., (2024)
