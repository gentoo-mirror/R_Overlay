		Wrap Around Time Series Graphics // Wrap-around Time Series
		(WATS) plots for interrupted time series designs with seasonal
		patterns. Longitudinal trajectories are shown in both Cartesian
		and polar coordinates. In many scenarios, a WATS plot more
		clearly shows the existence and effect size of of an
		intervention. This package accompanies "Graphical Data Analysis
		on the Circle: Wrap-Around Time Series Plots for (Interrupted)
		Time Series Designs" by Rodgers, Beasley,  Schuelke (2014)
