		Property-Based Testing // Hedgehog will eat all your bugs.
		'Hedgehog' is a property-based testing package in the spirit of
		'QuickCheck'. With 'Hedgehog', one can test properties of their
		programs against randomly generated input, providing far
		superior test coverage compared to unit testing. One of the key
		benefits of 'Hedgehog' is integrated shrinking of
		counterexamples, which allows one to quickly find the cause of
		bugs, given salient examples when incorrect behaviour occurs.
