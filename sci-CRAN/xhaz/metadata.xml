		Excess Hazard Modelling Considering Inappropriate Mortality Rates
		// Fits relative survival regression models with or without
		proportional excess hazards and with the additional possibility
		to correct for background mortality by one or more
		parameter(s). These models are relevant when the observed
		mortality in the studied group is not comparable to that of the
		general population or in population-based studies where the
		available life tables used for net survival estimation are
		insufficiently stratified. In the latter case, the proposed
		model by Touraine et al. (2020) doi:10.1177/0962280218823234
		can be used. The user can also fit a model that relax the
		proportional expected hazards assumption considered in the
		Touraine et al. excess hazard model. This extension was
		proposed by Mba et al. (2020) doi:10.1186/s12874-020-01139-z to
		allow non-proportional effects of the additional variable on
		the general population mortality. In non-population-based
		studies, researchers can identify non-comparability source of
		bias in terms of expected mortality of selected individuals. A
		proposed excess hazard model correcting this selection bias is
		presented in Goungounga et al. (2019)
