		Change-in-Slope OP Algorithm with a Finite Number of States //
		Optimal partitioning algorithm for change-in-slope problem with
		continuity constraint and a finite number of states. Some
		constraints can be enforced in the inference: isotonic,
		unimodal or smoothing. With the function slopeSN() (segment
		neighborhood) the number of segments to infer is fixed by the
		user and does not depend on a penalty value.
