		Advanced Method Optimization for Spectra-Generating Sampling and
		Analysis Instrumentation // A graphical user interface to apply
		an advanced method optimization algorithm to various sampling
		and analysis instruments. This includes generating experimental
		designs, uploading and viewing data, and performing various
		analyses to determine the optimal method. Details of the
		techniques used in this package are published in Gamble,
		Granger,  Mannion (2024) doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c05763.
