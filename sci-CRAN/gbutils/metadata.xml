		Simulation of Real and Complex Numbers and Small Programming
		Utilities // Simulate real and complex numbers from
		distributions of their magnitude and arguments. Optionally, the
		magnitudes and/or arguments may be fixed in almost arbitrary
		ways. Plot density and distribution functions with automatic
		selection of suitable regions.  Small programming utilities:
		check if an object is identical to NA, count positional
		arguments in a call, set intersection of more than two sets,
		check if an argument is unnamed.
