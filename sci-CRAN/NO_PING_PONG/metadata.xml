		Incorporating Previous Findings When Evaluating New Data //
		Functions for revealing what happens when effect size estimates
		from previous studies are taken into account when evaluating
		each new dataset in a study sequence. The analyses can be
		conducted for cumulative meta-analyses and for Bayesian data
		analyses. The package contains sample data for a wide selection
		of research topics. Jointly considering previous findings along
		with new data is more likely to result in correct conclusions
		than does the traditional practice of not incorporating
		previous findings, which often results in a back and forth
		ping-pong of conclusions when evaluating a sequence of studies.
