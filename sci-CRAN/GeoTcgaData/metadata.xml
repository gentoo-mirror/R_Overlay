		Processed a various types of data on GEO and TCGA // Gene
		Expression Omnibus(GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
		provide us with a wealth of data, such as RNA-seq, DNA
		Methylation, and Copy number variation data. It's easy to
		download data from TCGA using the gdc tool, but processing
		these data into a format suitable for bioinformatics analysis
		requires more work. This R package was developed to handle
		these data.
