		Least-Squares Means // Obtain least-squares means for many
		linear, generalized linear, and mixed models. Compute contrasts
		or linear functions of least-squares means, and comparisons of
		slopes. Plots and compact letter displays. Least-squares means
		were proposed in Harvey, W (1960) "Least-squares analysis of
		data with unequal subclass numbers", Tech Report ARS-20-8, USDA
		National Agricultural Library, and discussed further in Searle,
		Speed, and Milliken (1980) "Population marginal means in the
		linear model: An alternative to least squares means", The
		American Statistician 34(4), 216-221
		doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031. NOTE: Users are encouraged
		to switch to the 'emmeans' package, as 'lsmeans' will be
		archived in the not-too-distant future.
