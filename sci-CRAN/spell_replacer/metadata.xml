		Probabilistic Spelling Correction in a Character Vector //
		Automatically replaces "misspelled" words in a character vector
		based on their string distance from a list of words sorted by
		their frequency in a corpus. The default word list provided in
		the package comes from the Corpus of Contemporary American
		English. Uses the Jaro-Winkler distance metric for string
		similarity as implemented in van der Loo (2014)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2014-011. The word frequency data is derived
		from Davies (2008-) "The Corpus of Contemporary American
		English (COCA)" https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/.
