		Distance Sampling Detection Function and Abundance Estimation //
		A simple way of fitting detection functions to distance
		sampling data for both line and point transects. Adjustment
		term selection, left and right truncation as well as
		monotonicity constraints and binning are supported. Abundance
		and density estimates can also be calculated (via a Horvitz-
		Thompson-like estimator) if survey area information is
		provided. See Miller et al. (2019) doi:10.18637/jss.v089.i01
		for more information on methods and
		https://examples.distancesampling.org/ for example analyses.
