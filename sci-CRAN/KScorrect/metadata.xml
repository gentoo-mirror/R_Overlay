		Lilliefors-Corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness-of-Fit Tests //
		Implements the Lilliefors-corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for
		use in goodness-of-fit tests, suitable when population
		parameters are unknown and must be estimated by sample
		statistics. P-values are estimated by simulation. Can be used
		with a variety of continuous distributions, including normal,
		lognormal, univariate mixtures of normals, uniform, loguniform,
		exponential, gamma, and Weibull distributions. Functions to
		generate random numbers and calculate density, distribution,
		and quantile functions are provided for use with the log
		uniform and mixture distributions.
