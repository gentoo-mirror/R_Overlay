		A Natural Language Interface to 'ggplot2' // The 'ggplot2'
		package is the state-of-the-art toolbox for creating and
		formatting graphs. However, it is easy to forget how certain
		formatting commands are named and sometimes users find
		themselves asking: How do you rotate the x-axis labels again?
		Or how do you hide the legend...? This package allows users to
		issue natural language commands related to theme-related
		styling of plots (colors, font size and such), which then are
		translated into valid 'ggplot2' commands.
