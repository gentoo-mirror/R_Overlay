		Metrics for Assessing the Quality of Generated Text //
		Implementation of the BLEU-Score in 'C++' to evaluate the
		quality of generated text. The BLEU-Score, introduced by
		Papineni et al. (2002) doi:10.3115/1073083.1073135, is a metric
		for evaluating the quality of generated text. It is based on
		the n-gram overlap between the generated text and reference
		texts. Additionally, the package provides some smoothing
		methods as described in Chen and Cherry (2014)
		doi:10.3115/v1/W14-3346.
