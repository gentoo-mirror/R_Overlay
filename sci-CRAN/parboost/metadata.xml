		Distributed Model-Based Boosting // Distributed gradient boosting
		based on the mboost package. The parboost package is designed
		to scale up component-wise functional gradient boosting in a
		distributed memory environment by splitting the observations
		into disjoint subsets, or alternatively using bootstrap samples
		(bagging). Each cluster node then fits a boosting model to its
		subset of the data. These boosting models are combined in an
		ensemble, either with equal weights, or by fitting a
		(penalized) regression model on the predictions of the
		individual models on the complete data.
