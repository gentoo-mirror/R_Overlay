		Unified Algorithm for Non-convex Penalized Estimation for
		Generalized Linear Models // An efficient unified nonconvex
		penalized estimation algorithm for Gaussian (linear), binomial
		Logit (logistic), Poisson, multinomial Logit, and Cox
		proportional hazard regression models. The unified algorithm is
		implemented based on the convex concave procedure and the
		algorithm can be applied to most of the existing nonconvex
		penalties. The algorithm also supports convex penalty: least
		absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Supported
		nonconvex penalties include smoothly clipped absolute deviation
		(SCAD), minimax concave penalty (MCP), truncated LASSO penalty
		(TLP), clipped LASSO (CLASSO), sparse ridge (SRIDGE), modified
		bridge (MBRIDGE) and modified log (MLOG). For high-dimensional
		data (data set with many variables), the algorithm selects
		relevant variables producing a parsimonious regression model.
