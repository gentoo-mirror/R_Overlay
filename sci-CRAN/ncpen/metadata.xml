		Nonconvex Penalized Estimation for Generalized Linear Models //
		An efficient unified algorithm for estimating the nonconvex
		penalized linear, logistic and Poisson regression models. The
		unified algorithm is implemented based on the convex concave
		procedure and the algorithm can be applied to most of the
		existing nonconvex penalties. The algorithm also supports
		convex penalty: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
		(LASSO). Supported nonconvex penalties include smoothly clipped
		absolute deviation (SCAD), minimax concave penalty (MCP),
		truncated LASSO penalty (TLP), clipped LASSO (CLASSO), sparse
		ridge (SRIDGE), modified bridge (MBRIDGE) and modified log
		(MLOG). For a data set with many variables (high-dimensional
		data), the algorithm selects relevant variables producing a
		parsimonious regression model. Kwon, S., Lee, S. and Kim, Y.
