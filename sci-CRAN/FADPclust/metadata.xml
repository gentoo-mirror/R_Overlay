		Functional Data Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection
		// An implementation of a clustering algorithm for functional
		data based on adaptive density peak detection technique, in
		which the density is estimated by functional k-nearest neighbor
		density estimation based on a proposed semi-metric between
		functions. The proposed functional data clustering algorithm is
		computationally fast since it does not need iterative process.
