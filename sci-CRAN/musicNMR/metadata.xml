		Conversion of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra in Audio Files
		// A collection of functions for converting and visualization
		the free induction decay of mono dimensional nuclear magnetic
		resonance (NMR) spectra into an audio file. It facilitates the
		conversion of Bruker datasets in files WAV. The sound of NMR
		signals could provide an alternative to the current
		representation of the individual metabolic fingerprint and
		supply equally significant information. The package includes
		also NMR spectra of the urine samples provided by four healthy
		donors. Based on Cacciatore S, Saccenti E, Piccioli M.
		Hypothesis: the sound of the individual metabolic phenotype?
		Acoustic detection of NMR experiments. OMICS.
