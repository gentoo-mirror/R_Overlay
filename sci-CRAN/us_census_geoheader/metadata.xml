		US 2010 Census SF2 Geographic Header Summary Levels 010-050 // A
		simple interface to the Geographic Header information from the
		"2010 US Census Summary File 2".  The entire Summary File 2 is
		described at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/census-2000
		-summary-file-2-sf2, but note that this package only provides
		access to parts of the geographic header ('geoheader') of the
		file.  In particular, only the first 101 columns of the
		geoheader are included and, more importantly, only rows with
		summary levels (SUMLEVs) 010 through 050 (nation down through
		county level) are included.  In addition to access to (part of)
		the geoheader, the package also provides a decode function that
		takes a column name and value and, for certain columns, returns
		"the meaning" of that column (i.e., a "SUMLEV" value of 40
		means "State"); without a value, the decode function attempts
		to describe the column itself.
