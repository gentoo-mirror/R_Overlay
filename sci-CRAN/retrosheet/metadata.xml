		Import Professional Baseball Data from 'Retrosheet' // A
		collection of tools to import and structure the (currently)
		single-season event, game-log, roster, and schedule data
		available from https://www.retrosheet.org. In particular, the
		event (a.k.a. play-by-play) files can be especially difficult
		to parse. This package does the parsing on those files,
		returning the requested data in the most practical R structure
		to use for sabermetric or other analyses.
