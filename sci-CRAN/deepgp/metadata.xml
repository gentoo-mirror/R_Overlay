		Sequential Design for Deep Gaussian Processes using MCMC //
		Performs model fitting and sequential design for deep Gaussian
		processes following Sauer, Gramacy, and Higdon (2020)
		arXiv:2012.08015. Models extend up to three layers deep; a one
		layer model is equivalent to typical Gaussian process
		regression.  Covariance kernel options are Matern (default) and
		squared exponential.  Sequential design criteria include
		integrated mean-squared error (IMSE), active learning Cohn
		(ALC), and expected improvement (EI).  Applicable to both noisy
		and deterministic functions.  Incorporates SNOW parallelization
		and utilizes C and C++ under the hood.
