		Sequential Design for Deep Gaussian Processes using MCMC //
		Performs model fitting and sequential design for deep Gaussian
		processes using MCMC and elliptical slice sampling.  Models
		extend up to three layers deep; a one layer model is equivalent
		to typical Gaussian process regression.  Sequential design
		criteria include integrated mean square prediction error
		(IMSPE), active learning Cohn (ALC), and expected improvement
		(EI).  Covariance structure is based on inverse exponentiated
		squared euclidean distance.  Applicable to noisy and
		deterministic functions. Incorporates SNOW parallelization and
		utilizes C under the hood.  Manuscript forthcoming; see
		Damianou and Lawrence (2013) arXiv:1211.0358 for deep Gaussian
		process models and Murray, Adams, and MacKay (2010)
		arXiv:1001.0175 for elliptical slice sampling.
