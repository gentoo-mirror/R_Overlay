		Deep Gaussian Processes using MCMC // Performs posterior
		inference for deep Gaussian processes following Sauer, Gramacy,
		and Higdon (2020) arXiv:2012.08015.  Models are trained through
		MCMC including elliptical slice sampling of latent Gaussian
		layers and Metropolis-Hastings sampling of kernel
		hyperparameters.  Vecchia-approximation for faster computation
		is implemented following Sauer, Cooper, and Gramacy (2022)
		arXiv:2204.02904.  Downstream tasks include sequential design
		through active learning Cohn/integrated mean squared error
		(ALC/IMSE; Sauer, Gramacy, and Higdon, 2020) and optimization
		through expected improvement (EI; Gramacy, Sauer, and Wycoff,
		2021 arXiv:2112.07457).  Models extend up to three layers deep;
		a one layer model is equivalent to typical Gaussian process
		regression.  Covariance kernel options are matern (default) and
		squared exponential.  Incorporates OpenMP and SNOW
		parallelization and utilizes C/C++ under the hood.
