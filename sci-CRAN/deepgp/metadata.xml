		Bayesian Deep Gaussian Processes using MCMC // Performs Bayesian
		posterior inference for deep Gaussian processes following
		Sauer, Gramacy, and Higdon (2023, arXiv:2012.08015).  See Sauer
		(2023, http://hdl.handle.net/10919/114845) for comprehensive
		methodological details and
		https://bitbucket.org/gramacylab/deepgp-ex/ for a variety of
		coding examples. Models are trained through MCMC including
		elliptical slice sampling of latent Gaussian layers and
		Metropolis-Hastings sampling of kernel hyperparameters.
		Vecchia-approximation for faster computation is implemented
		following Sauer, Cooper, and Gramacy (2022, arXiv:2204.02904).
		Downstream tasks include sequential design through active
		learning Cohn/integrated mean squared error (ALC/IMSE; Sauer,
		Gramacy, and Higdon, 2023), optimization through expected
		improvement (EI; Gramacy, Sauer, and Wycoff, 2021
		arXiv:2112.07457), and contour location through entropy (Sauer,
		2023).  Models extend up to three layers deep; a one layer
		model is equivalent to typical Gaussian process regression.
		Incorporates OpenMP and SNOW parallelization and utilizes C/C++
		under the hood.
