		Sequential Design for Deep Gaussian Processes using MCMC //
		Performs model fitting and sequential design for deep Gaussian
		processes following Sauer, Gramacy, and Higdon (2020)
		arXiv:2012.08015.  Models extend up to three layers deep; a one
		layer model is equivalent to typical Gaussian process
		regression.  Sequential design criteria include integrated
		mean-squared error (IMSE), active learning Cohn (ALC), and
		expected improvement (EI).  Covariance structure is based on
		inverse exponentiated squared euclidean distance.  Applicable
		to noisy and deterministic functions. Incorporates SNOW
		parallelization and utilizes C under the hood.
