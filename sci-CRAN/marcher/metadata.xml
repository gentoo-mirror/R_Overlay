		Migration and Range Change Estimation in R // A set of tools for
		likelihood-based estimation, model selection and testing of
		two- and three-range shift and migration models for animal
		movement data as described in Gurarie et al. (2017) doi:
		10.1111/1365-2656.12674.  Provided movement data (X, Y and
		Time), including irregularly sampled data, functions estimate
		the time, duration and location of one or two range shifts, as
		well as the ranging area and auto-correlation structure of the
		movment.  Tests assess, for example, whether the shift was
		"significant", and whether a two-shift migration was a true
		return migration.
