		Provides Test Functions for Multivariate Integration // Provides
		implementations of functions that can be used to test
		multivariate integration routines. The package covers five
		different integration domains (unit hypercube, unit ball, unit
		sphere, standard simplex and R^n). For each domain several
		functions with different properties (smooth, non-
		differentiable, ...) are available. The functions are available
		in all dimensions n = 1. For each function the exact value of
		the integral is known and implemented to allow testing the
		accuracy of multivariate integration routines. Details on the
		available test functions can be found at on the development
		website.
