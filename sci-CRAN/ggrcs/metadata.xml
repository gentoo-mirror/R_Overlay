		Draw Histograms and Restricted Cubic Splines (RCS) // You can use
		this function to easily draw a combined histogram and
		restricted cubic spline. The function draws the graph through
		'ggplot2'. RCS fitting requires the use of the rcs() function
		of the 'rms' package. Can fit cox regression, logistic
		regression. This method was described by Per Kragh (2003)
