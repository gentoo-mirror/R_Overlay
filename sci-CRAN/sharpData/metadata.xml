		Data Sharpening // Functions and data sets inspired by data
		sharpening - data perturbation to achieve improved performance
		in nonparametric estimation, as described in Choi, E., Hall, P.
		and Rousson, V. (2000) doi:10.1214/aos/1015957396. Capabilities
		for enhanced local linear regression function and derivative
		estimation are included, as well as an asymptotically correct
		iterated data sharpening estimator for any degree of local
		polynomial regression estimation. A cross-validation-based
		bandwidth selector is included which, in concert with the
		iterated sharpener, will often provide superior performance,
		according to a median integrated squared error criterion.
		Sample data sets are provided to illustrate function usage.
