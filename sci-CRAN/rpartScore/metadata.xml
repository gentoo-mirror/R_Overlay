		Classification Trees for Ordinal Responses // Recursive
		partitioning methods to build classification trees for ordinal
		responses within the CART framework. Trees are grown using the
		Generalized Gini impurity function, where the misclassification
		costs are given by the absolute or squared differences in
		scores assigned to the categories of the response. Pruning is
		based on the total misclassification rate or on the total
		misclassification cost.
