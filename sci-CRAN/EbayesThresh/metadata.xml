		Empirical Bayes Thresholding and Related Methods // Empirical
		Bayes thresholding using the methods developed by I. M.
		Johnstone and B. W. Silverman. The basic problem is to estimate
		a mean vector given a vector of observations of the mean vector
		plus white noise, taking advantage of possible sparsity in the
		mean vector. Within a Bayesian formulation, the elements of the
		mean vector are modelled as having, independently, a
		distribution that is a mixture of an atom of probability at
		zero and a suitable heavy-tailed distribution. The mixing
		parameter can be estimated by a marginal maximum likelihood
		approach. This leads to an adaptive thresholding approach on
		the original data. Extensions of the basic method, in
		particular to wavelet thresholding, are also implemented within
		the package.
