		Stratified Analysis of 2x2 Contingency Tables // Offers a
		comprehensive approach for analysing stratified 2x2 contingency
		tables. It facilitates the calculation of odds ratios, 95%
		confidence intervals, and conducts chi-squared, Cochran-Mantel-
		Haenszel, Mantel-Haenszel, and Breslow-Day-Tarone tests. The
		package is particularly useful in fields like epidemiology and
		social sciences where stratified analysis is essential. The
		package also provides interpretative insights into the results,
		aiding in the understanding of statistical outcomes.
