		Access the U.S. Census Bureau Geocoder // Provides access to the
		U.S. Census Bureau's API for batch geocoding American street
		addresses (https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder). The
		package offers a batch solution for address geocoding, as
		opposed to geocoding a single address at a time. It has also
		been developed specifically with large data sets in mind - only
		unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data
		set exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically
		subset into appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then
		put back together so that a single object is returned.
