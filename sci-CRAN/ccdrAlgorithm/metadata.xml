		CCDr Algorithm for Learning Sparse Gaussian Bayesian Networks //
		Implementation of the CCDr (Concave penalized Coordinate
		Descent with reparametrization) structure learning algorithm as
		described in Aragam and Zhou (2015)
		https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/aragam15a.html. This is a fast,
		score-based method for learning Bayesian networks that uses
		sparse regularization and block-cyclic coordinate descent.
