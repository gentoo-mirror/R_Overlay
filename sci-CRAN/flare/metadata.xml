		Family of Lasso Regression // Provide the implementation of a
		family of Lasso variants including Dantzig Selector, LAD Lasso,
		SQRT Lasso, Lq Lasso for estimating high dimensional sparse
		linear model. We adopt the alternating direction method of
		multipliers and convert the original optimization problem into
		a sequential L1 penalized least square minimization problem,
		which can be efficiently solved by linearization algorithm. A
		multi-stage screening approach is adopted for further
		acceleration. Besides the sparse linear model estimation, we
		also provide the extension of these Lasso variants to sparse
		Gaussian graphical model estimation including TIGER and CLIME
		using either L1 or adaptive penalty. Missing values can be
		tolerated for Dantzig selector and CLIME. The computation is
		memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. For more
		information, please refer to
