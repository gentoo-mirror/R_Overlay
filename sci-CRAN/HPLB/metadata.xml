		High-Probability Lower Bounds for the Total Variance Distance //
		An implementation of high-probability lower bounds for the
		total variance distance as introduced in Michel  Naef
		Meinshausen (2020) arXiv:2005.06006. An estimated lower-bound
		(with high-probability) on the total variation distance between
		two probability distributions from which samples are observed
		can be obtained with the function HPLB.
