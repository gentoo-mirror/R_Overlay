		Teaching Data for Statistics and Data Science // Provides data
		sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. It
		includes a sample of data from John Edmund Kerrich's famous
		coinflip experiment. These are data that I used for statistics.
		The package also contains an R Markdown template with the
		required formatting for assignments in my former courses.
