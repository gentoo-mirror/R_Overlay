		Teaching Data for Statistics and Data Science // Provides data
		sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. It
		includes a sample of data from John Edmund Kerrich's famous
		coinflip experiment. These are data that I use for teaching SOC
		4015 / SOC 5050 at Saint Louis University (SLU). The package
		also contains an R Markdown template with the required
		formatting for assignments in my courses SOC 4015, SOC 4650,
		SOC 5050, and SOC 5650 at SLU.
