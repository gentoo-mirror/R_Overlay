		Partially Additive (Generalized) Linear Model Trees // This is an
		implementation of model-based trees with global model
		parameters (PALM trees). The PALM tree algorithm is an
		extension to the MOB algorithm (implemented in the 'partykit'
		package), where some parameters are fixed across all groups.
		Details about the method can be found in Seibold, Hothorn,
		Zeileis (2016) arXiv:1612.07498. The package offers coef(),
		logLik(), plot(), and predict() functions for PALM trees.
