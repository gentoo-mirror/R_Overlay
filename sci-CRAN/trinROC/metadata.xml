		Statistical Tests for Assessing Trinormal ROC Data // Several
		statistical test functions as well as a function for
		exploratory data analysis to investigate classifiers allocating
		individuals to one of three disjoint and ordered classes. In a
		single classifier assessment the discriminatory power is
		compared to classification by chance. In a comparison of two
		classifiers the null hypothesis corresponds to equal
		discriminatory power of the two classifiers. See also "ROC
		Analysis for Classification and Prediction in Practice" by
		Nakas, Bantis and Gatsonis (2023), ISBN 9781482233704.
