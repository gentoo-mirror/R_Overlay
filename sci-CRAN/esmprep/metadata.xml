		Data Preparation During and After the Use of the Experience
		Sampling Methodology (ESM) // Support in preparing a raw ESM
		dataset for statistical analysis. Preparation includes the
		handling of errors (mostly due to technological reasons) and
		the generating of new variables that are necessary and/or
		helpful in meeting the conditions when statistically analyzing
		ESM data. The functions in 'esmprep' are meant to
		hierarchically lead from bottom, i.e. the raw (separated) ESM
		dataset(s), to top, i.e. a single ESM dataset ready for
		statistical analysis. This hierarchy evolved out of my personal
		experience in working with ESM data.
