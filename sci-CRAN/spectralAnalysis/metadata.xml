		Pre-Process, Visualize and Analyse Process Analytical Data, by
		Spectral Data Measurements Made During a Chemical Process //
		Infrared, near-infrared and Raman spectroscopic data measured
		during chemical reactions, provide structural fingerprints by
		which molecules can be identified and quantified. The
		application of these spectroscopic techniques as inline process
		analytical tools (PAT), provides the (pharma-)chemical industry
		with novel tools, allowing to monitor their chemical processes,
		resulting in a better process understanding through insight in
		reaction rates, mechanistics, stability, etc. Data can be read
		into R via the generic spc-format, which is generally supported
		by spectrometer vendor software. Versatile pre-processing
		functions are available to perform baseline correction by
		linking to the 'baseline' package; noise reduction via the
		'signal' package; as well as time alignment, normalization,
		differentiation, integration and interpolation. Implementation
		based on the S4 object system allows storing a pre-processing
		pipeline as part of a spectral data object, and easily
		transferring it to other datasets. Interactive plotting tools
		are provided based on the 'plotly' package. Non-negative matrix
		factorization (NMF) has been implemented to perform
		multivariate analyses on individual spectral datasets or on
		multiple datasets at once. NMF provides a parts-based
		representation of the spectral data in terms of spectral
		signatures of the chemical compounds and their relative
		proportions. The functionality to read in spc-files was adapted
		from the 'hyperSpec' package.
