		Statistical Modeling // A collection of algorithms and functions
		to aid statistical modeling. Includes limiting dilution
		analysis (aka ELDA), growth curve comparisons, mixed linear
		models, heteroscedastic regression, inverse-Gaussian
		probability calculations, Gauss quadrature and a secure
		convergence algorithm for nonlinear models. Also includes
		advanced generalized linear model functions including Tweedie
		and Digamma distributional families and a secure convergence
		algorithm.
