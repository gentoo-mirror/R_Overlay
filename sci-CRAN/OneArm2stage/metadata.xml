		Phase II Single-Arm Two-Stage Designs with Time-to-Event Outcomes
		// Two-stage design for single-arm phase II trials with time-
		to-event endpoints (e.g., clinical trials on immunotherapies
		among cancer patients) can be calculated using this package.
		Two notable advantages of the package: 1) It provides flexible
		choices from three design methods (optimal, minmax, and
		admissible), and 2) the power of the design is more accurately
		calculated using the exact variance in the one-sample log-rank
		test. The package can be used for 1) planning the sample sizes
		and other design parameters, and 2) conducting the interim and
		final analyses for the Go/No-go decisions. More details about
		the design method can be found in: Wu, J, Chen L, Wei J, Weiss
		H, Chauhan A. (2020). doi:10.1002/pst.1983.
