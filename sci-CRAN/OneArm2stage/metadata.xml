		Optimal One-Arm Two-Stage Phase II Design with Survival Endpoint
		// The proposed two-stage design can be used for single-arm
		phase II trial designs with time-to-event endpoints, which is
		desirable for clinical trials on immunotherapies among cancer
		patients. There're two advantages of the proposed approach: 1)
		It provides flexible choices of four underlying survival
		distributions and 2) the power of the design is more accurately
		calculated using exact variance in one-sample log-rank test.
		The package can be used for 1) planning the sample size; 2)
		conducting the interim and final analyses for the Go/No-go
		decisions. More details about the design method can be found in
		the paper: Wu, J, Chen L, Wei J, Weiss H, Chauhan A. (2020).
