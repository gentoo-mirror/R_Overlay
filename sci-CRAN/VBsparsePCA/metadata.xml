		The Variational Bayesian Method for Sparse PCA // Contains
		functions for a variational Bayesian method for sparse PCA
		proposed by Ning (2020) arXiv:2102.00305. There are two
		algorithms: the PX-CAVI algorithm (if assuming the loadings
		matrix is jointly row-sparse) and the batch PX-CAVI algorithm
		(if without this assumption). The outputs of the main function,
		VBsparsePCA(), include the mean and covariance of the loadings
		matrix, the score functions, the variable selection results,
		and the estimated variance of the random noise.
