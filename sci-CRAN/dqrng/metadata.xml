		Fast Pseudo Random Number Generators // Several fast random
		number generators are provided as C++ header only libraries:
		The PCG family by O'Neill (2014 https://www.cs.hmc.edu/tr/hmc-
		cs-2014-0905.pdf) as well as Xoroshiro128+ and Xoshiro256+ by
		Blackman and Vigna (2018 arXiv:1805.01407). In addition fast
		functions for generating random numbers according to a uniform,
		normal and exponential distribution are included. The latter
		two use the Ziggurat algorithm originally proposed by Marsaglia
		and Tsang (2000, doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08). These functions
		are exported to R and as a C++ interface and are enabled for
		use with the default 64 bit generator from the PCG family,
		Xoroshiro128+ and Xoshiro256+ as well as the 64 bit version of
		the 20 rounds Threefry engine (Salmon et al., 2011
		doi:10.1145/2063384.2063405) as provided by the package
		'sitmo'.
