		Functionalities for the 'INLA' Package // Contain code to work
		with latent Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) models. Queries
		for the 'cgeneric' interface, specified as a way to implement
		new GMRF models to be fitted as model components in the 'INLA'
		package (https://www.r-inla.org). The implemented
		functionalities leverage the use of 'cgeneric' models and
		provide a way to debug the code as well to work with the prior
		for the model parameters and to sample from it. A Kronecker
		product method is also implemented to work with the four
		possible combinations between a 'cgeneric' and a 'rgeneric'
		model.
