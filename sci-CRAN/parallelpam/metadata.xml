		Parallel Partitioning-Around-Medoids (PAM) for Big Sets of Data
		// Application of the Partitioning-Around-Medoids (PAM)
		clustering algorithm described in Schubert, E. and Rousseeuw,
		P.J.: "Fast and eager k-medoids clustering: O(k) runtime
		improvement of the PAM, CLARA, and CLARANS algorithms."
		Information Systems, vol. 101, p. 101804, (2021).
		doi:10.1016/j.is.2021.101804. It uses a binary format for
		storing and retrieval of matrices developed for the 'jmatrix'
		package but the functionality of 'jmatrix' is included here, so
		you do not need to install it. Also, it is used by package
		'scellpam', so if you have installed it, you do not need to
		install this package. PAM can be applied to sets of data whose
		dissimilarity matrix can be very big. It has been tested with
		up to 100.000 points. It does this with the help of the code
		developed for other package, 'jmatrix', which allows the matrix
		not to be loaded in 'R' memory (which would force it to be of
		double type) but it gets from disk, which allows using float
		(or even smaller data types). Moreover, the dissimilarity
		matrix is calculated in parallel if the computer has several
		cores so it can open many threads. The initial part of the PAM
		algorithm can be done with the BUILD or LAB algorithms; the
		BUILD algorithm has been implemented in parallel. The
		optimization phase implements the FastPAM1 algorithm, also in
		parallel. Finally, calculation of silhouette is available and
		also implemented in parallel.
