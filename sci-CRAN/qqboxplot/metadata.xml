		Implementation of the Q-Q Boxplot // A system to implement the
		Q-Q boxplot.  It is implemented as an extension to 'ggplot2'.
		The Q-Q boxplot is an amalgam of the boxplot and the Q-Q plot
		and allows the user to rapidly examine summary statistics and
		tail behavior for multiple distributions in the same pane.  As
		an extension of the 'ggplot2' implementation of the boxplot,
		possible modifications to the boxplot extend to the Q-Q
		boxplot.
