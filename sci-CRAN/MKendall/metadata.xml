		Matrix Kendall's Tau and Matrix Elliptical Factor Model // Large-
		scale matrix-variate data have been widely observed nowadays in
		various research areas such as finance, signal processing and
		medical imaging. Modelling matrix-valued data by matrix-
		elliptical family not only provides a flexible way to handle
		heavy-tail property and tail dependencies, but also maintains
		the intrinsic row and column structure of random matrices. We
		proposed a new tool named matrix Kendall's tau which is
		efficient for analyzing random elliptical matrices. By applying
		this new type of Kendells tau to the matrix elliptical factor
		model, we propose a Matrix-type Robust Two-Step (MRTS) method
		to estimate the loading and factor spaces. See the details in
		He at al. (2022) arXiv:2207.09633. In this package, we provide
		the algorithms for calculating sample matrix Kendall's tau, the
		MRTS method and the Matrix Kendall's tau Eigenvalue-Ratio
		(MKER) method which is used for determining the number of
		factors.
