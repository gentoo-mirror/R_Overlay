		Variable Selection under Ranked Sparsity Principles for
		Interactions and Polynomials // An implementation of ranked
		sparsity methods, including penalized regression methods such
		as the sparsity-ranked lasso, its non-convex alternatives, and
		elastic net, as well as the sparsity-ranked Bayesian
		Information Criterion. As described in Peterson and Cavanaugh
		(2022) doi:10.1007/s10182-021-00431-7, ranked sparsity is a
		philosophy with methods primarily useful for variable selection
		in the presence of prior informational asymmetry, which occurs
		in the context of trying to perform variable selection in the
		presence of interactions and/or polynomials. Ultimately, this
		package attempts to facilitate dealing with cumbersome
		interactions and polynomials while not avoiding them entirely.
		Typically, models selected under ranked sparsity principles
		will also be more transparent, having fewer falsely selected
		interactions and polynomials than other methods.
