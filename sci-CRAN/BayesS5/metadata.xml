		Bayesian Variable Selection Using Simplified Shotgun Stochastic
		Search with Screening (S5) // In p  n settings, full posterior
		sampling using existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		algorithms is highly inefficient and often not feasible from a
		practical perspective. To overcome this problem, we propose a
		scalable stochastic search algorithm that is called the
		Simplified Shotgun Stochastic Search (S5) and aimed at rapidly
		explore interesting regions of model space and finding the
		maximum a posteriori(MAP) model. Also, the S5 provides an
		approximation of posterior probability of each model (including
		the marginal inclusion probabilities).
