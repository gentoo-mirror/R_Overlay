		Filter Raw JSATS Acoustic Telemetry Files from Lotek, ATS,
		Teknologic // Filtering of raw acoustic telemetry transmissions
		from three acoustic telemetry companies (ATS, Lotek,
		Teknologic). The filtering steps check for false positives
		caused by reflected transmissions from surfaces and false pings
		from other noise generating equipment. The filter is unique for
		each technology type. The package was written in concert with
		the Interagency Telemetry Advisory Group (iTAG) and makes use
		of the JSATS California Fish Tracking Database:
		https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/CalFishTrack/.
