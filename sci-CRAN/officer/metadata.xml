		and manipulate 'Microsoft Word' and 'Microsoft PowerPoint'
		documents from R. The package focuses on tabular and graphical
		reporting from R; it also provides two functions that let users

		existing documents. When working with 'PowerPoint'
		presentations, slides can be added or removed; shapes inside
		slides can also be added or removed. When working with 'Word'
		documents, a cursor can be used to help insert or delete
		content at a specific location in the document. The package
