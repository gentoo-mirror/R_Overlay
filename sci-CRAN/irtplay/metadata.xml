		Online Item Calibration, Scoring, and Evaluation of Model-Data
		Fit in Item Response Theory (IRT) and Useful Functions Related
		to IRT Models // Calibrate online item parameters (i.e.,
		pretest and operational items), estimate examinees abilities,
		and examine the IRT model-data fit on item-level in different
		ways as well as provide useful functions related to
		unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models. For the
		online calibration, Stocking's Method A (Ban, Hanson, Wang, Yi,
		Harris (2011) doi:10.1111/j.1745-3984.2001.tb01123.x) is
		provided. More methods of online calibration (e.g., fixed item
		parameter calibration) will be included in the future updated
		version. For the ability estimation, several popular scoring
		methods (e.g., MLE, EAP, and MAP) are implemented. In terms of
		assessing the IRT model-data fit, one of distinguished features
		of this package is that it gives not only well-known item fit
		statistics (e.g., chi-square (X2), likelihood ratio chi-square
		(G2), infit and oufit statistics, and S-X2 statistic (Ames
		Penfield (2015) doi:10.1111/emip.12067)) but also graphical
		displays to look at residuals between between the observed data
		and model-based predictions (Hambleton, Swaminathan,  Rogers
		(1991, ISBN:9780803936478)). In addition, there are many useful
		functions such as computing asymptotic variance-covariance
		matrices of item parameter estimates (Li  Lissitz (2004)
		doi:10.1111/j.1745-3984.2004.tb01109.x), importing item and/or
		ability parameters from popular IRT software, generating
		simulated data, computing the conditional distribution of
		observed scores using the Lord-Wingersky recursion formula
		(Lord  Wingersky (1984) doi:10.1207/s15324818ame1002_1),
		computing the loglikelihood of individual items, computing the
		loglikelihood of abilities, computing item and test information
		functions, computing item and test characteristic curve
		functions, and plotting item and test characteristic curves and
		item and test information functions.
