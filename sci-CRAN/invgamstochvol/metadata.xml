		Obtains the Log Likelihood for an Inverse Gamma Stochastic
		Volatility Model // Computes the log likelihood for an inverse
		gamma stochastic volatility model using a closed form
		expression of the likelihood. The details of the computation of
		this closed form expression are given in Gonzalez and Majoni
		(2023) http://rcea.org/RePEc/pdf/wp23-11.pdf . The closed form
		expression is obtained for a stationary inverse gamma
		stochastic volatility model by marginalising out the
		volatility. This allows the user to obtain the maximum
		likelihood estimator for this non linear non Gaussian state
		space model. In addition, the user can obtain the estimates of
		the smoothed volatility using the exact smoothing
		distributions.
