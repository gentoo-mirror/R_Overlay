		Dynamic (Causal) Inferences from Time Series (with Interactions)
		// Autoregressive distributed lag (A[R]DL) models (and their
		reparameterized equivalent, the Generalized Error-Correction
		Model [GECM]) (see De Boef and Keele 2008
		doi:10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00307.x) are the workhorse models
		in uncovering dynamic inferences. ADL models are simple to
		estimate; this is what makes them attractive. Once these models
		are estimated, what is less clear is how to uncover a rich set
		of dynamic inferences from these models. We provide tools for
		recovering those inferences in three forms: causal inferences
		from ADL models, traditional time series quantities of interest
		(short- and long-run effects), and dynamic conditional
		relationships.
