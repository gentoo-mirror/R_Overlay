		Signal Component Analysis for Optically Stimulated Luminescence
		// Function library for the identification and separation of
		exponentially decaying signal components in continuous-wave
		optically stimulated luminescence measurements. A special
		emphasis is laid on luminescence dating with quartz, which is
		known for systematic errors due to signal components with
		unequal physical behaviour. Also, this package enables an easy
		to use signal decomposition of data sets imported and analysed
		with the R package 'Luminescence'. This includes the optional
		automatic creation of HTML reports. Further information and
		tutorials can be found at https://luminescence.de.
