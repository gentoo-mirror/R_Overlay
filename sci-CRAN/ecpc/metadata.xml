		Flexible Co-Data Learning for High-Dimensional Prediction // Fit
		linear, logistic and Cox survival regression models penalised
		with adaptive multi-group ridge penalties. The multi-group
		penalties correspond to groups of covariates defined by
		(multiple) co-data sources. Group hyperparameters are estimated
		with an empirical Bayes method of moments, penalised with an
		extra level of hyper shrinkage. Various types of hyper
		shrinkage may be used for various co-data. The method
		accommodates inclusion of unpenalised covariates, posterior
		selection of covariates and multiple data types. The model fit
		is used to predict for new samples. The name 'ecpc' stands for
		Empirical Bayes, Co-data learnt, Prediction and Covariate
		selection. See Van Nee et al. (2020) arXiv:2005.04010.
