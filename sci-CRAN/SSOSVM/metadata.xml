		Stream Suitable Online Support Vector Machines // Soft-margin
		support vector machines (SVMs) are a common class of
		classification models. The training of SVMs usually requires
		that the data be available all at once in a single batch,
		however the Stochastic majorization-minimization (SMM)
		algorithm framework allows for the training of SVMs on streamed
		data instead Nguyen, Jones
		McLachlan(2018)doi:10.1007/s42081-018-0001-y. This package
		utilizes the SMM framework to provide functions for training
		SVMs with hinge loss, squared-hinge loss, and logistic loss.
