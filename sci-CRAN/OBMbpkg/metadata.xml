		Estimate the Population Size for the Mb Capture-Recapture Model
		// Applies an objective Bayesian method to the Mb capture-
		recapture model to estimate the population size N.  The Mb
		model is a class of capture-recapture methods used to account
		for variations in capture probability due to animal behavior.
		Under the Mb formulation,  the initial capture of an animal may
		effect the probability of subsequent captures due to their
		becoming "trap happy" or "trap shy."
