		Nominal Dates, Times, and Durations // Provides methods for
		working with nominal dates, times, and durations. Base R has
		sophisticated facilities for handling time, but these can give
		unexpected results if, for example, timezone is not handled
		properly. This package provides a more casual approach to
		support cases which do not require rigorous treatment.  It
		systematically deconstructs the concepts origin and timezone,
		and de-emphasizes the display of seconds. It also converts
		among nominal durations such as seconds, hours, days, and
		weeks. See '?datetime' and '?duration' for examples. Adapted
		from 'metrumrg' http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1215.
