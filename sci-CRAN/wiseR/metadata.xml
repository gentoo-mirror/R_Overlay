		A Shiny Application for End-to-End Bayesian Decision Network
		Analysis and Web-Deployment // A Shiny application for learning
		Bayesian Decision Networks from data. This package can be used
		for probabilistic reasoning (in the observational setting),
		causal inference (in the presence of interventions) and
		learning policy decisions (in Decision Network setting).
		Functionalities include end-to-end implementations for data-
		preprocessing, structure-learning, exact inference, approximate
		inference, extending the learned structure to Decision Networks
		and policy optimization using statistically rigorous methods
		such as bootstraps, resampling, ensemble-averaging and cross-
		validation. In addition to Bayesian Decision Networks, it also
		features correlation networks, community-detection, graph
		visualizations, graph exports and web-deployment of the learned
		models as Shiny dashboards.
