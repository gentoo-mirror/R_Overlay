		Nature-Inspired Spatial Clustering // Implement and enhance the
		performance of spatial fuzzy clustering using Fuzzy
		Geographically Weighted Clustering with various optimization
		algorithms, mainly from Xin She Yang (2014) ISBN:9780124167438
		with book entitled Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms. The
		optimization algorithm is useful to tackle the disadvantages of
		clustering inconsistency when using the traditional approach.
		The distance measurements option is also provided in order to
		increase the quality of clustering results. The Fuzzy
		Geographically Weighted Clustering with nature inspired
		optimisation algorithm was firstly developed by Arie Wahyu
		Wijayanto and Ayu Purwarianti (2014)
		doi:10.1109/CITSM.2014.7042178 using Artificial Bee Colony
		algorithm.
