		An Improved Version of WA-PLS // The goal of this package is to
		provide an improved version of WA-PLS (Weighted Averaging
		Partial Least Squares) by including the tolerances of taxa and
		the frequency of the sampled climate variable. This package
		also provides a way of leave-out cross-validation that removes
		both the test site and sites that are both geographically close
		and climatically close for each cycle, to avoid the risk of
		pseudo-replication.
