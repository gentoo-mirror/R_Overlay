		Fit Latent Multivariate Mixed Effects Location Scale Models // In
		addition to modeling the expectation (location) of an outcome,
		mixed effects location scale models (MELSMs) include submodels
		on the variance components (scales) directly. This allows
		models on the within-group variance with mixed effects, and
		between-group variances with fixed effects. The MELSM can be
		used to model volatility, intraindividual variance,
		uncertainty, measurement error variance, and more. Multivariate
		MELSMs (MMELSMs) extend the model to include multiple
		correlated outcomes, and therefore multiple locations and
		scales. The latent multivariate MELSM (LMMELSM) further
		includes multiple correlated latent variables as outcomes. This
		package implements two-level mixed effects location scale
		models on multiple observed or latent outcomes, and between-
		group variance modeling. Williams, Martin, Liu, and Rast (2020)
