		Convert Files that Use 'palmerpenguins' to Work with 'datasets'
		// From 'R' 4.5.0, the 'datasets' package includes the penguins
		and penguins_raw data sets popularised in the 'palmerpenguins'
		package. 'basepenguins' takes files that use the
		'palmerpenguins' package and converts them to work with the
		versions from 'datasets' ('R' = 4.5.0). It does this by
		removing calls to library(palmerpenguins) and making the
		necessary changes to column names. Additionally, it provides
		helper functions to define new files paths for saving the
		output and a directory of example files to experiment with.
