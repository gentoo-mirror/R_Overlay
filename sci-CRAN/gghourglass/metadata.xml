		Plot Records per Time of Day // Splits date and time of day
		components from continuous 'datetime' objects, then plots them
		using grammar of graphics ('ggplot2'). Plots can also be
		decorated with solar cycle information (e.g., sunset, sunrise,
		etc.). This is useful for data that are associated with the
		solar cycle.
