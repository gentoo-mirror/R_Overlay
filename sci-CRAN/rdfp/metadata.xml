		An Implementation of the 'DoubleClick for Publishers' API //
		Functions to interact with the 'Google DoubleClick for
		Publishers (DFP)' API https://developers.google.com/ad-
		manager/api/start (recently renamed to 'Google Ad Manager').
		This package is automatically compiled from the API WSDL (Web
		Service Description Language) files to dictate how the API is
		structured. Theoretically, all API actions are possible using
		this package; however, care must be taken to format the inputs
		correctly and parse the outputs correctly. Please see the
		'Google Ad Manager' API reference https://developers.google.com
		/ad-manager/api/rel_notes and this package's website
		https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/rdfp/ for more information,
		documentation, and examples.
