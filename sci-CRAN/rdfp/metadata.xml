		An Implementation of the 'DoubleClick for Publishers' API // An
		implementation of Google's 'DoubleClick for Publishers' (DFP)
		API https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/start
		(recently renamed to 'Google Ad Manager'). This package is
		automatically compiled from the API WSDLs (Web Service
		Description Language) files to dictate how the API is
		structured. Theoretically, all API actions are possible using
		this package; however, care must be taken to format the inputs
		correctly and parse the outputs correctly as well. Please see
		Google's DFP API reference and this package's website
		https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/rdfp/ for more information,
		documentation, and examples.
