		Photobiological Calculations // Definitions of classes, methods,
		operators and functions for use in photobiology and radiation
		meteorology and climatology. Calculation of effective
		(weighted) and not-weighted irradiances/doses, fluence rates,
		transmittance, reflectance, absorptance, absorbance and diverse
		ratios and other derived quantities from spectral data. Local
		maxima and minima. Conversion between energy- and photon-based
		units. Wavelength interpolation. Astronomical calculations
		related solar angles and day length. Colours and vision. This
		package is part of the 'r4photobiology' suite, Aphalo P. J.
