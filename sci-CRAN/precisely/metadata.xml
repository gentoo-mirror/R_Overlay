		Estimate Sample Size Based on Precision Rather than Power //
		Estimate sample size based on precision rather than power.
		'precisely' is a study planning tool to calculate sample size
		based on precision. Power calculations are focused on whether
		or not an estimate will be statistically significant;
		calculations of precision are based on the same principles as
		power calculation but turn the focus to the width of the
		confidence interval. 'precisely' is based on the work of
		'Rothman and Greenland' (2018).
