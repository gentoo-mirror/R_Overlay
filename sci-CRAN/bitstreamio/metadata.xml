		Read and Write Bits from Files, Connections and Raw Vectors //
		Bit-level reading and writing are necessary when dealing with
		many file formats e.g. compressed data and binary files.
		Currently, R connections are manipulated at the byte level.
		This package wraps existing connections and raw vectors so that
		it is possible to read bits, bit sequences, unaligned bytes and
		low-bit representations of integers.
