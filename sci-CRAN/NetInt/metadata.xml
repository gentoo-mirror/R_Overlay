		Methods for Unweighted and Weighted Network Integration //
		Implementation of network integration approaches comprising
		unweighted and weighted integration methods. Unweighted
		integration is performed considering the average, per-edge
		average, maximum and minimum of networks edges. Weighted
		integration takes into account a weight for each network during
		the fusion process, where the weights express the
		''predictiveness strength'' of each network considering a
		specific predictive task. Weights can be learned using a
		machine learning algorithm able to associate the weights to the
		assessment of the accuracy of the learning algorithm trained on
		the network itself. The implemented methods can be applied to
		effectively integrate different biological networks modelling a
		wide range of problems in bioinformatics (e.g. disease gene
		prioritization, protein function prediction, drug repurposing,
		clinical outcome prediction).
