		Predict Brain Asymmetry Based on Handedness and Dichotic
		Listening // Functional differences between the cerebral
		hemispheres are a fundamental characteristic of the human
		brain. Researchers interested in studying these differences
		often infer underlying hemispheric dominance for a certain
		function (e.g., language) from laterality indices calculated
		from observed performance or brain activation measures .
		However, any inference from observed measures to latent
		(unobserved) classes has to consider the prior probability of
		class membership in the population. The provided functions
		implement a Bayesian model for predicting hemispheric dominance
		from observed laterality indices (Sorensen and Westerhausen,
		Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition, 2020,
		doi:10.1080/1357650X.2020.1769124).
