		MCMC Sampling of Gene Genealogies Conditional on Genetic Data //
		Sample ancestral trees conditional on phased or unphased SNP
		genotype data. The actual tree sampling is done using a C++
		program that is launched within R. The package also contains
		functions for specifying the tree-sampling settings (pre-
		processing) and for storing and manipulating the sampled trees
		(post-processing). More information about 'sampletrees' can be
		found at http://stat.sfu.ca/statgen/research/sampletrees.html.
