		Ewnet: An Ensemble Wavelet Neural Network for Forecasting and
		Epicasting // Method and tool for generating time series
		forecasts using an ensemble wavelet-based auto-regressive
		neural network architecture. This method provides additional
		support of exogenous variables and also generates confidence
		interval. This package provides EWNet model for time series
		forecasting based on the algorithm by Panja, et al. (2022) and
		Panja, et al. (2023) arXiv:2206.10696
