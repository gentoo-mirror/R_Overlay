		Bayesian Network Learning with the PCHC Algorithm // Bayesian
		network learning using the PCHC algorithm. PCHC stands for PC
		Hill-Climbing. It is a new hybrid algorithm that used PC to
		construct the skeleton of the BN and then utilizes the Hill-
		Climbing greedy search. The relevant paper has been submitted
		and is currently in revision.
