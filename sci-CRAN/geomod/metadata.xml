		A Computer Program for Geotechnical Investigations // The
		'geomod' does spatial prediction of the Geotechnical soil
		properties. It predicts the spatial distribution of
		Geotechnical properties of soil e.g. shear strength,
		permeability, plasticity index, Standard Penetration Test (SPT)
		counts, etc. The output of the prediction takes the form of a
		map or a series of maps. It uses the interpolation technique
		where a single or statistically best estimate of spatial
		occurrence soil property is determined. The interpolation is
		based on both the sampled data and a variogram model for the
		spatial correlation of the sampled data. The single estimate is
		produced by a Kriging technique.
