		Basu-Dhar Bivariate Geometric Distribution // Provides functions
		to compute the joint probability mass function (pmf),
		cumulative distribution function (cdf), and survival function
		(sf) of the Basu-Dhar bivariate geometric distribution.
		Additional functionalities include the calculation of the
		correlation coefficient, covariance, and cross-factorial
		moments, as well as the generation of random variates. The
		package also implements parameter estimation based on the
		method of moments.
