		Basu-Dhar Bivariate Geometric Distribution // Computes the joint
		probability mass function (pmf), the joint cumulative function
		(cdf), the joint survival function (sf), the correlation
		coefficient, the covariance, the cross-factorial moment and
		generate random deviates for the Basu-Dhar bivariate geometric
		distribution as well the joint probability mass, cumulative and
		survival function assuming the presence of a cure fraction
		given by the standard bivariate mixture cure fraction model.
		The package also computes the estimators based on the method of
		moments.
