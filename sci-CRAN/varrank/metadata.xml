		Heuristics Tools Based on Mutual Information for Variable Ranking
		// A computational toolbox of heuristics approaches for
		performing variable ranking and feature selection based on
		mutual information well adapted for multivariate system
		epidemiology datasets. The core function is a general
		implementation of the minimum redundancy maximum relevance
		model. R. Battiti (1994) doi:10.1109/72.298224. Continuous
		variables are discretized using a large choice of rule.
		Variables ranking can be learned with a sequential
		forward/backward search algorithm. The two main problems that
		can be addressed by this package is the selection of the most
		representative variable within a group of variables of interest
		(i.e. dimension reduction) and variable ranking with respect to
		a set of features of interest.
