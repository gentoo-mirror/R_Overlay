		Helper Functions for Linear Model Analysis // A collection of
		helper functions for multiple regression models fitted by lm().
		Most of them are simple functions for simple tasks which can be
		done with coding, but may not be easy for occasional users of
		R. Most of the tasks addressed are those sometimes needed when
		using the 'manymome' package (Cheung and Cheung, 2023,
		doi:10.3758/s13428-023-02224-z) and 'stdmod' package (Cheung,
		Cheung, Lau, Hui, and Vong, 2022, doi:10.1037/hea0001188).
		However, they can also be used in other scenarios.
