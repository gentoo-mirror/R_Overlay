		Miscellaneous Extensions to 'ggplot2' // Extensions to 'ggplot2'
		respecting the grammar of graphics paradigm. Specialization of
		method ggplot(): accept and convert on the fly time series
		data. Geom: "table", "plot" and "grob" add insets to plots
		using native data coordinates, while "table_npc", "plot_npc"
		and "grob_npc" do the same using "npc" coordinates through new
		aesthetics "npcx" and "npcy". Statistics: locate and tag peaks
		and valleys; count observations in different quadrants of a
		plot; select observations based on 2D density; label with the
		equation of a polynomial fitted with lm() or other types of
		models; labels with P-value, R^2 or adjusted R^2 or information
		criteria for fitted models; label with ANOVA table for fitted
		models; label with summary for fitted models. Model fit classes
		for which suitable methods are provided by package 'broom' are
		supported. Scales and stats to build volcano and quadrant plots
		based on outcomes, fold changes, p-values and false discovery
		rates.
