		Nelson Rules for Control Charts // Implementation of Nelson rules
		for control charts in 'R'. The 'Rspc' implements some
		Statistical Process Control methods, namely Levey-Jennings type
		of I (individuals) chart, Shewhart C (count) chart and Nelson
		rules (as described in Montgomery, D. C. (2013) Introduction to
		statistical quality control. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.). Typical
		workflow is taking the time series, specify the control limits,
		and list of Nelson rules you want to evaluate. There are
		several options how to modify the rules (one sided limits,
		numerical parameters of rules, etc.). Package is also capable
		of calculating the control limits from the data (so far only
		for i-chart and c-chart are implemented).
