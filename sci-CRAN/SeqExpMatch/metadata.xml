		Sequential Experimental Design via Matching on-the-Fly //
		Generates the following sequential two-arm experimental
		designs: (1) completely randomized (Bernoulli) (2) balanced
		completely randomized (3) Efron's (1971) Biased Coin (4)
		Atkinson's (1982) Covariate-Adjusted Biased Coin (5) Kapelner
		and Krieger's (2014) Covariate-Adjusted Matching on the Fly (6)
		Kapelner and Krieger's (2021) CARA Matching on the Fly with
		Differential Covariate Weights (Naive) (7) Kapelner and
		Krieger's (2021) CARA Matching on the Fly with Differential
		Covariate Weights (Stepwise) and also provides the following
		types of inference: (1) estimation (with both Z-style
		estimators and OLS estimators), (2) frequentist testing (via
		asymptotic distribution results and via employing the
		nonparametric randomization test) and (3) frequentist
		confidence intervals (only under the superpopulation sampling
		assumption currently). Details can be found in our publication:
		Kapelner and Krieger "A Matching Procedure for Sequential
		Experiments that Iteratively Learns which Covariates Improve
		Power" (2020) arXiv:2010.05980.
