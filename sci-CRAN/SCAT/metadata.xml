		Summary Based Conditional Association Test // Conditional
		association test based on summary data from genome-wide
		association study (GWAS). SCAT adjusts for heterogeneity in SNP
		coverage that exists in summary data if SNPs are not present in
		all of the participating studies of a GWAS meta-analysis. This
		commonly happens when different reference panels are used in
		participating studies for genotype imputation. This could
		happen when ones simply do not have data for some SNPs (e.g.
		different array, or imputated data is not available). Without
		properly adjusting for this kind of heterogeneity leads to
		inflated false positive rate. SCAT can also be used to conduct
		conventional conditional analysis when coverage heterogeneity
		is absent. For more details, refer to Zhang et al. (2018) Brief
		Bioinform. 19(6):1337-1343. doi: 10.1093/bib/bbx072.
