		Fits Piecewise Polynomial with Data-Adaptive Knots in Cox Model
		// In Cox's proportional hazard model, covariates are modeled
		as linear function and may not be flexible. This package
		implements additive trend filtering Cox proportional hazards
		model as proposed in Jiacheng Wu  Daniela Witten (2019)
		"Flexible and Interpretable Models for Survival Data", Journal
		of Computational and Graphical Statistics,
		DOI:10.1080/10618600.2019.1592758. The fitted functions are
		piecewise polynomial with adaptively chosen knots.
