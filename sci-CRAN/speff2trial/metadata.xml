		Semiparametric Efficient Estimation for a Two-Sample Treatment
		Effect // Performs estimation and testing of the treatment
		effect in a 2-group randomized clinical trial with a
		quantitative, dichotomous, or right-censored time-to-event
		endpoint. The method improves efficiency by leveraging baseline
		predictors of the endpoint. The inverse probability weighting
		technique of Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (JASA, 1994) is used
		to provide unbiased estimation when the endpoint is missing at
		random.
