		Detection and Control of Tree-Ring Widths on Scanned Image
		Sections // Identification of ring borders on scanned image
		sections from dendrochronological samples. Processesing of
		image reflectances to produce gray matrices and a time series
		of smoothed gray values. Luminance data is plotted on segmented
		images for users to perform both: visual identification of ring
		borders, or control of automatic detection. Routines to
		visually include/exclude ring borders on the R graphical
		device, or automatically detect ring borders using a linear
		detection algorithm. This algorithm detects ring borders
		according to positive/negative extreme values in the smoothed
		time-series of gray values.
