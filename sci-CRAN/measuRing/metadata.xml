		Detection and Control of Tree-Ring Widths on Scanned Image
		Sections // Identification of ring borders on scanned image
		sections from dendrochronological samples. Processing of image
		reflectances to produce gray matrices and time series of
		smoothed gray values. Luminance data is plotted on segmented
		images for users to perform both: visual identification of ring
		borders, or control of automatic detection. Routines to
		visually include/exclude ring borders on the R graphical
		device, or automatically detect ring borders using a linear
		detection algorithm. This algorithm detects ring borders
		according to positive/negative extreme values in the smoothed
		time-series of gray values. Most of the in-package routines to
		detect ring borders can be implemented using the multiDetect()
		function.
