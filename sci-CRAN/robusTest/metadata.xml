		Calibrated Correlation, Two-Sample Tests // Implementation of
		corrected two-sample tests. A corrected version of the Pearson
		and Kendall correlation tests, the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) rank
		sum test, the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) signed rank test and a
		variance test are implemented. The package also proposes a test
		for the median. All these corrected tests are asymptotically
		calibrated meaning that the probability of rejection under the
		null hypothesis is asymptotically equal to the level of the
		test. The package also proposes a test for independence between
		two continuous variables of Kolmogorov-Smirnov's type. This
		test is exact.
