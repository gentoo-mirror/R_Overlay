		Calibrated Correlation and Two-Sample Tests // Implementation of
		corrected two-sample tests. A corrected version of the Pearson
		and Kendall correlation tests, the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) rank
		sum test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test and a variance test are
		implemented. The package also proposes a test for the median
		and an independence test between two continuous variables of
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov's type. All these corrected tests are
		asymptotically calibrated in the sense that the probability of
		rejection under the null hypothesis is asymptotically equal to
		the level of the test. See arXiv:2211.08784 for more details on
		the statistical tests.
