		Calculate Regional Consistency Probabilities for Multi-Regional
		Clinical Trials // Provides methods to calculate approximate
		regional consistency probabilities using Method 1 and Method 2
		proposed by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare
		(2007) https://www.pmda.go.jp/files/000153265.pdf. These
		methods are useful for assessing regional consistency in multi-
		regional clinical trials.  The package can calculate
		unconditional, joint, and conditional regional consistency
		probabilities.  For technical details, please see Homma (2024)
