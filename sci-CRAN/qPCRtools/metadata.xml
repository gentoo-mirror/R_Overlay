		Tools for qPCR // qPCR is a widely used method to detect the
		expression level of genes in biological research. A crucial
		step in processing qPCR data is to calculate the amplification
		efficiency of genes to determine which method should be used to
		calculate expression level of genes. This Package can do it
		easily. In addition to that, this package can calculate the
		expression level of genes based on three methods.
