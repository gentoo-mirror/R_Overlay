		Combining Tree-Boosting with Gaussian Process and Mixed Effects
		Models // An R package that allows for combining tree-boosting
		with Gaussian process and mixed effects models. It also allows
		for independently doing tree-boosting as well as inference and
		prediction for Gaussian process and mixed effects models. See
		https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost for more information on the
		software and Sigrist (2020) arXiv:2004.02653 and Sigrist (2021)
		arXiv:2105.08966 for more information on the methodology.
