		Combining Tree-Boosting with Gaussian Process and Mixed Effects
		Models // An R package that allows for combining tree-boosting
		with Gaussian process and mixed effects models. It also allows
		for independently doing tree-boosting as well as inference and
		prediction for Gaussian process and mixed effects models. See
		https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost for more information on the
		software and Sigrist (2022, JMLR)
		https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v23/20-322.html and Sigrist (2023,
		TPAMI) doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3168152 for more information on
		the methodology.
