		Gaussian Process with Histogram Intersection Kernel // Provides
		an implementation of a Gaussian process regression with a
		histogram intersection kernel (HIK) and utilizes approximations
		to speed up learning and prediction. In contrast to a squared
		exponential kernel, an HIK provides advantages such as linear
		memory and learning time requirements. However, the HIK only
		provides a piecewise-linear approximation of the function.
		Furthermore, the number of estimated eigenvalues is reduced.
		The eigenvalues and vectors are required for the approximation
		of the log-likelihood function as well as the approximation of
		the predicted variance of new samples. This package provides
		approximations for a single eigenvalue as well as multiple.
		Further information of the variance and log-likelihood
		approximation, as well as the Gaussian process with HIK, can be
		found in the paper by Rodner et al. (2016)
