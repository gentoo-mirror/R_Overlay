		Fast Cross-Validation via Sequential Testing // The fast cross-
		validation via sequential testing (CVST) procedure is an
		improved cross-validation procedure which uses non-parametric
		testing coupled with sequential analysis to determine the best
		parameter set on linearly increasing subsets of the data. By
		eliminating under-performing candidates quickly and keeping
		promising candidates as long as possible, the method speeds up
		the computation while preserving the capability of a full
		cross-validation. Additionally to the CVST the package contains
		an implementation of the ordinary k-fold cross-validation with
		a flexible and powerful set of helper objects and methods to
		handle the overall model selection process. The implementations
		of the Cochran's Q test with permutations and the sequential
		testing framework of Wald are generic and can therefore also be
		used in other contexts.
