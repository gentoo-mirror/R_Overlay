		Least-Squares Bilinear Clustering for Three-Way Data // Functions
		for performing least-squares bilinear clustering of three-way
		data. The method uses the bilinear decomposition (or bi-
		additive model) to model two-way matrix slices while clustering
		over the third way. Up to four different types of clusters are
		included, one for each term of the bilinear decomposition. In
		this way, matrices are clustered simultaneously on (a subset
		of) their overall means, row margins, column margins and row-
		column interactions. The orthogonality of the bilinear model
		results in separability of the joint clustering problem into
		four separate ones. Three of these sub-problems are specific
		k-means problems, while a special algorithm is implemented for
		the interactions. Plotting methods are provided, including
		biplots for the low-rank approximations of the interactions.
