		Least-Squares Bilinear Clustering for Three-Way Data // Functions
		for performing least-squares bilinear clustering of three-way
		data. The method uses the bilinear decomposition (or biadditive
		model) to model two-way matrix slices while clustering over the
		third way. Up to four different types of clusters are included,
		one for each term of the bilinear decomposition. In this way,
		matrices are clustered simultaneously on (a subset of) their
		overall means, row margins, column margins and row-column
		interactions. The orthogonality of the bilinear model results
		in separability of the joint clustering problem into four
		separate ones. Three of these subproblems are specific k-means
		problems, while a special algorithm is implemented for the
		interactions. Plotting methods are provided, including biplots
		for the low-rank approximations of the interactions.
