		Preference Voting with Explanatory Graphics // Implements the
		Single Transferable Vote (STV) electoral system, with clear
		explanatory graphics. The core function stv() uses Meek's
		method, the purest expression of the simple principles of STV,
		but which requires electronic counting. It can handle votes
		expressing equal preferences for subsets of the candidates. A
		function stv.wig() implementing the Weighted Inclusive Gregory
		method, as used in Scottish council elections, is also
		provided, and with the same options, as described in the
		manual. The required vote data format is as an R list: a
		function pref.data() is provided to transform some commonly
		used data formats into this format. References for methodology:
