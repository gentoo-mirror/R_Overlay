		Implement 'tableGrob' Object as a Clickable Image Map //
		Implement 'tableGrob' object as a clickable image map. The
		'clickableImageMap' package is designed to be more convenient
		and more configurable than the edit() function. Limitations
		that I have encountered with edit() are cannot control (1)
		positioning (2) size (3) appearance and formatting of fonts In
		contrast, when the table is implemented as a 'tableGrob', all
		of these features are controllable. In particular, the
		'ggplot2' grid system allows exact positioning of the table
		relative to other graphics etc.
