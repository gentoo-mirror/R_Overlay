		Functions for Robust Variable Handling // Variables are the
		fundamental parts of each programming language but handling
		them efficiently might be frustrating for programmers. This
		package contains some functions to help user (especially data
		explorers) to make more sense of their variables and take the
		most out of variables and hardware resources. These functions
		are written, collected and crafted over 7 years of experience
		in statistical data analysis on high-dimensional data, and for
		each of them there was a need. Functions in this package are
		suppose to be efficient and easy to use, hence they will be
		frequently updated to make them more convenient.
