		Prediction and Accuracy Measures for Nonlinear Models and for
		Right-Censored Time-to-Event Data // We propose a pair of
		summary measures for the predictive power of a prediction
		function based on a regression model. The regression model can
		be linear or nonlinear, parametric, semi-parametric, or
		nonparametric, and correctly specified or mis-specified. The
		first measure, R-squared, is an extension of the classical
		R-squared statistic for a linear model, quantifying the
		prediction function's ability to capture the variability of the
		response. The second measure, L-squared, quantifies the
		prediction function's bias for predicting the mean regression
		function. When used together, they give a complete summary of
		the predictive power of a prediction function. Please refer to
		Gang Li and Xiaoyan Wang (2016) arXiv:1611.03063 for more
		details.
