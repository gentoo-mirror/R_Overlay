		Analysis of Biological Count Data, Especially from Single-Cell
		RNA-Seq // A set of functions for applying a restricted linear
		algebra to the analysis of count-based data. See the
		accompanying preprint manuscript: "Normalizing need not be the
		norm: count-based math for analyzing single-cell data" Church
		et al (2022) doi:10.1101/2022.06.01.494334 This tool is
		specifically designed to analyze count matrices from single
		cell RNA sequencing assays. The tools implement several count-
		based approaches for standard steps in single-cell RNA-seq
		analysis, including scoring genes and cells, comparing cells
		and clustering, calculating differential gene expression, and
		several methods for rank reduction. There are many
		opportunities for further optimization that may prove useful in
		the analysis of other data. We provide the source code freely
		available at https://github.com/shchurch/countland and
		encourage users and developers to fork the code for their own
		purposes.
