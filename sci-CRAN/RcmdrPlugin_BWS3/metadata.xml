		R Commander Plug-in for Case 3 Best-Worst Scaling // Adds menu
		items for case 3 (multi-profile) best-worst scaling (BWS3) to
		the R Commander. BWS3 is a question-based survey method that
		designs various combinations of attribute levels (profiles),
		asks respondents to select the best and worst profiles in each
		choice set, and then measures preferences for the attribute
		levels by analyzing the responses. For details on BWS3, refer
		to Louviere et al. (2015) doi:10.1017/CBO9781107337855.
