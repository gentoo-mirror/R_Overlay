		Regression-Based Approach for Testing the Type of Missing Data //
		The regression-based (RB) approach is a method to test the
		missing data mechanism. This package contains two functions
		that test the type of missing data (Missing Completely At
		Random vs Missing At Random) on the basis of the RB approach.
		The first function applies the RB approach independently on
		each variable with missing data, using the completely observed
		variables only. The second function tests the missing data
		mechanism globally (on all variables with missing data) with
		the use of all available information. The algorithm is adapted
		both to continuous and categorical data.
