		Covariate Dependent Graph Estimation // A covariate-dependent
		approach to Gaussian graphical modeling as described in
		Dasgupta et al. (2022). Employs a novel weighted pseudo-
		likelihood approach to model the conditional dependence
		structure of data as a continuous function of an extraneous
		covariate. The main function, covdepGE::covdepGE(), estimates a
		graphical representation of the conditional dependence
		structure via a block mean-field variational approximation,
		while several auxiliary functions (inclusionCurve(), matViz(),
		and plot.covdepGE()) are included for visualizing the resulting
		estimates.
