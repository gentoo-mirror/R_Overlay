		Diversity Dynamics using Fossil Sampling Data // Functions to
		describe sampling and diversity dynamics of fossil occurrence
		datasets (e.g. from the Paleobiology Database). The package
		includes methods to calculate range- and occurrence-based
		metrics of taxonomic richness, extinction and origination
		rates, along with traditional sampling measures. A powerful
		subsampling tool is also included that implements frequently
		used sampling standardization methods in a multiple bin-
		framework. The plotting of time series and the occurrence data
		can be simplified by the functions incorporated in the package,
		as well as other calculations, such as environmental affinities
		and extinction selectivity testing. Details can be found in:
