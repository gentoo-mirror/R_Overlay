		Tools to Create, Modify and Manage 'CWB' Corpora // The 'Corpus
		Workbench' ('CWB', http://cwb.sourceforge.net/) offers a
		classic and mature approach for working with large,
		linguistically and structurally annotated corpora. The 'CWB' is
		memory efficient and its design makes running queries fast
		(Evert and Hardie 2011, http://www.stefan-
		evert.de/PUB/EvertHardie2011.pdf). The 'cwbtools' package
		offers pure R tools to create indexed corpus files as well as
		high-level wrappers for the original C implementation of CWB as
		exposed by the 'RcppCWB' package
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppCWB. Additional
		functionality to add and modify annotations of corpora from
		within R makes working with CWB indexed corpora much more
		flexible and convenient. The 'cwbtools' package in combination
		with the R packages 'RcppCWB'
		(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppCWB) and 'polmineR'
		(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polmineR) offers a
		lightweight infrastructure to support the combination of
		quantitative and qualitative approaches for working with
		textual data.
