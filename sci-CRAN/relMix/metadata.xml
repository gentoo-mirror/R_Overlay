		Relationship Inference for DNA Mixtures // Analysis of DNA
		mixtures involving relatives by computation of likelihood
		ratios that account for dropout and drop-in, mutations, silent
		alleles and population substructure. This is useful in kinship
		cases, like non-invasive prenatal paternity testing, where
		deductions about individuals' relationships rely on DNA
		mixtures, and in criminal cases where the contributors to a
		mixed DNA stain may be related. Relationships are represented
		by pedigrees and can include kinship between more than two
		individuals. The main function is relMix() and its graphical
		user interface relMixGUI(). The implementation and method is
		described in Dorum et al. (2017)
