		Ordinal Outcomes: Generalized Linear Models with the Log Link //
		An implementation of the Log Cumulative Probability Model
		(LCPM) and Proportional Probability Model (PPM) for which the
		Maximum Likelihood Estimates are determined using constrained
		optimization. This implementation accounts for the implicit
		constraints on the parameter space. Other features such as
		standard errors, z tests and p-values use standard methods
		adapted from the results based on constrained optimization.
