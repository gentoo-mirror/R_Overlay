		Methods for Robust Rank Aggregation // Methods for aggregating
		ranked lists, especially lists of genes. It implements the
		Robust Rank Aggregation Kolde et al (2012)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr709 and some other simple
		algorithms for the task. RRA method uses a probabilistic model
		for aggregation that is robust to noise and also facilitates
		the calculation of significance probabilities for all the
		elements in the final ranking.
