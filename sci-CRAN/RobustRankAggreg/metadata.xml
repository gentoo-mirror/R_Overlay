		Methods for robust rank aggregation // Methods for aggregating
		ranked lists, especially lists of genes. It implements the
		Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al in preparation) and some
		other simple algorithms for the task. RRA method uses a
		probabilistic model for aggregation that is robust to noise and
		also facilitates the calculation of significance probabilities
		for all the elements in the final ranking.
