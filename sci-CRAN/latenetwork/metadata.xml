		Inference on LATEs under Network Interference of Unknown Form //
		Estimating causal parameters in the presence of treatment
		spillover is of great interest in statistics. This package
		provides tools for instrumental variables estimation of average
		causal effects under network interference of unknown form. The
		target parameters are the local average direct effect, the
		local average indirect effect, the local average overall
		effect, and the local average spillover effect. The methods are
		developed by Hoshino and Yanagi (2023)
