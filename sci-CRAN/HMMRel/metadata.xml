		Hidden Markov Models for Reliability and Maintenance //
		Reliability Analysis and Maintenance Optimization using Hidden
		Markov Models (HMM). The use of HMMs to model the state of a
		system which is not directly observable and instead certain
		indicators (signals) of the true situation are provided via a
		control system. A hidden model can provide key information
		about the system dependability, such as the reliability of the
		system and related measures. An estimation procedure is
		implemented based on the Baum-Welch algorithm. Classical
		structures such as K-out-of-N systems and Shock models are
		illustrated. Finally, the maintenance of the system is
		considered in the HMM context and two functions for new
		preventive maintenance strategies are considered. Maintenance
		efficiency is measured in terms of expected cost. Methods are
		described in Gamiz, Limnios, and Segovia-Garcia (2023)
