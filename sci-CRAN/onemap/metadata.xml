		Construction of Genetic Maps in Experimental Crosses: Full-Sib,
		RILs, F2 and Backcrosses // Analysis of molecular marker data
		from model (backcrosses, F2 and recombinant inbred lines) and
		non-model systems (i. e. outcrossing species). For the later,
		it allows statistical analysis by simultaneously estimating
		linkage and linkage phases (genetic map construction) according
		to Wu et al. (2002) doi:10.1006/tpbi.2002.1577. All analysis
		are based on multipoint approaches using hidden Markov models.
