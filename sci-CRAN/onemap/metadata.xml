		Construction of Genetic Maps in Experimental Crosses // Analysis
		of molecular marker data from model and non-model systems. For
		the later, it allows statistical analysis by simultaneously
		estimating linkage and linkage phases (genetic map
		construction) according to Wu and colleagues (2002)
		doi:10.1006/tpbi.2002.1577. All analysis are based on multi-
