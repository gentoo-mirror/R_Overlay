		Non-Linear Height Diameter Models for Forestry // Tree height is
		an important dendrometric variable and forms the basis of
		vertical structure of a forest stand. This package will help to
		fit and validate various non-linear height diameter models for
		assessing the underlying relationship that exists between tree
		height and diameter at breast height in case of conifer trees.
		This package has been implemented on Naslund, Curtis,
		Michailoff, Meyer, Power, Michaelis-Menten and Wykoff non
		linear models using algorithm of  Huang et al.  (1992)
		doi:10.1139/x92-172 and Zeide et al. (1993)
