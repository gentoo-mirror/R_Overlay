		Exact Nonparametric Hypothesis Tests for the Mean, Variance and
		Stochastic Inequality // Provides several novel exact
		hypothesis tests with minimal assumptions on the errors. The
		tests are exact, meaning that their p-values are correct for
		the given sample sizes (the p-values are not derived from
		asymptotic analysis). The test for stochastic inequality is for
		ordinal comparisons based on two independent samples and
		requires no assumptions on the errors. The other tests include
		tests for the mean and variance of a single sample and
		comparing means in independent samples. All these tests only
		require that the data has known bounds (such as percentages
		that lie in [0,100]. These bounds are part of the input.
