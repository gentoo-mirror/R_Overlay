		SODA: Main and Interaction Effects Selection for Logistic
		Regression, Quadratic Discriminant and General Index Models //
		Variable and interaction selection are essential to
		classification in high-dimensional setting. In this package, we
		provide the implementation of SODA procedure, which is a
		forward-backward algorithm that selects both main and
		interaction effects under logistic regression and quadratic
		discriminant analysis. We also provide an extension, S-SODA,
		for dealing with the variable selection problem for semi-
		parametric models with continuous responses.
