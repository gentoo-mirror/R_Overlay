		'PLINK' (and 'GCTA') File Helpers // Provide function that reads
		binary genotype produced by 'PLINK' https://www.cog-
		genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed into a R matrix, or scan the
		genotype one variant at a time like apply(), it also provides
		functions that reads and writes genotype relatedness/kinship
		matrices created by 'PLINK' https://www.cog-
		genomics.org/plink/1.9/distance#make_rel or 'GCTA'
		https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#MakingaGRM. Currently it
		does not support writing back into 'PLINK' binary, it is best
		used for bringing data produced by 'PLINK' and 'GCTA' into R
		environment.
