		Elo Rating of a USCF Member // Given a U.S. Chess Federation ID
		number, the elo() function will return the classical Elo rating
		of that player. The function retrieves the information from the
		USCF website, making it easier for tournament directors at
		large tournaments to quickly retrieve the ratings of
		participants.
