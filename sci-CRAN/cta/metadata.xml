		Contingency Table Analysis Based on ML Fitting of MPH Models //
		Contingency table analysis is performed based on maximum
		likelihood (ML) fitting of multinomial-Poisson homogeneous
		(MPH) and homogeneous linear predictor (HLP) models. See Lang
		(2004) doi:10.1214/aos/1079120140 and Lang (2005)
		doi:10.1198/016214504000001042 for MPH and HLP models. Objects
		computed include model goodness-of-fit statistics; likelihood-
		based (cell- and link-specific) residuals; and cell probability
		and expected count estimates along with standard errors. This
		package can also compute test-inversion--e.g. Wald, profile
		likelihood, score, power-divergence--confidence intervals for
		contingency table estimands, when table probabilities are
		potentially subject to equality constraints. For test-inversion
		intervals, see Lang (2008) doi:10.1002/sim.3391 and Zhu (2020)
		doi:10.17077/etd.005331.
