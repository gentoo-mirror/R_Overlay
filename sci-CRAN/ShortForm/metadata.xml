		Automatic Short Form Creation // Performs automatic creation of
		short forms of scales with an ant colony optimization algorithm
		and a Tabu search. As implemented in the package, the ant
		colony algorithm randomly selects items to build a model of a
		specified length, then updates the probability of item
		selection according to the fit of the best model within each
		set of searches. The algorithm continues until the same items
		are selected by multiple ants a given number of times in a row.
		On the other hand, the Tabu search changes one parameter at a
		time to be either free, constrained, or fixed while keeping
		track of the changes made and putting changes that result in
		worse fit in a "tabu" list so that the algorithm does not
		revisit them for some number of searches. See Leite, Huang,
		Marcoulides (2008) doi:10.1080/00273170802285743 for an applied
		example of the ant colony algorithm, and Marcoulides  Falk
		(2018) doi:10.1080/10705511.2017.1409074 for an applied example
		of the Tabu search.
