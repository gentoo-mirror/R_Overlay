		Automatic Short Form Creation // Performs automatic creation of
		short forms of scales with an ant colony optimization
		algorithm. As implemented in the package, the algorithm
		randomly selects items to build a model of a specified length,
		then updates the probability of item selection according to the
		fit of the best model within each set of searches. The
		algorithm continues until the same items are selected by
		multiple ants a given number of times in a row. See Leite,
		Huang,  Marcoulides (2008) doi:10.1080/00273170802285743 for an
		applied example.
