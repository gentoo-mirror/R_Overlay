		Analysis of RD Designs with Multiple Cutoffs or Scores // The
		regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-
		experimental design for causal inference and policy evaluation.
		The 'rdmulti' package provides tools to analyze RD designs with
		multiple cutoffs or scores: rdmc() estimates pooled and cutoff
		specific effects for multi-cutoff designs, rdmcplot() draws RD
		plots for multi-cutoff designs and rdms() estimates effects in
		cumulative cutoffs or multi-score designs. See Cattaneo,
		Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2020)
		https://rdpackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Titiunik-
		VazquezBare_2020_Stata.pdf for further methodological details.
