		Analysis of RD Designs with Multiple Cutoffs or Scores // The
		regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-
		experimental design for causal inference and policy evaluation.
		The 'rdmulti' package provides tools to analyze RD designs with
		multiple cutoffs or scores: rdmc() estimates pooled and cutoff
		specific effects for multi-cutoff designs, rdmcplot() draws RD
		plots for multi-cutoff designs and rdms() estimates effects in
		cumulative cutoffs or multi-score designs. See Cattaneo,
		Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2019)

		Titiunik-VazquezBare_2019_rdmulti.pdf for further
		methodological details.
