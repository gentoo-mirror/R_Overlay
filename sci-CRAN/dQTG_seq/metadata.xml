		A BSA Software for Detecting All Types of QTLs in BC, DH, RIL and
		F2 // The new (dQTG.seq1 and dQTG.seq2) and existing
		(SmoothLOD, G', deltaSNP and ED) bulked segregant analysis
		methods are used to identify various types of quantitative
		trait loci for complex traits via extreme phenotype individuals
		in bi-parental segregation populations (F2, backcross, doubled
		haploid and recombinant inbred line). The numbers of marker
		alleles in extreme low and high pools are used in existing
		methods to identify trait-related genes, while the numbers of
		marker alleles and genotypes in extreme low and high pools are
		used in the new methods to construct a new statistic Gw for
		identifying trait-related genes. dQTG-seq2 is feasible to
		identify extremely over-dominant and small-effect genes in F2.
