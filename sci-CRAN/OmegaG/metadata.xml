		Omega-Generic: Composite Reliability of Multidimensional Measures
		// It is a computer tool to estimate the item-sum score's
		reliability (composite reliability, CR) in multidimensional
		scales with overlapping items. An item that measures more than
		one domain construct is called an overlapping item. The
		estimation is based on factor models allowing unlimited cross-
		factor loadings such as exploratory structural equation
		modeling (ESEM) and Bayesian structural equation modeling
		(BSEM). The factor models include correlated-factor models and
		bi-factor models. Specifically for bi-factor models, a type of
		hierarchical factor model, the package estimates the CR
		hierarchical subscale/hierarchy and CR subscale/scale total.
		The CR estimator 'Omega-generic' was proposed by Mai,
		Srivastava, and Krull (2021) https://whova.com/embedded/subsess
		ion/enars_202103/1450751/1452993/. The current version can only
		handle continuous data. Yujiao Mai contributes to the
		algorithms, R programming, and application example. Deo Kumar
		Srivastava contributes to the algorithms and the application
		example. Kevin R. Krull contributes to the application example.
		The package 'OmegaG' was sponsored by American Lebanese Syrian
		Associated Charities (ALSAC). However, the contents of 'OmegaG'
		do not necessarily represent the policy of the ALSAC.
