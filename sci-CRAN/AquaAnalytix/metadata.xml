		Water Quality Analysis // A varied array of mathematical
		derivations from various titrimetric and colorimetric methods
		for analyzing water quality parameters were condensed and
		integrated for the better physicochemical analysis. It is
		indispensable for managing any aquatic ecosystem, including
		aquaculture facilities. By substituting titrant and
		spectrophotometric absorbance readings, accurate determination
		of the concentrations of critical parameters such as Dissolved
		Oxygen, Free Carbon Dioxide, Total Alkalinity, Water Hardness,
		Hydrogen Sulfide, Total Ammonia Nitrogen, Nitrite, Nitrate,
		Chlorinity, Salinity, Inorganic Phosphate, and Transparency can
		be facilitated APHA(2017,ISBN:9780875532875).
