		Pseudo-Ranks // Efficient calculation of pseudo-ranks and
		(pseudo)-rank based test statistics. In case of equal sample
		sizes, pseudo-ranks and mid-ranks are equal. When used for
		inference mid-ranks may lead to paradoxical results. Pseudo-
		ranks are in general not affected by such a problem. See Happ
		et al. (2020, doi:10.18637/jss.v095.c01) for details.
