		Pseudo-Ranks // Efficient calculation of pseudo-ranks. In case of
		equal sample sizes, pseudo-ranks and mid-ranks are equal. When
		used for inference mid-ranks may lead to paradoxical results.
		Pseudo-ranks are in general not affected by such a problem. For
		details, see Brunner, E., Bathke A. C. and Konietschke, F:
		Rank- and Pseudo-Rank Procedures in Factorial Designs - Using R
		and SAS, Springer Verlag, to appear.
