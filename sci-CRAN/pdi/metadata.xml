		Phenotypic Index Measures for Oak Decline Severity // Oak
		declines are complex disease syndromes and consist of many
		visual indicators that include aspects of tree size, crown
		condition and trunk condition. This can cause difficulty in the
		manual classification of symptomatic and non-symptomatic trees
		from what is in reality a broad spectrum of oak tree health
		condition. Two phenotypic oak decline indexes have been
		developed to quantitatively describe and differentiate oak
		decline syndromes in Quercus robur. This package provides a
		toolkit to generate these decline indexes from phenotypic
		descriptors using the machine learning algorithm random forest.
