		Sequential Pairwise Online Rating Techniques // Calculates
		ratings for two-player or multi-player challenges. Methods
		included in package such as are able to estimate ratings
		(players strengths) and their evolution in time, also able to
		predict output of challenge. Algorithms are based on Bayesian
		Approximation Method, and they don't involve any matrix
		inversions nor likelihood estimation. Parameters are updated
		sequentially, and computation doesn't require any additional
		RAM to make estimation feasible. Additionally, base of the
		package is written in C++ what makes sport computation even
		faster. Methods used in the package refer to Mark E. Glickman
