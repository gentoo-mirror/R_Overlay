		Measuring Multivariate Dependence Using Distance Multivariance //
		Distance multivariance is a measure of dependence which can be
		used to detect and quantify dependence of arbitrarily many
		random vectors. The necessary functions are implemented in this
		packages and examples are given. It includes: distance
		multivariance, distance multicorrelation, dependence structure
		detection, tests of independence and copula versions of
		distance multivariance based on the Monte Carlo empirical
		transform. Detailed references are given in the package
		description, as starting point for the theoretic background we
		refer to: B. Bttcher, Dependence and Dependence Structures:
		Estimation and Visualization Using the Unifying Concept of
		Distance Multivariance. Open Statistics, Vol. 1, No. 1 (2020),
		doi:10.1515/stat-2020-0001.
