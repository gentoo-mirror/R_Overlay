		Measuring Multivariate Dependence Using Distance Multivariance //
		Distance multivariance is a measure of dependence which can be
		used to detect and quantify dependence structures. The
		necessary functions are implemented in this packages, and
		examples are given. For the theoretic background we refer to
		the forthcoming papers: B. Bttcher, M. Keller-Ressel, R.L.
		Schilling (2017) Detecting independence of random vectors I +
		II. Preprints.
