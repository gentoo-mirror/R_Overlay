		Spatial Phylogenetic Analysis // Analyze spatial phylogenetic
		diversity patterns. Use your data on an evolutionary tree and
		geographic distributions of the terminal taxa to compute
		diversity and endemism metrics, test significance with null
		model randomization, analyze community turnover and biotic
		regionalization, and perform spatial conservation
		prioritizations. All functions support quantitative community
		data in addition to binary data.
