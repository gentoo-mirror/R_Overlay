		Fits Integral Projection Models Using an Expression Based
		Framework // Flexibly implements Integral Projection Models
		using an expression based framework. This will not abstract
		away the model selection process, but it will make sure you get
		everything after that correct. It handles density dependence
		and environmental stochasticity, with a couple of options for
		implementing the latter. In addition, provides functions to
		avoid unintentional eviction of individuals from models.
		Additionally, provides model diagnostic tools, plotting
		functionality, stochastic/deterministic simulations, and
		analysis tools. Integral projection models are described in
		depth by Easterling et al. (2000)
