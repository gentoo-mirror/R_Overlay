		Small Area Estimation Using Model-Assisted Projection Method //
		Combines information from two independent surveys using a
		model-assisted projection method. Designed for survey sampling
		scenarios where a large sample collects only auxiliary
		information (Survey 1) and a smaller sample provides data on
		both variables of interest and auxiliary variables (Survey 2).
		Implements a working model to generate synthetic values of the
		variable of interest by fitting the model to Survey 2 data and
		predicting values for Survey 1 based on its auxiliary variables
