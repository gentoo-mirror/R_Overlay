		Simulating Oncology Trials using an Illness-Death Model // Based
		on the illness-death model a large number of clinical trials
		with oncology endpoints progression-free survival (PFS) and
		overall survival (OS) can be simulated, see Meller, Beyersmann
		and Rufibach (2019) doi:10.1002/sim.8295.  The simulation set-
		up allows for random and event-driven censoring, an arbitrary
		number of treatment arms, staggered study entry and drop-out.
		Exponentially, Weibull and piecewise exponentially distributed
		survival times can be generated.
