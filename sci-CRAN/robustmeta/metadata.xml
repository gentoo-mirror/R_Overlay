		Robust Inference for Meta-Analysis with Influential Outlying
		Studies // Robust inference methods for fixed-effect and
		random-effects models of meta-analysis are implementable. The
		robust methods are developed using the density power divergence
		that is a robust estimating criterion developed in machine
		learning theory, and can effectively circumvent biases and
		misleading results caused by influential outliers. The density
		power divergence is originally introduced by Basu et al. (1998)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/85.3.549, and the meta-analysis methods are
		developed by Noma et al. (2022) forthcoming.
