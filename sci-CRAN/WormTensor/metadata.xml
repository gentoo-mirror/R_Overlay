		A Clustering Method for Time-Series Whole-Brain Activity Data of
		'C. elegans' // A toolkit to detect clusters from distance
		matrices. The distance matrices are assumed to be calculated
		between the cells of multiple animals ('Caenorhabditis
		elegans') from input time-series matrices. Some functions for
		generating distance matrices, performing clustering, evaluating
		the clustering, and visualizing the results of clustering and
		evaluation are available. We're also providing the download
		function to retrieve the calculated distance matrices from
		'figshare' https://figshare.com.
