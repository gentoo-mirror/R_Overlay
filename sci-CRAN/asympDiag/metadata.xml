		Diagnostic Tools for Asymptotic Theory // Leveraging Monte Carlo
		simulations, this package provides tools for diagnosing
		regression models. It implements a parametric bootstrap
		framework to compute statistics, generates diagnostic envelopes
		to assess goodness-of-fit, and evaluates type I error control
		for Wald tests. By simulating data under the assumption that
		the model is true, it helps to identify model mis-
		specifications and enhances the reliability of the model
		inferences.
