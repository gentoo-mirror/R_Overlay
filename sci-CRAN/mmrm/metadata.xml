		Mixed Models for Repeated Measures // Mixed models for repeated
		measures (MMRM) are a popular choice for analyzing longitudinal
		continuous outcomes in randomized clinical trials and beyond;
		see Cnaan, Laird and Slasor (1997)
		doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19971030)16:20%3C2349::AID-
		SIM667%3E3.0.CO;2-E for a tutorial and Mallinckrodt, Lane and
		Schnell (2008) doi:10.1177/009286150804200402 for a review.
		This package implements MMRM based on the marginal linear model
		without random effects using Template Model Builder ('TMB')
		which enables fast and robust model fitting. Users can specify
		a variety of covariance matrices, weight observations, fit
		models with restricted or standard maximum likelihood
		inference, perform hypothesis testing with Satterthwaite
		adjusted degrees of freedom, and extract least square means
		estimates by using 'emmeans'.
