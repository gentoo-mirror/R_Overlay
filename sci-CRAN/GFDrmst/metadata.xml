		Multiple RMST-Based Tests in General Factorial Designs // We
		implemented multiple tests based on the restricted mean
		survival time (RMST) for general factorial designs as described
		in Munko et al. (2024) doi:10.1002/sim.10017. Therefore, an
		asymptotic test, a groupwise bootstrap test, and a permutation
		test are incorporated with a Wald-type test statistic. The
		asymptotic and groupwise bootstrap test take the asymptotic
		exact dependence structure of the test statistics into account
		to gain more power. Furthermore, confidence intervals for RMST
		contrasts can be calculated and plotted and a stepwise
		extension that can improve the power of the multiple tests is
		available.
