		Processes Binary Data Obtained from Fragment Analysis (Such as
		AFLPs, ISSRs, and RFLPs) // A molecular genetics tool that
		processes binary data from fragment analysis. It consolidates
		replicate sample pairs, outputs summary statistics, and
		produces hierarchical clustering trees and nMDS plots. This
		package was developed from the publication available here: http
		s://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964420306538
		. The GUI version of this package is available on the R Shiny
		online server at:
		https://clarkevansteenderen.shinyapps.io/BINMAT/ or it is
		accessible via GitHub by typing: shiny::runGitHub("BinMat",
		"clarkevansteenderen") into the console in R. Two real-world
		datasets accompany the package: an AFLP dataset of Bunias
		orientalis samples from Tewes et. al. (2017) https://besjournal
		s.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.12869, and
		an ISSR dataset of Nymphaea specimens from Reid et. al. (2021) 
		https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030437702100
		0218 . The authors of these publications are thanked for
		allowing the use of their data.
