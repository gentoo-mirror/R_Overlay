		Processes Binary Data Obtained from Fragment Analysis (Such as
		AFLPs, ISSRs, and RFLPs) // A molecular genetics tool that
		processes binary data from fragment analysis. It consolidates
		replicate sample pairs, outputs summary statistics, and
		produces hierarchical clustering trees and nMDS plots. This
		package was developed from the M.Sc. thesis entitled "A genetic
		analysis of the species and intraspecific lineages of
		Dactylopius Costa (Hemiptera:Dactylopiidae)" (van Steenderen,
		2019, Rhodes University, Department of Zoology and Entomology,
		Center for Biological Control (CBC)
		https://www.ru.ac.za/centreforbiologicalcontrol/, Grahamstown,
		South Africa), doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.28470.86083. The GUI version
		of this package is available on the R Shiny online server at:
		https://clarkevansteenderen.shinyapps.io/BINMAT/ , or it is
		accessible via GitHub by typing: shiny::runGitHub("BinMat",
		"CJMvS") into the console in R.
