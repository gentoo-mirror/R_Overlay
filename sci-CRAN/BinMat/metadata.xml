		Processes Binary Data Obtained from Fragment Analysis // A
		molecular genetics tool that processes binary data from
		fragment analysis, such as inter-simple sequence repeats
		(ISSRs) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). It
		consolidates replicate sample pairs, outputs summary
		statistics, and produces hierarchical clustering trees and nMDS
		plots. This package was developed from the M.Sc. thesis
		entitled "A genetic analysis of the species and intraspecific
		lineages of Dactylopius Costa (Hemiptera:Dactylopiidae)" (van
		Steenderen, 2019, Rhodes University, Department of Zoology and
		Entomology, Center for Biological Control (CBC)
		https://www.ru.ac.za/centreforbiologicalcontrol/, Grahamstown,
		South Africa), doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.28470.86083. The GUI version
		of this package is available on the R Shiny online server at:
		https://clarkevansteenderen.shinyapps.io/BINMAT/ , or it is
		accessible via GitHub by typing: shiny::runGitHub("BinMat",
		"CJMvS") into the console in R. Please see the vignette
		supplied with the package for a worked example, and detailed
		explanations of functions.
