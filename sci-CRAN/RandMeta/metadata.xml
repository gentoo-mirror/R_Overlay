		Efficient Numerical Algorithm for Exact Inference in Meta
		Analysis // A novel numerical algorithm that provides
		functionality for estimating the exact 95% confidence interval
		of the location parameter in the random effects model, and is
		much faster than the naive method. Works best when the number
		of studies is between 6-20.
