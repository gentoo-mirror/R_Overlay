		Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Stochastic
		Interventions // Efficient estimation of the population-level
		causal effects of stochastic interventions on a continuous-
		valued exposure. Both one-step and targeted minimum loss
		estimators are implemented for the counterfactual mean value of
		an outcome of interest under an additive modified treatment
		policy, a stochastic intervention that may depend on the
		natural value of the exposure. To accommodate settings with
		outcome-dependent two-phase sampling, procedures incorporating
		inverse probability of censoring weighting are provided to
		facilitate the construction of inefficient and efficient one-
		step and targeted minimum loss estimators.  The causal
		parameter and its estimation were first described by Daz and
		van der Laan (2013) doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01685.x, while
		the multiply robust estimation procedure and its application to
		data from two-phase sampling designs is detailed in NS Hejazi,
		MJ van der Laan, HE Janes, PB Gilbert, and DC Benkeser (2020)
		doi:10.1111/biom.13375. The software package implementation is
		described in NS Hejazi and DC Benkeser (2020)
		doi:10.21105/joss.02447. Estimation of nuisance parameters may
		be enhanced through the Super Learner ensemble model in 'sl3',
		available for download from GitHub using
		'remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3")'.
