		Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Stochastic
		Interventions // Efficient estimation of the population-level
		causal effects of stochastic interventions on a continuous-
		valued exposure. Both one-step and targeted minimum loss
		estimators are implemented for a causal parameter defined as
		the counterfactual mean of an outcome of interest under a
		stochastic intervention that may depend on the natural value of
		the exposure (i.e., a modified treatment policy). To
		accommodate settings in which two-phase sampling is employed,
		procedures for making use of inverse probability of censoring
		weights are provided to facilitate construction of inefficient
		and efficient one-step and targeted minimum loss estimators.
		The causal parameter and estimation methodology were first
		described by Daz and van der Laan (2013)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01685.x). Estimation of nuisance
		parameters may be enhanced through the Super Learner ensemble
		model in 'sl3', available for download from GitHub using
		'remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3")'.
