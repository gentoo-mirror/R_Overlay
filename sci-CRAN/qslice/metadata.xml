		Implementations of Various Slice Samplers // Implementations of
		the quantile slice sampler of Heiner et al. (2024+, in
		preparation) as well as other popular slice samplers are
		provided. Helper functions for specifying pseudo-target
		distributions are included, both for diagnostics and for tuning
		the quantile slice sampler. Other implemented methods include
		the generalized elliptical slice sampler of Nishihara et al.
		(2014)https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/nishihara14a.html}, latent
		slice sampler of Li and Walker
		(2023)doi:10.1016/j.csda.2022.107652, and stepping-out slice
		sampler of Neal (2003)doi:10.1214/aos/1056562461, and
		independence Metropolis-Hastings sampler.
