		Analysis of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Massively Parallel
		Sequencing (MPS) Data // Loading, identifying, aggregating,
		manipulating, and analysing short tandem repeat regions of
		massively parallel sequencing data in forensic genetics.
		'STRMPS' can work with the package 'STRaitRazoR' (an R
		interface to the 'STRaitRazor' commandline tool) for added
		speed. 'STRaitRazoR' only works on linux and can found at
		https://github.com/svilsen/STRaitRazoR. The analyses and
		framework implemented in this package relies on the papers of
		Vilsen et al. (2017) doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.01.017 and
		Vilsen et al. (2018) doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.04.003. Lastly,
		note that the parallelisation in the package relies on
		mclapply() and, thus, speed-ups will only be seen on UNIX based
		systems.
