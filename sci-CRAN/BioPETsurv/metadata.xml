		Biomarker Prognostic Enrichment Tool for Time-to-Event Trial //
		Prognostic Enrichment is a strategy of enriching a clinical
		trial for testing an intervention intended to prevent or delay
		an unwanted clinical event.  A prognostically enriched trial
		enrolls only patients who are more likely to experience the
		unwanted clinical event than the broader patient population (R.
		Temple (2010) doi:10.1038/clpt.2010.233). By testing the
		intervention in an enriched study population, the trial may be
		adequately powered with a smaller sample size, which can have
		both practical and ethical advantages. This package provides
		tools to evaluate biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of
		clinical trials with survival/time-to-event outcomes.
