		Einstein Summation // The summation notation suggested by
		Einstein (1916) doi:10.1002/andp.19163540702 is a concise
		mathematical notation that implicitly sums over repeated
		indices of n-dimensional arrays. Many ordinary matrix
		operations (e.g. transpose, matrix multiplication, scalar
		product, 'diag()', trace etc.) can be written using Einstein
		notation. The notation is particularly convenient for
		expressing operations on arrays with more than two dimensions
		because the respective operators ('tensor products') might not
		have a standardized name.
