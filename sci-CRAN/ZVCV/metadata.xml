		Zero-Variance Control Variates // Zero-variance control variates
		(ZV-CV, Mira et al. (2013) doi:10.1007/s11222-012-9344-6) is a
		post-processing method to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo
		estimators of expectations using the derivatives of the log
		target. Once the derivatives are available, the only additional
		computational effort is in solving a linear regression problem.
		Recently, this method has been extended to higher dimensions
		using regularisation (South et al., 2018 arXiv:1811.05073).
		This package can be used to easily perform ZV-CV or regularised
		ZV-CV when a set of samples, derivatives and function
		evaluations are available. Additional functions for applying
		ZV-CV to two estimators for the normalising constant of the
		posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics are also
		supplied.
