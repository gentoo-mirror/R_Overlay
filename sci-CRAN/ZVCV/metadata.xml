		Zero-Variance Control Variates // Stein control variates can be
		used to improve Monte Carlo estimates of expectations when the
		derivatives of the log target are available. This package
		implements a variety of such methods, including zero-variance
		control variates (ZV-CV, Mira et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-012-9344-6), regularised ZV-CV (South et
		al., 2018 arXiv:1811.05073), control functionals (CF, Oates et
		al. (2017) doi:10.1111/rssb.12185) and semi-exact control
		functionals (SECF, South et al., 2020 arXiv:2002.00033). ZV-CV
		is a parametric approach that is exact for (low order)
		polynomial integrands with Gaussian targets. CF is a non-
		parametric alternative that offers better than the standard
		Monte Carlo convergence rates. SECF has both a parametric and a
		non-parametric component and it offers the advantages of both
		for an additional computational cost. Functions for applying
		ZV-CV and CF to two estimators for the normalising constant of
		the posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics are also
		supplied in this package. The basic requirements for using the
		package are a set of samples, derivatives and function
		evaluations.
