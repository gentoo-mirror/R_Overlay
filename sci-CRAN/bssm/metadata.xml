		Bayesian Inference of Non-Linear and Non-Gaussian State Space
		Models // Efficient methods for Bayesian inference of state
		space models via particle Markov chain Monte Carlo and parallel
		importance sampling type weighted Markov chain Monte Carlo.
		Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, or negative binomial observation
		densities, stochastic volatility models with Gaussian state
		dynamics, as well as general non-linear Gaussian models and
		discretised diffusion models are supported.
