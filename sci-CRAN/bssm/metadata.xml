		Bayesian Inference of State Space Models // Efficient methods for
		Bayesian inference of state space models via particle Markov
		chain Monte Carlo and importance sampling type corrected Markov
		chain Monte Carlo. Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, or negative
		binomial observation densities and Gaussian state dynamics, as
		well as general non-linear Gaussian models are supported.
