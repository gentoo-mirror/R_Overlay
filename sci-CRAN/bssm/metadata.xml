		Bayesian Inference of Non-Gaussian State Space Models //
		Efficient methods for Bayesian inference of state space models
		via particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and MCMC based on
		parallel importance sampling type weighted estimators (Vihola,
		Helske, and Franks, 2020, doi:10.1111/sjos.12492). Gaussian,
		Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, and Gamma observation
		densities and basic stochastic volatility models with Gaussian
		state dynamics, as well as general non-linear Gaussian models
		and discretised diffusion models are supported.
