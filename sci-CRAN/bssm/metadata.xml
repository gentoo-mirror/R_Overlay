		Bayesian Inference of Non-Linear and Non-Gaussian State Space
		Models // Efficient methods for Bayesian inference of state
		space models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based on
		parallel importance sampling type weighted estimators (Vihola,
		Helske, and Franks, 2020, doi:10.1111/sjos.12492), particle
		MCMC, and its delayed acceptance version. Gaussian, Poisson,
		binomial, negative binomial, and Gamma observation densities
		and basic stochastic volatility models with linear-Gaussian
		state dynamics, as well as general non-linear Gaussian models
		and discretised diffusion models are supported. See Helske and
		Vihola (2021, doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-103) for details.
