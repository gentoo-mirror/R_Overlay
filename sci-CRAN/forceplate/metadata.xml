		Processing Force-Plate Data // Process raw force-plate data (txt-
		files) by segmenting them into trials and, if needed,
		calculating (user-defined) descriptive statistics of variables
		for user-defined time bins (relative to trigger onsets) for
		each trial. When segmenting the data a baseline correction, a
		filter, and a data imputation can be applied if needed.
		Experimental data can also be processed and combined with the
		segmented force-plate data. This procedure is suggested by
		Johannsen et al. (2023) doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.22190155 and
		some of the options (e.g., choice of low-pass filter) are also
		suggested by Winter (2009) doi:10.1002/9780470549148.
