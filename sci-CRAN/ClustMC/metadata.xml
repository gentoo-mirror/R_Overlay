		Cluster-Based Multiple Comparisons // Multiple comparison
		techniques are typically applied following an F test from an
		ANOVA to decide which means are significantly different from
		one another. As an alternative to traditional methods, cluster
		analysis can be performed to group the means of different
		treatments into non-overlapping clusters. Treatments in
		different groups are considered statistically different.
		Several approaches have been proposed, with varying clustering
		methods and cut-off criteria. This package implements cluster-
		based multiple comparisons tests and also provides a visual
		representation in the form of a dendrogram. Di Rienzo, J. A.,
