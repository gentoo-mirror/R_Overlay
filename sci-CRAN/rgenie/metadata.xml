		Analysis of GenIE Experiments // The R package for GenIE analysis
		is designed to analyze the next-generation sequencing output
		from a set of GenIE experimental replicates. GenIE (genome-
		editing interrogation of enhancers) is an experimental method
		to evaluate the effects of individual single-nucleotide
		polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene transcription. It is based on
		targeted CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in cultured cells to
		produce indels at a target locus, optionally with a homology-
		dependent recombination (HDR) construct to create precisely
		defined genomic changes. Following this, both genomic DNA
		(gDNA) and RNA are extracted from the same pool of cells, then
		complementary DNA (cDNA) is generated from the RNA. Both gDNA
		and cDNA are amplified with locus-specific PCR primers, in
		multiple replicates, and libraries of the experimental
		replicates are prepared for next-generation sequencing. The
		sequencing data from each replicate for each region should be
		aligned to either the full reference genome or to a locus-
		specific (amplicon) reference genome for analysis by 'rgenie'.
