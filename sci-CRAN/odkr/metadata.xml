		'Open Data Kit' ('ODK') R API // Utility functions for working
		with datasets gathered using 'Open Data Kit' ('ODK')
		https://opendatakit.org/. These include an API to interface
		with 'ODK Briefcase', a 'Java' application for fetching and
		pushing 'ODK' forms and their contents, that allows pulling of
		data from either a remote 'ODK Aggregate Server' or a local
		'ODK' folder, a rename function to give more human readable
		variable names for 'ODK' datasets, a merge function to create a
		single dataframe from a nested 'ODK' dataset and an expand
		function to disaggregate multiple choice answers that have been
		collapsed into single code by 'ODK'.
