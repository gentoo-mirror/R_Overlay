		Differential Risk Hotspots in a Linear Network // Performs the
		identification of differential risk hotspots given a marked
		point pattern (Diggle 2013) doi:10.1201/b15326 lying on a
		linear network (Baddeley, Rubak and Turner 2015)
		doi:10.1201/b19708. The algorithm makes use of a network-
		constrained version of kernel density estimation (McSwiggan,
		Baddeley and Nair 2017) doi:10.1111/sjos.12255, and then
		follows a statistical approach to approximate the probability
		of ocurrence across space for the type of event specified by
		the user through the marks of the pattern (Kelsall and Diggle
		1995) doi:10.2307/3318678. The final goal is to detect
		microzones of the road network where the type of event
		indicated by the user is overrepresented, considering the
		network structure provided.
