		Differential Risk Hotspots in a Linear Network // Performs the
		identification of differential risk hotspots (Briz-Redon et al.
		2019) doi:10.1016/j.aap.2019.105278 along a linear network.
		Given a marked point pattern lying on the linear network, the
		method implemented uses a network-constrained version of kernel
		density estimation (McSwiggan et al. 2017)
		doi:10.1111/sjos.12255 to approximate the probability of
		occurrence across space for the type of event specified by the
		user through the marks of the pattern (Kelsall and Diggle 1995)
		doi:10.2307/3318678. The goal is to detect microzones of the
		linear network where the type of event indicated by the user is
		overrepresented.
