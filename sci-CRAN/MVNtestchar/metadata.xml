		Test for Multivariate Normal Distribution Based on a
		Characterization // Provides a test of multivariate normality
		of an unknown sample that does not require estimation of the
		nuisance parameters, the mean and covariance matrix.  Rather, a
		sequence of transformations removes these nuisance parameters
		and results in a set of sample matrices that are positive
		definite.  These matrices are uniformly distributed on the
		space of positive definite matrices in the unit hyper-rectangle
		if and only if the original data is multivariate normal
		(Fairweather, 1973, Doctoral dissertation, University of
		Washington). The package performs a goodness of fit test of
		this hypothesis. In addition to the test, functions in the
		package give visualizations of the support region of positive
		definite matrices for bivariate samples.
