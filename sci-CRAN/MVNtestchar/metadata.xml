		Multivariate Normal Distribution Characterization Test //
		Provides a test of multivariate normality of a sample which
		does not require estimation of the nuisance parameters, the
		mean and covariance matrix.  Rather, a sequence of
		transformations removes these nuisance parameters and results
		in a set of sample matrices that are positive definite.  These
		matrices are uniformly distributed on the space of positive
		definite matrices in the unit hyperrectangle if and only if the
		original data is multivariate normal. The package performs a
		goodness of fit test of this hypothesis. Four sample datasets
		are included: a bivariate and a trivariate normal set and a
		bivariate and trivariate Bernoulli set. In addition to the
		test, functions in the package give rotatable visualizations of
		the support region of positive definite matrices for bivariate
		samples.
