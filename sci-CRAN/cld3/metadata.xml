		Google's Compact Language Detector 3 // Google's Compact Language
		Detector 3 is a neural network model for language
		identification and the successor of 'cld2' (available from
		CRAN). The algorithm is still experimental and takes a novel
		approach to language detection with different properties and
		outcomes. It can be useful to combine this with the Bayesian
		classifier results from 'cld2'. See
		https://github.com/google/cld3#readme for more information.
