		Historical Tree Ensembles for Longitudinal Data // Historical
		regression trees are an extension of standard trees, producing
		a non-parametric estimate of how the response depends on all of
		its prior realizations as well as that of any time-varying
		predictor variables. The method applies equally to regularly as
		well as irregularly sampled data. The package implements random
		forest and boosting ensembles based on historical regression
		trees, suitable for longitudinal data.
