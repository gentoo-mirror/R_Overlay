		Measuring Agreement Using Krippendorff's Alpha Coefficient //
		Provides tools for applying Krippendorff's Alpha methodology
		DOI:10.1080/19312450709336664. Both the customary methodology
		and Hughes' methodology DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2210.13265 are
		supported, the former being preferred for larger datasets, the
		latter for smaller datasets. The framework supports common and
		user-defined distance functions, and can accommodate any number
		of units, any number of coders, and missingness. Interval
		estimation can be done in parallel for either methodology.
