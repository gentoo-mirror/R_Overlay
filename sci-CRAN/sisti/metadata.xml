		Real-Time PCR Data Sets by Sisti et al. (2010) // This data
		package contains four datasets of quantitative PCR (qPCR)
		amplification curves that were used as supplementary data in
		the research article by Sisti et al. (2010),
		doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-186. The primary dataset comprises a
		ten-fold dilution series spanning copy numbers from 3.14  10^7
		to 3.14  10^2, with twelve replicates per concentration. These
		samples are based on a pGEM-T Promega plasmid containing a 104
		bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase 1 (MT-
		ND1), amplified using the ND1/ND2 primer pair. The remaining
		three datasets contain qPCR results in the presence of specific
		PCR inhibitors: tannic acid, immunoglobulin G (IgG), and
		quercetin, respectively, to assess their effects on the
		amplification process. These datasets are useful for
		researchers interested in PCR kinetics. The original raw data
		file is available as Additional File 1: https://static-content.
