		Construction of Selection Index // Selection index is one of the
		efficient and acurrate method for selection of animals. This
		package is useful for construction of selection indices. It
		uses mixed and random model least squares analysis to estimate
		the heritability of traits and genetic correlation between
		traits. The package uses the sire model as it is considered as
		random effect. The genetic and phenotypic (co)variances along
		with the relative economic values are used to construct the
		selection index for any number of traits. It also estimates the
		accuracy of the index and the genetic gain expected for
		different traits. Fisher (1936)
