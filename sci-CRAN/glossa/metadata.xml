		User-Friendly 'shiny' App for Bayesian Species Distribution
		Models // A user-friendly 'shiny' application for Bayesian
		machine learning analysis of marine species distributions.
		GLOSSA (Global Ocean Species Spatio-temporal Analysis) uses
		Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman, George, and
		McCulloch (2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285) to model species
		distributions with intuitive workflows for data upload,
		processing, model fitting, and result visualization. It
		supports presence-absence and presence-only data (with pseudo-
		absence generation), spatial thinning, cross-validation, and
		scenario-based projections. GLOSSA is designed to facilitate
		ecological research by providing easy-to-use tools for
		analyzing and visualizing marine species distributions across
		different spatial and temporal scales. Optionally, pseudo-
		absences can be generated within the environmental space using
		the external package 'flexsdm' (not on CRAN), which can be
		downloaded from https://github.com/sjevelazco/flexsdm; this
		functionality is used conditionally when available and all core
		features work without it.
