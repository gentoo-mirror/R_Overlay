		Blinding Assessment Indexes for Randomized, Controlled, Clinical
		Trials // Generate the James Blinding Index, as described in
		James et al (1996) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8841652/ and
		the Bang Blinding Index, as described in Bang et al (2004)
		https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15020033/. These are measures
		to assess whether or not satisfactory blinding has been
		maintained in a randomized, controlled, clinical trial. These
		can be generated for trial subjects, research coordinators and
		principal investigators, based upon standardized questionnaires
		that have been administered, to assess whether or not they can
		correctly guess to which treatment arm (e.g. placebo or
		treatment) subjects were assigned at randomization.
