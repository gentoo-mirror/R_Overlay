		Random Number Generation for Generalized Poisson Distribution //
		Generation of univariate and multivariate data that follow the
		generalized Poisson distribution. The details of the univariate
		part are explained in Demirtas (2017), and the multivariate
		part is an extension of the correlated Poisson data generation
		routine that was introduced in Yahav and Shmueli (2012).
