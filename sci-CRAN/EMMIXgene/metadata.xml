		A Mixture Model-Based Approach to the Clustering of Microarray
		Expression Data // Provides unsupervised selection and
		clustering of microarray data using mixture models. Following
		the methods described in McLachlan, Bean and Peel (2002)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.413 a subset of genes are
		selected based one the likelihood ratio statistic for the test
		of one versus two components when fitting mixtures of
		t-distributions to the expression data for each gene. The
		dimensionality of this gene subset is further reduced through
		the use of mixtures of factor analyzers, allowing the tissue
		samples to be clustered by fitting mixtures of normal
		distributions.
