		Equivalent Estimation Balanced Split Plot Designs // In
		agricultural, post-harvest and processing, engineering and
		industrial experiments factors are often differentiated with
		ease with which they can change from experimental run to
		experimental run. This is due to the fact that one or more
		factors may be expensive or time consuming to change i.e. hard-
		to-change factors. These factors restrict the use of complete
		randomization as it may make the experiment expensive and time
		consuming. Split plot designs can be used for such situations.
		In general model estimation of split plot designs require the
		use of generalized least squares (GLS). However for some split-
		plot designs ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are
		equivalent to generalized least squares (GLS) estimates. These
		types of designs are known in literature as equivalent-
		estimation split-plot design. For method details see, Macharia,
		H. and Goos, P.(2010)
		doi:10.1080/00224065.2010.11917833.Balanced split plot designs
		are designs which have an equal number of subplots within every
		whole plot. This package used to construct equivalent
		estimation balanced split plot designs for different
		experimental set ups along with different statistical criteria
		to measure the performance of these designs. It consist of the
		function equivalent_BSPD().
