		Flood Frequency Analysis Framework // Tools to support systematic
		and reproducible workflows for both stationary and
		nonstationary flood frequency analysis, with applications
		extending to other hydroclimate extremes, such as precipitation
		frequency analysis. This package implements the FFA framework
		proposed by Vidrio- Sahagn et al. (2024)
		doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.105940, originally developed in
		'MATLAB', now adapted for the 'R' environment. This work was
		funded by the Flood Hazard Identification and Mapping Program
		of Environment and Climate Change Canada, as well as the Canada
		Research Chair (Tier 1) awarded to Dr. Pietroniro.
