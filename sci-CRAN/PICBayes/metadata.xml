		Bayesian Models for Partly Interval-Censored Data // Contains
		functions to fit proportional hazards (PH) model to partly
		interval-censored (PIC) data (Pan et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1177/0962280220921552), PH model with spatial frailty to
		spatially dependent PIC data (Pan and Cai (2021)
		doi:10.1080/03610918.2020.1839497), and mixed effects PH model
		to clustered PIC data. Each random intercept/random effect can
		follow both a normal prior and a Dirichlet process mixture
		prior. It also includes the corresponding functions for general
		interval-censored data.
