		Derivatives of the Diffusion Density and Cumulative Distribution
		Function // Calculates the partial derivative of the first-
		passage time diffusion probability density function (PDF) and
		cumulative distribution function (CDF) with respect to the
		first-passage time t (only for PDF), the upper barrier a, the
		drift rate v, the relative starting point w, the non-decision
		time t0, the inter-trial variability of the drift rate sv, the
		inter-trial variability of the rel. starting point sw, and the
		inter-trial variability of the non-decision time st0. In
		addition the PDF and CDF themselves are also provided. Most
		calculations are done on the logarithmic scale to make it more
		stable. Since the PDF, CDF, and their derivatives are
		represented as infinite series, we give the user the option to
		control the approximation errors with the argument 'precision'.
		For the numerical integration we used the C library cubature by
		Johnson, S. G. (2005-2013)
		https://github.com/stevengj/cubature. Numerical integration is
		required whenever sv, sw, and/or st0 is not zero. Note that
		numerical integration reduces speed of the computation and the
		precision cannot be guaranteed anymore. Therefore, whenever
		numerical integration is used an estimate of the approximation
		error is provided in the output list.
