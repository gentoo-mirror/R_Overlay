		Generate Pizza Chart: Player Stats 0-100 // Create an interactive
		pizza chart visualizing a specific player's statistics across
		various attributes in a sports dataset. The chart is
		constructed based on input parameters: 'data', a dataframe
		containing player data for any sports; 'player_stats_col', a
		vector specifying the names of the columns from the dataframe
		that will be used to create slices in the pizza chart, with
		statistics ranging between 0 and 100; 'name_col', specifying
		the name of the column in the dataframe that contains the
		player names; and 'player_name', representing the specific
		player whose statistics will be visualized in the chart,
		serving as the chart title.
