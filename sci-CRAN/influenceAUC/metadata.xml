		Identify Influential Observations in Binary Classification // Ke,
		B. S., Chiang, A. J.,  Chang, Y. C. I. (2018)
		doi:10.1080/10543406.2017.1377728 provide two theoretical
		methods (influence function and local influence) based on the
		area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to
		quantify the numerical impact of each observation to the
		overall AUC. Alternative graphical tools, cumulative lift
		charts, are proposed to reveal the existences and approximate
		locations of those influential observations through data
		visualization.
