		Transformation Models with Mixed Effects // Likelihood-based
		estimation of mixed-effects transformation models using the
		Template Model Builder ('TMB', Kristensen et al., 2016,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i05). The technical details of
		transformation models are given in Hothorn et al. (2018,
		doi:10.1111/sjos.12291). Likelihood contributions of exact,
		randomly censored (left, right, interval) and truncated
		observations are supported. The random effects are assumed to
		be normally distributed on the scale of the transformation
		function, the marginal likelihood is evaluated using the
		Laplace approximation, and the gradients are calculated with
		automatic differentiation (Tamasi and Hothorn, 2021,
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-075). Penalized smooth shift terms can be
		defined using 'mgcv'.
