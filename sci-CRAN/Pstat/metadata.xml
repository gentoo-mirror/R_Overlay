		Assessing Pst Statistics // Calculating Pst values to assess
		differentiation among populations from a set of quantitative
		traits is the primary purpose of such a package. Pst value is
		an index that measures the level of phenotypic differentiation
		among populations (Leinonen et al., 2006). The bootstrap method
		provides confidence intervals and distribution histograms of
		Pst. Variations of Pst in function of the parameter c/h^2 are
		studied as well. Finally, the package proposes different
		transformations especially to eliminate any variation resulting
		from allometric growth (calculation of residuals from linear
		regressions, Reist standardizations or Aitchison
		transformation).
