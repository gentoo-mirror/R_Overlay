		Assessing Pst Statistics // Calculating Pst values to assess
		differentiation among populations from a set of quantitative
		traits is the primary purpose of such a package. The bootstrap
		method provides confidence intervals and distribution
		histograms of Pst. Variations of Pst in function of the
		parameter c/h^2 are studied as well. Finally, the package
		proposes different transformations especially to eliminate any
		variation resulting from allometric growth (calculation of
		residuals from linear regressions, Reist standardizations or
		Aitchison transformation).
