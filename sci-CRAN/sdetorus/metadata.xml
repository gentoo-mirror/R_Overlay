		Statistical Tools for Toroidal Diffusions // Implementation of
		statistical methods for the estimation of toroidal diffusions.
		Several diffusive models are provided, most of them belonging
		to the Langevin family of diffusions on the torus.
		Specifically, the wrapped normal and von Mises processes are
		included, which can be seen as toroidal analogues of the
		Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion. A collection of methods for
		approximate maximum likelihood estimation, organized in four
		blocks, is given: (i) based on the exact transition probability
		density, obtained as the numerical solution to the Fokker-Plank
		equation; (ii) based on wrapped pseudo-likelihoods; (iii) based
		on specific analytic approximations by wrapped processes; (iv)
		based on maximum likelihood of the stationary densities. The
		package allows the reproducibility of the results in Garca-
		Portugus et al. (2019) doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9790-2.
