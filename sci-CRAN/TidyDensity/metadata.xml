		Functions for Tidy Analysis of Randomly Generated Data // To make
		it easy to generate random numbers based upon the underlying
		stats distribution functions. All data is returned in a tidy
		and structured format making working with the data simple and
		straight forward. Given that the data is returned in a tidy
		'tibble' it lends itself to working with the rest of the
		'tidyverse'.
