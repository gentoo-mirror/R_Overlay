		Compositional Data Analysis in Practice // Univariate and
		multivariate methods for compositional data analysis, based on
		logratios. The package implements the approach in the book
		Compositional Data Analysis in Practice by Michael Greenacre
		(2018), where accent is given to simple pairwise logratios.
		Selection can be made of logratios that account for a maximum
		percentage of logratio variance. Various multivariate analyses
		of logratios are included in the package.
