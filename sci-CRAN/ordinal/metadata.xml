		Regression Models for Ordinal Data // Implementation of
		cumulative link (mixed) models also known as ordered regression
		models, proportional odds models, proportional hazards models
		for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/... models.
		Estimation is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are
		fitted with the Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-
		Hermite quadrature. Multiple random effect terms are allowed
		and they may be nested, crossed or partially nested/crossed.
		Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be imposed on the
		thresholds (cut-points/intercepts). Standard model methods are
		available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict
		etc.) in addition to profile methods and slice methods for
		visualizing the likelihood function and checking convergence.
