		Adaptive Weights Smoothing // We provide a collection of
		R-functions implementing adaptive smoothing procedures in 1D,
		2D and 3D. This includes the Propagation-Separation Approach to
		adaptive smoothing, the Intersecting Confidence Intervals
		(ICI), variational approaches and a non-local means filter. The
		package is described in detail in Polzehl J, Papafitsoros K,
		Tabelow K (2020). Patch-Wise Adaptive Weights Smoothing in R.
		Journal of Statistical Software, 95(6), 1-27.
		doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i06, Usage of the package in MR imaging
		is illustrated in Polzehl and Tabelow (2019), Magnetic
		Resonance Brain Imaging, Appendix A, Springer, Use R! Series.
