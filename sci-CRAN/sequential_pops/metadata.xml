		Sequential Analysis of Biological Population Sizes // In
		population management, data come at more or less regular
		intervals over time in sampling batches (bouts) and decisions
		should be made with the minimum number of samples and as
		quickly as possible. This package provides tools to implement,
		produce charts with stop lines, summarize results and assess
		sequential analyses that test hypotheses about population
		sizes. Two approaches are included: the sequential test of
		Bayesian posterior probabilities (Rincon, D.F. et al. 2025
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.70053), and the sequential probability
		ratio test (Wald, A. 1945 http://www.jstor.org/stable/2235829).
