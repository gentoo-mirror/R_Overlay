		Top-Down Time Ratio Segmentation for Coordinate Trajectories //
		Data collected on movement behavior is often in the form of
		time- stamped latitude/longitude coordinates sampled from the
		underlying movement behavior. These data can be compressed into
		a set of segments via the Top- Down Time Ratio Segmentation
		method described in Meratnia and de By (2004)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-540-24741-8_44 which, with some loss of
		information, can both reduce the size of the data as well as
		provide corrective smoothing mechanisms to help reduce the
		impact of measurement error.  This is an improvement on the
		well-known Douglas-Peucker algorithm for segmentation that
		operates not on the basis of perpendicular distances. Top-Down
		Time Ratio segmentation allows for disparate sampling time
		intervals by calculating the distance between locations and
		segments with respect to time. Provided a trajectory with
		timestamps, tdtr() returns a set of straight- line segments
		that can represent the full trajectory. McCool, Lugtig, and
		Schouten (2022) doi:10.1007/s11116-022-10328-2 describe this
		method as implemented here in more detail.
