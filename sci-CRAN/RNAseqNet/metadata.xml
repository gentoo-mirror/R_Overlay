		Log-Linear Poisson Graphical Model with Hot-Deck Multiple
		Imputation // Infer log-linear Poisson Graphical Model with an
		auxiliary data set. Hot-deck multiple imputation method is used
		to improve the reliability of the inference with an auxiliary
		dataset. Standard log-linear Poisson graphical model can also
		be used for the inference and the Stability Approach for
		Regularization Selection (StARS) is implemented to drive the
		selection of the regularization parameter.
