		Iterative Alternating Least Square Algorithm for Large-
		Dimensional Matrix Factor Model // The matrix factor model has
		drawn growing attention for its advantage in achieving two-
		directional dimension reduction simultaneously for matrix-
		structured observations. In contrast to the Principal Component
		Analysis (PCA)-based methods, we propose a simple Iterative
		Alternating Least Squares (IALS) algorithm for matrix factor
		models, see the details in He et al. (2023) arXiv:2301.00360.
