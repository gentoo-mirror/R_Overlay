		Weighted Nearest Neighbor Imputation of Missing Values using
		Selected Variables // New tools for the imputation of missing
		values in high-dimensional data are introduced using the non-
		parametric nearest neighbor methods. It includes weighted
		nearest neighbor imputation methods that use specific distances
		for selected variables. It includes an automatic procedure of
		cross validation and does not require prespecified values of
		the tuning parameters. It can be used to impute missing values
		in high-dimensional data when the sample size is smaller than
		the number of predictors. For more information see Faisal and
		Tutz (2017) doi:10.1515/sagmb-2015-0098.
