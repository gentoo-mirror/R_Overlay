		Computation and Visualisation of Atmospheric Convective
		Parameters // Collection of functions for rapid computation and
		visualisation of convective parameters commonly used in the
		operational prediction of severe convective storms. Core
		algorithm is based on a highly optimized 'C++' code linked into
		'R' via 'Rcpp'. Highly efficient engine allows to derive
		thermodynamic and kinematic parameters from large numerical
		datasets such as reanalyses or operational Numerical Weather
		Prediction models in a reasonable amount of time. Package has
		been developed since 2017 by research meteorologists
		specializing in severe thunderstorms.
