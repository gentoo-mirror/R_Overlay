		Analyse Eye Data // Enables the automation of actions across the
		pipeline, including initial steps of transforming binocular
		data and gap repair to event-based processing such as
		fixations, saccades, and entry/duration in Areas of Interest
		(AOIs). It also offers visualisation of eye movement and AOI
		entries. These tools take relatively raw (trial, time, x, and y
		form) data and can be used to return fixations, saccades, and
		AOI entries and time spent in AOIs. As the tools rely on this
		basic data format, the functions can work with data from any
		eye tracking device. Implements fixation and saccade detection
		using methods proposed by Salvucci and Goldberg (2000)
