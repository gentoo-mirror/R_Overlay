		Diagnostic Index Expectation Maximisation in R // Likelihood-
		based genome polarisation finds which alleles of genomic
		markers belong to which side of the barrier. Co-estimates which
		individuals belong to either side of the barrier and barrier
		strength. Uses expectation maximisation in likelihood
		framework. The method is described in Baird et al. (2023)
