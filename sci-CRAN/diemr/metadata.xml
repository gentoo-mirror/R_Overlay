		Genome Polarization via Diagnostic Index Expectation Maximization
		// Implements a likelihood-based method for genome
		polarization, identifying which alleles of SNV markers belong
		to either side of a barrier to gene flow. The approach co-
		estimates individual assignment, barrier strength, and
		divergence between sides, with direct application to studies of
		hybridization. Includes VCF-to-diem conversion and input
		checks, support for mixed ploidy and parallelization, and tools
		for visualization and diagnostic outputs. Based on diagnostic
		index expectation maximization as described in Baird et al.
