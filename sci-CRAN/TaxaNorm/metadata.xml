		Feature-Wise Normalization for Microbiome Sequencing Data // A
		novel feature-wise normalization method based on a zero-
		inflated negative binomial model. This method assumes that the
		effects of sequencing depth vary for each taxon on their mean
		and also incorporates a rational link of zero probability and
		taxon dispersion as a function of sequencing depth. Ziyue Wang,
