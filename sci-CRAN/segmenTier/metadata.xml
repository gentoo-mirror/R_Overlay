		Similarity-Based Segmentation of Multidimensional Signals // A
		dynamic programming solution to segmentation based on
		maximization of arbitrary similarity measures within segments.
		The general idea, theory and this implementation are described
		in Machne, Murray  Stadler (2017)
		doi:10.1038/s41598-017-12401-8. In addition to the core
		algorithm, the package provides time-series processing and
		clustering functions as described in the publication. These are
		generally applicable where a `k-means` clustering yields
		meaningful results, and have been specifically developed for
		clustering of the Discrete Fourier Transform of periodic gene
		expression data (`circadian' or `yeast metabolic
		oscillations'). This clustering approach is outlined in the
		supplemental material of Machne  Murray (2012)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037906), and here is used as a basis
		of segment similarity measures. Notably, the time-series
		processing and clustering functions can also be used as stand-
		alone tools, independent of segmentation, e.g., for
		transcriptome data already mapped to genes.
