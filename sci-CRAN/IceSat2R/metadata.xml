		ICESat-2 Altimeter Data using R // Programmatic connection to the
		'OpenAltimetry API' https://openaltimetry.earthdatacloud.nasa.g
		ov/data/openapi/swagger-ui/index.html/ to download and process
		'ATL03' (Global Geolocated Photon Data), 'ATL06' (Land Ice
		Height), 'ATL07' (Sea Ice Height), 'ATL08' (Land and Vegetation
		Height), 'ATL10' (Sea Ice Freeboard), 'ATL12' (Ocean Surface
		Height) and 'ATL13' (Inland Water Surface Height) 'ICESat-2'
		Altimeter Data. The user has the option to download the data by
		selecting a bounding box from a 1- or 5-degree grid globally
		utilizing a shiny application. The 'ICESat-2' mission collects
		altimetry data of the Earth's surface. The sole instrument on
		'ICESat-2' is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System
		(ATLAS) instrument that measures ice sheet elevation change and
		sea ice thickness, while also generating an estimate of global
		vegetation biomass. 'ICESat-2' continues the important
		observations of ice-sheet elevation change, sea-ice freeboard,
		and vegetation canopy height begun by 'ICESat' in 2003.
