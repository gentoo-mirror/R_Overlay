		Human Gene Annotation Data from 'Ensembl' // Gene information
		from 'Ensembl' genome builds 'GRCh38.p14' and 'GRCh37.p13' to
		use with the 'topr' package. The datasets were originally
		downloaded from https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current/gtf/homo_sa
		piens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.111.gtf.gz and https://ftp.ensembl.or
		g/pub/grch37/current/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.87.gt
		f.gz and converted into the format required by the 'topr'
		package. See https://github.com/totajuliusd/topr?tab=readme-ov-
		file#how-to-use-topr-with-other-species-than-human to see the
		required format.
