		Bayesian Inference with Laplace Approximations and P-Splines //
		Laplace approximations and penalized B-splines are combined for
		fast Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models. The routines
		can be used to fit survival models, especially proportional
		hazards and promotion time cure models (Gressani, O. and
		Lambert, P. (2018) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2018.02.007). The
		Laplace-P-spline methodology can also be implemented for
		inference in (generalized) additive models (Gressani, O. and
		Lambert, P. (2021) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2020.107088). See the
		associated website for more information and examples.
