		Construct and Compare scGRN from Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data
		// A workflow based on machine learning methods to construct
		and compare single-cell gene regulatory networks (scGRN) using
		single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected from different
		conditions. Uses principal component regression, tensor
		decomposition, and manifold alignment, to accurately identify
		even subtly shifted gene expression programs. See
		doi:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100139 for more details.
