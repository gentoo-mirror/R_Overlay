		Markowitz Criterion // The Markowitz criterion is a multicriteria
		decision-making method that stands out in risk and uncertainty
		analysis in contexts where probabilities are known. This
		approach represents an evolution of Pascal's criterion by
		incorporating the dimension of variability. In this framework,
		the expected value reflects the anticipated return, while the
		standard deviation serves as a measure of risk. The 'markowitz'
		package provides a practical and accessible tool for
		implementing this method, enabling researchers and
		professionals to perform analyses without complex calculations.
		Thus, the package facilitates the application of the Markowitz
		criterion. More details on the method can be found in Octave
		Jokung-Nguna (2001, ISBN 2100055372).
