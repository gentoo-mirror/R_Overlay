		Simulate Impact of Different Urban Policies Through a General
		Equilibrium Model // Develops a General Equilibrium (GE) Model,
		which estimates key variables such as wages, the number of
		residents and workers, the prices of the floor space, and its
		distribution between commercial and residential use, as in
		Ahlfeldt et al., (2015)
		https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA10876. By
		doing so, the model allows understanding the economic influence
		of different urban policies.
