		Create and Format Correlation Matrices // Create correlation (or
		partial correlation) matrices. Correlation matrices are
		formatted with significance stars based on user preferences.
		Matrices of coefficients, p-values, and number of pairwise
		observations are returned. Send resultant formatted matrices to
		the clipboard to be pasted into excel and other programs. A
		plot method allows users to visualize correlation matrices
		created with 'corx'.
