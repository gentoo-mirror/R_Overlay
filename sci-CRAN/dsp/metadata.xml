		Dynamic Shrinkage Process and Change Point Detection // Provides
		efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for
		dynamic shrinkage processes, which extend global-local
		shrinkage priors to the time series setting by allowing
		shrinkage to depend on its own past. These priors yield locally
		adaptive estimates, useful for time series and regression
		functions with irregular features. The package includes full
		MCMC implementations for trend filtering using dynamic
		shrinkage on signal differences, producing locally constant or
		linear fits with adaptive credible bands. Also included are
		models with static shrinkage and normal-inverse-Gamma priors
		for comparison. Additional tools cover dynamic regression with
		time-varying coefficients and B-spline models with shrinkage on
		basis differences, allowing for flexible curve-fitting with
		unequally spaced data. Some support for heteroscedastic errors,
		outlier detection, and change point estimation. Methods in this
		package are described in Kowal et al. (2019)
