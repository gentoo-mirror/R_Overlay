		'TRFLP' Analysis and Matching Package for R // Matching terminal
		restriction fragment length polymorphism ('TRFLP') profiles
		between unknown samples and a database of known samples.
		'TRAMPR' facilitates analysis of many unknown profiles at once,
		and provides tools for working directly with electrophoresis
		output through to generating summaries suitable for community
		analyses with R's rich set of statistical functions.  'TRAMPR'
		also resolves the issues of multiple 'TRFLP' profiles within a
		species, and shared 'TRFLP' profiles across species.
