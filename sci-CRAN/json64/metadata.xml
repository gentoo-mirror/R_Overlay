		A 'Base64' Encode/Decode Package with Support for JSON
		Output/Input and UTF-8 // Encode/Decode 'base64', with support
		for JSON format, using two functions: j_encode() and
		j_decode().    'Base64' is a group of similar binary-to-text
		encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string
		format by translating it into a radix-64 representation, used
		when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be
		stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal
		with textual data, ensuring that the data will remain intact
		and without modification during transport.
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
		US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/Base64_encoding_and_decoding    On
		the other side, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a
		lightweight data-interchange format. Easy to read, write, parse
		and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
		Programming Language. JSON is a text format that is completely
		language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to
		programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#,
		Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. JSON structure
		is built around name:value pairs and ordered list of values.
		https://www.json.org    The first function, j_encode(), let you
		transform a data.frame or list to a 'base64' encoded JSON (or
		JSON string).    The j_decode() function takes a 'base64'
		string (could be an encoded JSON) and transform it to a
		data.frame (or list, depending of the JSON structure).
