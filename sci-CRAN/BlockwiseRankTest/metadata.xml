		Block-Wise Rank in Similarity Graph Edge-Count Two-Sample Test
		(BRISE) // Implements the Block-wise Rank in Similarity Graph
		Edge-count test (BRISE), a rank-based two-sample test designed
		for block-wise missing data. The method constructs (pattern)
		pair-wise similarity graphs and derives quadratic test
		statistics with asymptotic chi-square distribution or
		permutation-based p-values. It provides both vectorized and
		congregated versions for flexible inference. The methodology is
		described in Zhang, Liang, Maile, and Zhou (2025)
