		Implements Generalized Meta-Analysis Using Iterated Reweighted
		Least Squares Algorithm // Generalized meta-analysis is a
		technique for estimating parameters associated with a multiple
		regression model through meta-analysis of studies which may
		have information only on partial sets of the regressors. It
		estimates the effects of each variable while fully adjusting
		for all other variables that are measured in at least one of
		the studies. Using algebraic relationships between regression
		parameters in different dimensions, a set of moment equations
		is specified for estimating the parameters of a maximal model
		through information available on sets of parameter estimates
		from a series of reduced models available from the different
		studies. The specification of the equations requires a
		reference dataset to estimate the joint distribution of the
		covariates. These equations are solved using the generalized
		method of moments approach, with the optimal weighting of the
		equations taking into account uncertainty associated with
		estimates of the parameters of the reduced models. The proposed
		framework is implemented using iterated reweighted least
		squares algorithm for fitting generalized linear regression
		models. For more details about the method, please see pre-print
		version of the manuscript on generalized meta-analysis by
		Prosenjit Kundu, Runlong Tang and Nilanjan Chatterjee (2018)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asz030.The current version (0.2.0) is
		updated to address some of the stability issues in the previous
		version (0.1).
