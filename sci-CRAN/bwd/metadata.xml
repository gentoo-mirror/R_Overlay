		Backward Procedure for Change-Point Detection // Implements a
		backward procedure for single and multiple change point
		detection proposed by Shin et al. arXiv:1812.10107. The
		backward approach is particularly useful to detect short and
		sparse signals which is common in copy number variation (CNV)
		detection.
