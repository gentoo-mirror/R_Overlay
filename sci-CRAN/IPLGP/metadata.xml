		Identification of Parental Lines via Genomic Prediction //
		Combining genomic prediction with Monte Carlo simulation, three
		different strategies are implemented to select parental lines
		for multiple traits in plant breeding. The selection strategies
		include (i) GEBV-O considers only genomic estimated breeding
		values (GEBVs) of the candidate individuals; (ii) GD-O
		considers only genomic diversity (GD) of the candidate
		individuals; and (iii) GEBV-GD considers both GEBV and GD. The
		above method can be seen in Chung PY, Liao CT (2020)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0243159. Multi-trait genomic best
		linear unbiased prediction (MT-GBLUP) model is used to
		simultaneously estimate GEBVs of the target traits, and then a
		selection index is adopted to evaluate the composite
		performance of an individual.
