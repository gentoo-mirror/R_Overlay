		Simulation of Pleiotropic, Linked and Epistatic Phenotypes // The
		number of studies involving correlated traits and the
		availability of tools to handle this type of data has increased
		considerably in the last decade. With such a demand, we need
		tools for testing hypotheses related to single and multi-trait
		(correlated) phenotypes based on many genetic settings. Thus,
		we implemented various options for simulation of pleiotropy and
		Linkage Disequilibrium under additive, dominance and epistatic
		models. The simulation currently takes a HapMap file as an
		input and numericalize it with GAPIT.numericalization Lipka et
		al. (2012) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts444. The numericalized
		dataset is then used by a framework adapted from Rice and Lipka
		(2019) doi:10.3835/plantgenome2018.07.0052 for simulating
		multiple traits.
