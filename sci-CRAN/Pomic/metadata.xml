		Pattern Oriented Modelling Information Criterion // Calculations
		of an information criterion are proposed to check the quality
		of simulations results of Agent-based models (ABM/IBM) or other
		non-linear rule-based models. The POMDEV measure (Pattern
		Oriented Modelling DEViance) is based on the Kullback-Leibler
		divergence and likelihood theory. It basically indicates the
		deviance of simulation results from field observations. Once
		POMDEV scores and metropolis-hasting sampling on different
		model versions are effectuated, POMIC scores (Pattern Oriented
		Modelling Information Criterion) can be calculated. This method
		could be further developed to incorporate multiple patterns
		assessment. Piou C, U Berger and V Grimm (2009)
