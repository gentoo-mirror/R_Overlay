		Performs Quality Control, Data Normalization, and Batch Effect
		Correction for 'NanoString nCounter' Data // Provides quality
		control (QC), normalization, and batch effect correction
		operations for 'NanoString nCounter' data, Talhouk et al.
		(2016) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0153844.  Various metrics are
		used to determine which samples passed or failed QC.  Gene
		expression should first be normalized to housekeeping genes,
		before a reference-based approach is used to adjust for batch
		effects.  Raw NanoString data can be imported in the form of
		Reporter Code Count (RCC) files.
