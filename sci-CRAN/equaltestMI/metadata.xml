		Examine Measurement Invariance via Equivalence Testing and
		Projection Method // Functions for examining measurement
		invariance via equivalence testing along with adjusted
		RMSEA(root mean square error of approximation; Steiger  Lind,
		1980) cutoff values. In particular, a projection-based method
		is implemented to test the equality of latent factor means
		across groups without assuming the equality of intercepts.
