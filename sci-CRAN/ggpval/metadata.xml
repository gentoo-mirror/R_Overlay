		Annotate Statistical Tests for 'ggplot2' // Automatically
		performs desired statistical tests (e.g. wilcox.test(),
		t.test()) to compare between groups, and adds the resulting
		p-values to the plot with an annotation bar. Visualizing group
		differences are frequently performed by boxplots, bar plots,
		etc. Statistical test results are often needed to be annotated
		on these plots. This package provides a convenient function
		that works on 'ggplot2' objects, performs the desired
		statistical test between groups of interest and annotates the
		test results on the plot.
