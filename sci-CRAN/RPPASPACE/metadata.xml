		Reverse-Phase Protein Array Super Position and Concentration
		Evaluation // Provides tools for the analysis of reverse-phase
		protein arrays (RPPAs), which are also known as 'tissue lysate
		arrays' or simply 'lysate arrays'. The package's primary
		purpose is to input a set of quantification files representing
		dilution series of samples and control points taken from
		scanned RPPA slides and determine a relative log concentration
		value for each valid dilution series present in each slide and
		provide graphical visualization of the input and output data
		and their relationships. Other optional features include
		generation of quality control scores for judging the quality of
		the input data, spatial adjustment of sample points based on
		controls added to the slides, and various types of
		normalization of calculated values across a set of slides. The
		package was derived from a previous package named SuperCurve.
		For a detailed description of data inputs and outputs, usage
		information, and a list of related papers describing methods
		used in the package please review the vignette
		'Guide_to_RPPASPACE'. 'RPPA SPACE: an R package for
		normalization and quantitation of Reverse-Phase Protein Array
		data'. Bioinformatics Nov 15;38(22):5131-5133. doi:
		10.1093/bioinformatics/btac665.
