		Causal Effects in Principal Strata Defined by Antidrug Antibodies
		// Bayesian models to estimate causal effects of biological
		treatments on time-to-event endpoints in clinical trials with
		principal strata defined by the occurrence of antidrug
		antibodies. The methodology is based on Frangakis and Rubin
		(2002) doi:10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.00021.x and Imbens and
		Rubin (1997) doi:10.1214/aos/1034276631, and here adapted to a
		specific time-to-event setting.
