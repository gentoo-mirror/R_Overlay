		MCMC Simulation and Convergence Evaluation using Entropy and
		Kullback-Leibler Divergence Estimation // Tools for Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and performance analysis.
		Simulate MCMC algorithms including adaptive MCMC, evaluate
		their convergence rate, and compare candidate MCMC algorithms
		for a same target density, based on entropy and Kullback-
		Leibler divergence criteria. MCMC algorithms can be simulated
		using provided functions, or imported from external codes. This
		package is based upon work starting with Chauveau, D. and
		Vandekerkhove, P. (2013) doi:10.1051/ps/2012004 and next
		articles.
