		Operational Research User Stories // A first implementation of
		automated parsing of user stories, when used to defined
		functional requirements for operational research mathematical
		models. It allows reading user stories, splitting them on the
		who-what-why template, and classifying them according to the
		parts of the mathematical model that they represent. Also
		provides semantic grouping of stories, for project management
		purposes.
