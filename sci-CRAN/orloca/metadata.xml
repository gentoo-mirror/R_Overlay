		Operations Research LOCational Analysis Models // Objects and
		methods to handle and solve the min-sum location problem, also
		known as Fermat-Weber problem. The min-sum location problem
		search for a point such that the weighted sum of the distances
		to the demand points are minimized. See "The Fermat-Weber
		location problem revisited" by Brimberg, Mathematical
		Programming, 1, pg. 71-76, 1995. DOI:10.1007/BF01592245.
		General global optimization algorithms are used to solve the
		problem, along with the adhoc Weiszfeld method, see "Sur le
		point pour lequel la Somme des distances de n points donnes est
		minimum", by Weiszfeld, Tohoku Mathematical Journal, First
		Series, 43, pg. 355-386, 1937.
