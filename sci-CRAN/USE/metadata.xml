		Uniform Sampling of the Environmental Space // Provides functions
		for uniform sampling of the environmental space, designed to
		assist species distribution modellers in gathering ecologically
		relevant pseudo-absence data. The method ensures balanced
		representation of environmental conditions and helps reduce
		sampling bias in model calibration. Based on the framework
		described by Da Re et al. (2023) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14209.
