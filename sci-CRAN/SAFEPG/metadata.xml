		A Novel SAFE Model for Predicting Climate-Related Extreme Losses
		// The goal of 'SAFEPG' is to predict climate-related extreme
		losses by fitting a frequency-severity model. It improves
		predictive performance by introducing a sign-aligned
		regularization term, which ensures consistent signs for the
		coefficients across the frequency and severity components. This
		enhancement not only increases model accuracy but also enhances
		its interpretability, making it more suitable for practical
		applications in risk assessment.
