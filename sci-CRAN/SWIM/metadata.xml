		Scenario Weights for Importance Measurement // An efficient
		sensitivity analysis for stochastic models based on Monte Carlo
		samples. Provides weights on simulated scenarios from a
		stochastic model, such that stressed random variables fulfil
		given probabilistic constraints (e.g. specified values for risk
		measures), under the new scenario weights. Scenario weights are
		selected by constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to
		the baseline model. The 'SWIM' package is based on Pesenti S.M,
		Millossovich P., Tsanakas A. (2019) "Reverse Sensitivity
		Testing: What does it take to break the model",
		openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/18896/.
