		Small Area Estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian Method //
		Provides several functions for area level of small area
		estimation using hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method with
		Univariate Normal distribution and Univariate Beta distribution
		for variables of interest. Some dataset produced by a data
		generation are also provided. The 'rjags' package is employed
		to obtain parameter estimates. Model-based estimators involves
		the HB estimators which include the mean and the variation of
		mean. For the reference, see Rao and Molina (2015)
