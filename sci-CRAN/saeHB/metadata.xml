		Small Area Estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian Method //
		Provides several functions for area level of small area
		estimation using hierarchical Bayesian (HB) methods with
		several univariate distributions for variables of interest. The
		dataset that is used in every function is generated accordingly
		in the Example. The 'rjags' package is employed to obtain
		parameter estimates. Model-based estimators involve the HB
		estimators which include the mean and the variation of mean.
