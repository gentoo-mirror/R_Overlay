		Small Area Estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian Method //
		Provides several functions for area level of small area
		estimation using hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method with several
		univariate distributions for variable of interest. The dataset
		that used in every function is generated accordingly in the
		Example. The 'rjags' package is employed to obtain parameter
		estimates. Model-based estimators involves the HB estimators
		which include the mean and the variation of mean. For the
		reference, see Rao and Molina (2015) doi:10.1002/9781118735855.
