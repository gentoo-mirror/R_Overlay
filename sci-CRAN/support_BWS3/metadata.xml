		Basic Functions for Supporting Case 3 Best-Worst Scaling //
		Provides basic functions that support an implementation of Case
		3 (multi-profile case) best-worst scaling (BWS). Case 3 BWS is
		a question-based survey method to elicit people's preferences
		for attribute levels. Case 3 BWS constructs various
		combinations of attribute levels (profiles) and then asks
		respondents to select the best and worst profiles in each
		choice set. A main function creates a dataset for Case 3 BWS
		analysis from the choice sets and the responses to the
		questions. For details on Case 3 BWS, see Louviere et al.
