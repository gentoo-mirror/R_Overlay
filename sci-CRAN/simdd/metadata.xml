		Simulation of Fisher Bingham and Related Directional
		Distributions // Simulation methods for the Fisher Bingham
		distribution on the unit sphere, the matrix Bingham
		distribution on a Grassmann manifold, the matrix Fisher
		distribution on SO(3), and the bivariate von Mises sine model
		on the torus. The methods use an acceptance/rejection
		simulation algorithm for the Bingham distribution and are
		described fully by Kent, Ganeiber and Mardia (2018)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1390468. These methods supersede
		earlier MCMC simulation methods and are more general than
		earlier simulation methods. The methods can be slower in
		specific situations where there are existing non-MCMC
		simulation methods (see Section 8 of Kent, Ganeiber and Mardia
		(2018) doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1390468 for further details).
