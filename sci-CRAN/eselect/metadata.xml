		Adaptive Clinical Trial Designs with Endpoint Selection and
		Sample Size Reassessment // Endpoint selection and sample size
		reassessment for multiple binary endpoints based on blinded
		and/or unblinded data. Trial design that allows an adaptive
		modification of the primary endpoint based on blinded
		information obtained at an interim analysis. The decision rule
		chooses the endpoint with the lower estimated required sample
		size. Additionally, the sample size is reassessed using the
		estimated event probabilities and correlation between
		endpoints. The implemented design is proposed in Bofill Roig,
		M., Gmez Melis, G., Posch, M., and Koenig, F. (2022).
