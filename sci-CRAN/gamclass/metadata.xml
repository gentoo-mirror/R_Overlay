		Functions and Data for a Course on Modern Regression and
		Classification // Functions and data are provided that support
		a course that emphasizes statistical issues of inference and
		generalizability. The functions are designed to make it
		straightforward to illustrate the use of cross-validation, the
		training/test approach, simulation, and model-based estimates
		of accuracy.  Methods considered are Generalized Additive
		Modeling, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Tree-
		based methods, and Random Forests.
