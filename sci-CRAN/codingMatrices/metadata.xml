		Alternative Factor Coding Matrices for Linear Model Formulae // A
		collection of coding functions as alternatives to the standard
		functions in the stats package, which have names starting with
		'contr.'.  Their main advantage is that they provide a
		consistent method for defining marginal effects in multi-way
		factorial models.  In a simple one-way ANOVA model the
		intercept term is always the simple average of the class means.
