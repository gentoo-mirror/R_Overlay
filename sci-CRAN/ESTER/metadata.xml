		Efficient Sequential Testing with Evidence Ratios // An
		implementation of sequential testing that uses evidence ratios
		computed from the weights of a set of models. These weights
		correspond either to Akaike weights computed from the Akaike
		Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information
		Criterion (BIC) and following Burnham  Anderson (2004,
		doi:10.1177/0049124104268644) recommendations, or to pseudo-BMA
		weights computed from the WAIC or the LOO-IC of models fitted
		with 'brms' and following Yao et al. (2017,
		arXiv:1704.02030v3).
