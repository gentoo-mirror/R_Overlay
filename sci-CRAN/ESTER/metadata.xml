		Efficient Sequential Testing with Evidence Ratios // An
		implementation of sequential testing that uses evidence ratios
		computed from the Akaike weights of a set of models. These
		weights are being computed using either the Akaike Information
		Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
		and following Burnham  Anderson (2004) recommendations.
