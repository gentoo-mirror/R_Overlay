		Simulator for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics // An
		independent, reproducible, and flexible Spatially Resolved
		Transcriptomics (SRT) simulation framework that can be used to
		facilitate the development of SRT analytical methods for a wide
		variety of SRT-specific analyses. It utilizes spatial
		localization information to simulate SRT expression count data
		in a reproducible and scalable fashion. Two major simulation
		schemes are implemented in 'SRTsim': reference-based and
		reference-free.
