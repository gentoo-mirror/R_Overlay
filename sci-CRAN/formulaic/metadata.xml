		Dynamic Generation and Quality Checks of Formula Objects // Many
		statistical models and analyses in R are implemented through
		formula objects. The formulaic package creates a unified
		approach for programmatically and dynamically generating
		formula objects. Users may specify the outcome and inputs of a
		model directly, search for variables to include based upon
		naming patterns, incorporate interactions, and identify
		variables to exclude. A wide range of quality checks are
		implemented to identify issues such as misspecified variables,
		duplication, a lack of contrast in the inputs, and a large
		number of levels in categorical data.  Variables that do not
		meet these quality checks can be automatically excluded from
		the model.  These issues are documented and reported in a
		manner that provides greater accountability and useful
		information to guide an investigation of the data.
