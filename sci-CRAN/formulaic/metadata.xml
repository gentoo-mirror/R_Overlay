		Create Formula // Create a dynamic formula with multiple
		features. It not only diminishes the time required for modeling
		and implementing, but also enriches the quality of the result.
		Many statistical models and analyses in 'R' are implemented
		through formula objects. The 'formulaic' package creates a
		unified approach for programmatically and dynamically
		generating formula objects in 'R'. Users may specify the inputs
		and outcomes of a model directly, search for variables to
		include based upon naming patterns, and identify variables to
		exclude. A wide range of quality checks are implemented to
		identify issues such as misspecified variables, duplication, a
		lack of contrast in the inputs, and a large number of levels in
		categorical data. These issues are documented and reported in a
		manner that provides greater accountability and useful
		information to guide an investigators choices in selecting
		features.
