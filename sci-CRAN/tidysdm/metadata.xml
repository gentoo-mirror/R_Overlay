		Species Distribution Models with Tidymodels // Fit species
		distribution models (SDMs) using the 'tidymodels' framework,
		which provides a standardised interface to define models and
		process their outputs. 'tidysdm' expands 'tidymodels' by
		providing methods for spatial objects, models and metrics
		specific to SDMs, as well as a number of specialised functions
		to process occurrences for contemporary and palaeo datasets.
		The full functionalities of the package are described in
		Leonardi et al. (2023) doi:10.1101/2023.07.24.550358.
