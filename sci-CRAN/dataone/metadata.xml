		R Interface to the DataONE REST API // Provides read and write
		access to data and metadata from the DataONE network
		https://www.dataone.org of data repositories. Each DataONE
		repository implements a consistent repository application
		programming interface. Users call methods in R to access these
		remote repository functions, such as methods to query the
		metadata catalog, get access to metadata for particular data
		packages, and read the data objects from the data repository.
		Users can also insert and update data objects on repositories
		that support these methods.
