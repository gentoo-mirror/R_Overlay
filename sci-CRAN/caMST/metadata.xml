		Mixed Computerized Adaptive Multistage Testing // Provides
		functions to more easily analyze computerized adaptive tests.
		Currently, functions for computerized adaptive tests (CAT),
		computer adaptive multistage tests (CMT), and mixed computer
		adaptive multistage tests (McaMST) utilizing CAT item-level
		adaptation for the initial stage and traditional MST module-
		level adaptation for the subsequent stages have been created,
		and a variation of Hybrid computer adaptive MST is planned as
		well. For an in-depth look at CAT and MST, see Weiss  Kingsbury
		(1984) doi:10.1111/j.1745-3984.1984.tb01040.x and Luecht
