		Fast Kalman Filtering Through Sequential Processing // Fast and
		flexible Kalman filtering and smoothing implementation
		utilizing sequential processing, designed for efficient
		parameter estimation through maximum likelihood estimation.
		Sequential processing is a univariate treatment of a
		multivariate series of observations and can benefit from
		computational efficiency over traditional Kalman filtering when
		independence is assumed in the variance of the disturbances of
		the measurement equation. Sequential processing is described in
		the textbook of Durbin and Koopman (2001,
		ISBN:978-0-19-964117-8). 'FKF.SP' was built upon the existing
		'FKF' package and is, in general, a faster Kalman
		filter/smoother.
