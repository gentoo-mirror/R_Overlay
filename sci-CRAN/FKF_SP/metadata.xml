		Fast Kalman Filtering Through Sequential Processing // Fast and
		flexible Kalman filtering implementation utilizing sequential
		processing, designed for efficient parameter estimation through
		maximum likelihood estimation. 'FKF.SP' was built upon the
		existing 'FKF' package and was designed to generally increase
		the computational efficiency of Kalman filtering when
		independence is assumed in the measurement error of
		observations. Sequential processing is described in the
		textbook of Durbin and Koopman (2001, ISBN:978-0-19-964117-8).
