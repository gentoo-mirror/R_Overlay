		Estimating Cell Type Composition from Methylation Sequencing Data
		// An implementation of Bisect, a method for inferring cell
		type composition of samples based on methylation sequencing
		data (Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing and Reduced
		Representation Sequencing). The method is specifically tailored
		for sequencing data, and therefore works better than methods
		developed for methylation arrays. It contains a supervised mode
		that requires a reference (the methylation probabilities in the
		pure cell types), and a semi-supervised mode, that requires
		cell counts for a subset of the samples, but does not require a
		reference.
