		Data Exchange Between R and 'LabKey' Server // The 'LabKey'
		client library for R makes it easy for R users to load live
		data from a 'LabKey' Server, https://www.labkey.com/, into the
		R environment for analysis, provided users have permissions to
		read the data. It also enables R users to insert, update, and
		delete records stored on a 'LabKey' Server, provided they have
		appropriate permissions to do so.
