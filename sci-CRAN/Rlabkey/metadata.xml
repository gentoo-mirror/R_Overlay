		Data Exchange Between R and LabKey Server // The LabKey client
		library for R makes it easy for R users to load live data from
		a LabKey Server, http://www.labkey.com/, into the R environment
		for analysis, provided users have permissions to read the data.
		It also enables R users to insert, update, and delete records
		stored on a LabKey Server, provided they have appropriate
		permissions to do so.
