		Build Machine Learning Models Like Using Python's Scikit-Learn
		Library in R // The idea is to provide a standard interface to
		users who use both R and Python for building machine learning
		models. This package provides a scikit-learn's fit, predict
		interface to train machine learning models in R faster.
