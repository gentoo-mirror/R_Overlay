		MCMC Sampling of Bayesian Linear Models via Summary Statistics //
		Methods for generating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		posterior samples of Bayesian linear regression model
		parameters that require only summary statistics of data as
		input. Summary statistics are useful for systems with very
		limited amounts of physical memory. The package provides two
		functions:  one function that computes summary statistics of
		data and one function that carries out the MCMC posterior
		sampling for Bayesian linear regression models where summary
		statistics are used as input. The function read.regress.data.ff
		utilizes the R package 'ff' to handle data sets that are too
		large to fit into a user's physical memory, by reading in data
		in chunks. See Miroshnikov, Savel'ev and Conlon (2015)
		arXiv:1503.00635.
