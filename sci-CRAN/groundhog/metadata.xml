		Version-Control for CRAN, GitHub, and GitLab Packages // Make R
		scripts reproducible, by ensuring that every time a given
		script is run, the same version of the used packages are loaded
		(instead of whichever version the user running the script
		happens to have installed). This is achieved by using the
		command groundhog.library() instead of the base command
		library(), and including a date in the call. The date is used
		to call on the same version of the package every time (the most
		recent version available at that date). Load packages  from
		CRAN, GitHub, or Gitlab.
