		Create Lightweight Schema.org Descriptions of Data // The goal of
		'dataspice' is to make it easier for researchers to create
		basic, lightweight, and concise metadata files for their
		datasets. These basic files can then be used to make useful
		information available during analysis, create a helpful dataset
		"README" webpage, and produce more complex metadata formats to
		aid dataset discovery. Metadata fields are based on the
		'Schema.org' and 'Ecological Metadata Language' standards.
