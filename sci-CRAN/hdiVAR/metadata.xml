		Statistical Inference for Noisy Vector Autoregression // The
		model is high-dimensional vector autoregression with
		measurement error, also known as linear gaussian state-space
		model. Provable sparse expectation-maximization algorithm is
		provided for the estimation of transition matrix and noise
		variances. Global and simultaneous testings are implemented for
		transition matrix with false discovery rate control. For more
		information, see the accompanying paper: Lyu, X., Kang, J.,
		Li, L. (2020). "Statistical inference for high-dimensional
		vector autoregression with measurement error", arXiv preprint
		arXiv:2009.08011.
