		Moment Corrected Correlation // A number of biomedical problems
		involve performing many hypothesis tests, with an attendant
		need to apply stringent thresholds. Often the data take the
		form of a series of predictor vectors, each of which must be
		compared with a single response vector, perhaps with nuisance
		covariates. Parametric tests of association are often used, but
		can result in inaccurate type I error at the extreme
		thresholds, even for large sample sizes. Furthermore, standard
		two-sided testing can reduce power compared to the doubled
		p-value, due to asymmetry in the null distribution. Exact
		(permutation) testing approaches are attractive, but can be
		computationally intensive and cumbersome. MCC is an
		approximation to exact association testing of two vectors that
		is accurate and fast enough for standard use in high-throughput
		settings, and can easily provide standard two-sided or doubled
		p-values.
