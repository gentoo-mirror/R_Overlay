		Interactively Explore Local Explanations with the Radial Tour //
		Given a non-linear model, calculate the local explanation. We
		purpose view the data space, explanation space, and model
		residuals as ensemble graphic interactive on a shiny
		application. After an observation of interest is identified,
		the normalized variable importance of the local explanation is
		used as a 1D projection basis. The support of the local
		explanation is then explored by changing the basis with the use
		of the radial tour doi:10.32614/RJ-2020-027;
