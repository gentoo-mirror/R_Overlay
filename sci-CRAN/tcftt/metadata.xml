		Two-Sample Tests for Skewed Data // The classical two-sample
		t-test works well for the normally distributed data or data
		with large sample size. The tcfu() and tt() tests implemented
		in this package provide better type-I-error control with more
		accurate power when testing the equality of two-sample means
		for skewed populations having unequal variances. These tests
		are especially useful when the sample sizes are moderate. The
		tcfu() uses the Cornish-Fisher expansion to achieve a better
		approximation to the true percentiles. The tt() provides
		transformations of the Welch's t-statistic so that the sampling
		distribution become more symmetric. For more technical details,
		please refer to Zhang (2019) http://hdl.handle.net/2097/40235.
