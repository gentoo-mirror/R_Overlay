		RNA Secondary Structure Module Mining, Comparison and Plotting //
		Provides function for RNA secondary structure plotting,
		comparison and module mining. Given a RNA secondary structure,
		you can obtain stem regions, hairpin loops, internal loops,
		bulge loops and multibranch loops of this RNA structure using
		this program. They are the basic modules of RNA secondary
		structure. For each module you get, you can use this program to
		label the RNA structure with a specific color. You can also use
		this program to compare two RNA secondary structures to get a
		score that represents similarity. Reference: Reuter JS, Mathews
