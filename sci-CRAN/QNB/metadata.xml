		Differential RNA Methylation Analysis for Count-Based Small-
		Sample Sequencing Data with a Quad-Negative Binomial Model //
		As a newly emerged research area, RNA epigenetics has drawn
		increasing attention recently for the participation of RNA
		methylation and other modifications in a number of crucial
		biological processes. Thanks to high throughput sequencing
		techniques, such as m6A-Seq, transcriptome-wide RNA methylation
		profile is now available in the form of count-based data, with
		which it is often of interests to study the dynamics in
		epitranscriptomic layer. However, the sample size of RNA
		methylation experiment is usually very small due to its costs;
		and additionally, there usually exist a large number of genes
		whose methylation level cannot be accurately estimated due to
		their low expression level, making differential RNA methylation
		analysis a difficult task. We present QNB, a statistical
		approach for differential RNA methylation analysis with count-
		based small-sample sequencing data. The method is based on 4
		independent negative binomial distributions with their
		variances and means linked by local regressions. QNB showed
		improved performance on simulated and real m6A-Seq datasets
		when compared with competing algorithms. And the QNB model is
		also applicable to other datasets related RNA modifications,
		including but not limited to RNA bisulfite sequencing, m1A-Seq,
		Par-CLIP, RIP-Seq, etc.Please don't hesitate to contact
