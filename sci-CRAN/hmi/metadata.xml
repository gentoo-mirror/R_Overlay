		Hierarchical Multiple Imputation // Runs single level and
		multilevel imputation models. The user just has to pass the
		data to the main function and, optionally, his analysis model.
		Basically the package then translates this analysis model into
		commands to impute the data according to it with functions from
		'mice', 'MCMCglmm' or routines build for this package.
