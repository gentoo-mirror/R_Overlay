		Hierarchical Multiple Imputation // Runs single level and
		multilevel imputation models as described in Speidel, Drechsler
		and Jolani (2020) doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i09. The user just has
		to pass the data to the main function and, optionally, his
		analysis model. Basically the package then translates this
		analysis model into commands to impute the data according to it
		with functions from 'mice', 'MCMCglmm' or routines build for
		this package.
