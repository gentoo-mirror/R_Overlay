		Principal Stratification Analysis in R // Estimating causal
		effects in the presence of post-treatment confounding using
		principal stratification. 'PStrata' allows for customized
		monotonicity assumptions and exclusion restriction assumptions,
		with automatic full Bayesian inference supported by 'Stan'. The
		main function to use in this package is PStrata(), which
		provides posterior estimates of principal causal effect with
		uncertainty quantification. Visualization tools are also
		provided for diagnosis and interpretation. See Liu and Li
		(2023) arXiv:2304.02740 for details.
