		Multi-Modal Similarity Matrix Joint Factorization // A new method
		to implement clustering from multiple modality data of certain
		samples, the function M2SMjF() jointly factorizes multiple
		similarity matrices into a shared sub-matrix and several
		modality private sub-matrices, which is further used for
		clustering. Along with this method, we also provide function to
		calculate the similarity matrix and function to evaluate the
		best cluster number from the original data.
