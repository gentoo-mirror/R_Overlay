		R and C++ Interfaces to 'spdlog' C++ Header Library for Logging
		// The mature and widely-used C++ logging library 'spdlog' by
		Gabi Melman provides many desirable features. This package
		bundles these header files for easy use by R packages from both
		their R and C or C++ code. Explicit use via 'LinkingTo:' is
		also supported. Also see the 'spdl' package which enhanced this
		package with a consistent R and C++ interface.
