		Weighted Cumulative Exposure Models // A flexible method for
		modeling cumulative effects of time-varying exposures, weighted
		according to their relative proximity in time, and represented
		by time-dependent covariates. The current implementation
		estimates the weight function in the Cox proportional hazards
		model. The function that assigns weights to doses taken in the
		past is estimated using cubic regression splines.
