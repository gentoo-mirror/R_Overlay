		Sparse Tropical Algebra // Some of the basic tropical algebra
		functionality is provided for sparse matrices by applying
		sparse matrix storage techniques. Some of these are addition
		and multiplication of vectors and matrices, dot product of the
		vectors in tropical form and some general equations are also
		solved using tropical algebra.
