		Interface to the 'Azure Maps' API // Provides a wrapper for the
		Microsoft 'Azure Maps' REST APIs
		https://learn.microsoft.com/en-
		us/rest/api/maps/route?view=rest-maps-2025-01-01, enabling
		users to access mapping and geospatial services directly from
		R. This package simplifies authenticating, building, and
		sending requests for services like route directions. It handles
		conversions between R objects (such as 'sf' objects) and the
		GeoJSON+JSON format required by the API, making it easier to
		integrate 'Azure Maps' into R-based data analysis workflows.
