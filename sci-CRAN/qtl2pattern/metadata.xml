		Pattern Support for 'qtl2' Package // Routines in 'qtl2' to study
		allele patterns in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping over a
		chromosome. Useful in crosses with more than two alleles to
		identify how sets of alleles, genetically different strands at
		the same locus, have different response levels. Plots show
		profiles over a chromosome. Can handle multiple traits
		together. See https://github.com/byandell/qtl2pattern.
