		Design of Risk Parity Portfolios // Fast design of risk parity
		portfolios for financial investment. The goal of the risk
		parity portfolio formulation is to equalize or distribute the
		risk contributions of the different assets, which is missing if
		we simply consider the overall volatility of the portfolio as
		in the mean-variance Markowitz portfolio. In addition to the
		vanilla formulation, where the risk contributions are perfectly
		equalized subject to no shortselling and budget constraints,
		many other formulations are considered that allow for box
		constraints and shortselling, as well as the inclusion of
		additional objectives like the expected return and overall
		variance. See vignette for a detailed documentation and
		comparison, with several illustrative examples. The package is
		based on the papers: Y. Feng, and D. P. Palomar (2015). SCRIP:
		Successive Convex Optimization Methods for Risk Parity
		Portfolio Design. IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, vol. 63,
		no. 19, pp. 5285-5300. doi:10.1109/TSP.2015.2452219. F. Spinu
