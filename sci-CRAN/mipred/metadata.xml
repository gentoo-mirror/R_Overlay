		Prediction using Multiple Imputation // Calibration of
		generalized linear models and Cox regression models for
		prediction using multiple imputation to account for missing
		values in the predictors as described in the paper by "Mertens,
		Banzato and de Wreede" (2018) arXiv:1810.05099. The methodology
		and calculations described in this paper are fully implemented
		in this package. The vignette describes all data analytic steps
		which allow users to replicate results using the package
		functions on the data analyzed in the paper or on their own
		data. Imputations are generated using the package 'mice'
		without using the outcomes of observations for which the
		predictions are generated. Two options are provided to generate
		predictions. The first is prediction-averaging of predictions
		calibrated from single models fitted on single imputed datasets
		within a set of multiple imputations. The second is application
		of the Rubin's rules pooled model. For both implementations,
		unobserved values in the predictor data of new observations for
		which the predictions are derived are automatically imputed.
		The package contains two basic functions. The first, mipred()
		generates predictions of outcome on new observations. The
		second, mipred.cv() generates cross-validated predictions with
		the methodology on existing data for which outcomes have
		already been observed. The present version is still in
		development and should support continuous, binary and counting
		outcomes, but we have only thoroughly checked performance for
		binary outcome logistic regression modeling. We will include
		the Cox regression extension later.
