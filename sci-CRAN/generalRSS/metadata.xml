		Statistical Tools for Balanced and Unbalanced Ranked Set Sampling
		// Ranked Set Sampling (RSS) is a stratified sampling method
		known for its efficiency compared to Simple Random Sampling
		(SRS). When sample allocation is equal across strata, it is
		referred to as balanced RSS (BRSS) whereas unequal allocation
		is called unbalanced RSS (URSS), which is particularly
		effective for asymmetric or skewed distributions. This package
		offers practical statistical tools and sampling methods for
		both BRSS and URSS, emphasizing flexible sampling designs and
		inference for population means, medians, proportions, and Area
		Under the Curve (AUC). It incorporates parametric and
		nonparametric tests, including empirical likelihood ratio (LR)
		methods. The package provides ranked set sampling methods from
		a given population, including sampling with imperfect ranking
		using auxiliary variables. Furthermore, it provides tools for
		efficient sample allocation in URSS, ensuring greater
		efficiency than SRS and BRSS. For more details, refer e.g. to
