		Image Annotation and Polygon Outlining using Free Drawing //
		Provides functions to create image annotations through polygon
		outlining. Annotator has the same function as
		'graphics::locator()' but achieves its purpose through drawing,
		rather than multiple mouse clicks. It is based on the
		'htmlwidgets' package and 'fabric.js' JavaScript library
		http://fabricjs.com/.
