		Read Tabular Data from Diverse Sources and Easily Make Them Tidy
		// Provides utilities to read, cells from complex tabular data
		and heuristic detection based 'structural assignment' of those
		cells to a columnar or tidy format. Read functionality has the
		ability to read structured, partially structured or
		unstructured tabular data from various types of documents. The
		'structural assignment' functionality has both supervised and
		unsupervised way of assigning cells data to columnar/tidy
		format. Multiple disconnected blocks of tables in a single
		sheet are also handled appropriately. These tools are suitable
		for unattended conversation of messy tables into a consumable
		format(usable for further analysis and data wrangling).
