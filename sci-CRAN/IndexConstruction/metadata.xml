		Index Construction for Time Series Data // Derivation of indexes
		for benchmarking purposes. A methodology with flexible number
		of constituents is implemented. Also functions for market
		capitalization and volume weighted indexes with fixed number of
		constituents are available. The main function of the package,
		indexComp(), provides the derived index, suitable for analysis
		purposes. The functions indexUpdate(), indexMemberSelection()
		and indexMembersUpdate() are components of indexComp() and
		enable one to construct and continuously update an index, e.g.
		for display on a website. The methodology behind the functions
		provided gets introduced in Trimborn and Haerdle (2018)
