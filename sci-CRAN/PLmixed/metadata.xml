		Estimate (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models with Factor Structures
		// Utilizes the 'lme4' and 'optimx' packages (previously the
		optim() function from 'stats') to estimate (generalized) linear
		mixed models (GLMM) with factor structures using a profile
		likelihood approach, as outlined in Jeon and Rabe-Hesketh
		(2012) doi:10.3102/1076998611417628 and Rockwood and Jeon
		(2019) doi:10.1080/00273171.2018.1516541. Factor analysis and
		item response models can be extended to allow for an arbitrary
		number of nested and crossed random effects, making it useful
		for multilevel and cross-classified models.
