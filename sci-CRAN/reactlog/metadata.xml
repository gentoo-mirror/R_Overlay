		Reactivity Visualizer for 'shiny' // Building interactive web
		applications with R is incredibly easy with 'shiny'. Behind the
		scenes, 'shiny' builds a reactive graph that can quickly become
		intertwined and difficult to debug. 'reactlog' (Schloerke 2019)
		doi:10.5281/zenodo.2591517 provides a visual insight into that
		black box of 'shiny' reactivity by constructing a directed
		dependency graph of the application's reactive state at any
		time point in a reactive recording.
