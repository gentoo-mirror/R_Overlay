		Distance Sampling Simulations // Performs distance sampling
		simulations. 'dsims' repeatedly generates instances of a user
		defined population within a given survey region. It then
		generates realisations of a survey design and simulates the
		detection process. The data are then analysed so that the
		results can be compared for accuracy and precision across all
		replications. This process allows users to optimise survey
		designs for their specific set of survey conditions. The
		effects of uncertainty in population distribution or parameters
		can be investigated under a number of simulations so that users
		can be confident that they have achieved a robust survey design
		before deploying vessels into the field. The distance sampling
		designs used in this package from 'dssd' are detailed in
		Chapter 7 of Advanced Distance Sampling, Buckland et. al.
		(2008, ISBN-13: 978-0199225873). General distance sampling
		methods are detailed in Introduction to Distance Sampling:
		Estimating Abundance of Biological Populations, Buckland et.
		al. (2004, ISBN-13: 978-0198509271). Find out more about
		estimating animal/plant abundance with distance sampling at
