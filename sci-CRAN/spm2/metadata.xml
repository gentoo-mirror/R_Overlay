		Spatial Predictive Modeling // An updated and extended version of
		'spm' package, by introducing some further novel functions for
		modern statistical methods (i.e., generalised linear models,
		glmnet, generalised least squares), support vector machine,
		kriging methods (i.e., simple kriging, universal kriging, block
		kriging, kriging with an external drift), and novel hybrid
		methods (228 hybrids plus numerous variants) of modern
		statistical methods or machine learning methods with
		mathematical and/or univariate geostatistical methods for
		spatial predictive modelling. For each method, two functions
		are provided, with one function for assessing the predictive
		errors and accuracy of the method based on cross-validation,
		and the other for generating spatial predictions. It also
		contains a couple of functions for data preparation and
		predictive accuracy assessment.
