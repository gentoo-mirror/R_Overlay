		Threshold Selection and Uncertainty for Extreme Value Analysis //
		Provides functions for the selection of thresholds for use in
		extreme value models, based mainly on the methodology in
		Northrop, Attalides and Jonathan (2017) doi:10.1111/rssc.12159.
		It also performs predictive inferences about future extreme
		values, based either on a single threshold or on a weighted
		average of inferences from multiple thresholds, using the
		'revdbayes' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=revdbayes. At the moment
		only the case where the data can be treated as independent
		identically distributed observations is considered. See the
		'threshr' website for more information, documentation and
		examples.
