		Manipulating DNA Sequences and Estimating Unambiguous Haplotype
		Network with Statistical Parsimony // Provides S4 classes and
		methods for reading and manipulating aligned DNA sequences,
		supporting an indel coding methods (only simple indel coding
		method is available in the current version), showing base
		substitutions and indels, calculating absolute pairwise
		distances between DNA sequences, and collapses identical DNA
		sequences into haplotypes or inferring haplotypes using user
		provided absolute pairwise character difference matrix.  This
		package also includes S4 classes and methods for estimating
		genealogical relationships among haplotypes using statistical
		parsimony and plotting parsimony networks.
