		Estimate the Correlation Between Two Irregular Climate Time
		Series // Estimate the correlation between two irregular time
		series that are not necessarily sampled on identical time
		points. This program is also applicable to the situation of two
		evenly spaced time series that are not on the same time grid.
		'BINCOR' is based on a novel estimation approach proposed by
		Mudelsee (2010, 2014) to estimate the correlation between two
		time series with different timescales. 'BINCOR' contains four
		functions: bin_cor() (the main function to build the binned
		time series), plot_ts() (to plot and compare the irregular and
		binned time series, cor_ts() (to estimate the correlation
		between the binned time series) and ccf_ts() (to estimate the
		cross-correlation between the binned time series).
