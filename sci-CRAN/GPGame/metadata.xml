		Solving Complex Game Problems using Gaussian Processes //
		Sequential strategies for finding a game equilibrium are
		proposed in a black-box setting (expensive pay-off evaluations,
		no derivatives). The algorithm handles noiseless or noisy
		evaluations. Two acquisition functions are available. Graphical
		outputs can be generated automatically.
