		Small Area Estimation: Time-Series Models // Time series area-
		level models for small area estimation. The package supplements
		the functionality of the sae package. Specifically, it includes
		EBLUP fitting of the Rao-Yu model in the original form without
		a spatial component. The package also offers a modified
		("dynamic") version of the Rao-Yu model, replacing the
		assumption of stationarity. Both univariate and multivariate
		applications are supported. Of particular note is the allowance
		for covariance of the area-level sample estimates over time, as
		encountered in rotating panel designs such as the U.S. National
		Crime Victimization Survey or present in a time-series of
		5-year estimates from the American Community Survey. Key
		references to the methods include J.N.K. Rao and I. Molina
