		A Concentration-Response Modeling Utility // The tcplfit2 R
		package performs basic concentration-response curve fitting.
		The original tcplFit() function in the tcpl R package performed
		basic concentration-response curvefitting to 3 models. With
		tcplfit2, the core tcpl concentration-response functionality
		has been expanded to process diverse high-throughput screen
		(HTS) data generated at the US Environmental Protection Agency,
		including targeted ToxCast, high-throughput transcriptomics
		(HTTr) and high-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP).
		tcplfit2 can be used independently to support analysis for
		diverse chemical screening efforts.
