		Concentration-Response Modeling of HTS or Transcriptomics Data //
		Performs the basic concentration response curve fitting used in
		the 'tcpl' package. It is a substitute for the original
		tcplFit() function (and sub-functions) and allows a wider
		variety of concentration-response models. All of the models
		included in the 'BMDExpress' package are now part of this
		package, and the output includes a calculation of the bmd
		(Benchmark Dose or concentration) value.
