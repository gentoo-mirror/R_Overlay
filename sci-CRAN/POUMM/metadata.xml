		The Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model // The
		Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model (POUMM) allows to
		estimate the phylogenetic heritability of continuous traits, to
		test hypotheses of neutral evolution versus stabilizing
		selection, to quantify the strength of stabilizing selection,
		to estimate measurement error and to make predictions about the
		evolution of a phenotype and phenotypic variation in a
		population. The package implements combined maximum likelihood
		and Bayesian inference of the univariate Phylogenetic Ornstein-
		Uhlenbeck Mixed Model, fast parallel likelihood calculation,
		maximum likelihood inference of the genotypic values at the
		tips, functions for summarizing and plotting traces and
		posterior samples, functions for simulation of a univariate
		continuous trait evolution model along a phylogenetic tree. So
		far, the package has been used for estimating the heritability
		of quantitative traits in macroevolutionary and epidemiological
		studies, see e.g. Bertels et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1093/molbev/msx246 and Mitov and Stadler (2018)
		doi:10.1093/molbev/msx328. The algorithm for parallel POUMM
		likelihood calculation has been published in Mitov and Stadler
		(2019) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13136.
