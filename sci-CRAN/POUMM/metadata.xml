		The Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model // The
		Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model (POUMM) allows to
		estimate the phylogenetic heritability of continuous traits, to
		test hypotheses of neutral evolution versus stabilizing
		selection, to quantify the strength of stabilizing selection,
		to estimate measurement error and to make predictions about the
		evolution of a phenotype and phenotypic variation in a
		population. The package implements combined maximum likelihood
		and Bayesian inference of the univariate Phylogenetic Ornstein-
		Uhlenbeck Mixed Model, fast parallel likelihood calculation,
		maximum likelihood inference of the genotypic values at the
		tips, functions for summarizing and plotting traces and
		posterior samples, functions for simulation of a univariate
		continuous trait evolution along a phylogenetic tree. A quick
		example on using the POUMM package can be found in the README.
		More elaborate examples and use-cases are provided in the
		vignette "A User Guide to The POUMM R-package".
