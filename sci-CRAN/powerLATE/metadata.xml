		Generalized Power Analysis for LATE // An implementation of the
		generalized power analysis for the local average treatment
		effect (LATE), proposed by Bansak (2020) doi:10.1214/19-STS732.
		Power analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also
		known as the complier average causal effect, or CACE), with
		calculations based on a test of the null hypothesis that the
		LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative. The method uses
		standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the
		power under minimal assumptions. Package allows users to
		recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable
		effect sizes. Package also allows users to work with absolute
		effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional
		assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate
		adjustment.
