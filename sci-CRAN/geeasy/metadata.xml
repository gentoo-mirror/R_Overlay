		Solve Generalized Estimating Equations for Clustered Data //
		Estimation of generalized linear models with
		correlated/clustered observations by use of generalized
		estimating equations (GEE). See e.g. Halekoh and Hjsgaard,
		(2005, doi:10.18637/jss.v015.i02), for details. Several types
		of clustering are supported, including exchangeable variance
		structures, AR1 structures, M-dependent, user-specified
		variance structures and more. The model fitting computations
		are performed using modified code from the 'geeM' package,
		while the interface and output objects have been written to
		resemble the 'geepack' package. The package also contains
		additional tools for working with and inspecting results from
		the 'geepack' package, e.g. a 'confint' method for 'geeglm'
		objects from 'geepack'.
