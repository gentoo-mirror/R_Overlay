		Joint Feature Screening via Sparse MLE // Variable selection
		techniques are essential tools for model selection and
		estimation in high-dimensional statistical models. Sparse
		Maximal Likelihood Estimator (SMLE) (Xu and Chen
		(2014)doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.879531) provides an efficient
		implementation for the joint feature screening method on high-
		dimensional generalized linear models. It also conducts a post-
		screening selection based on user-specified selection
		criterion. The algorithm uses iterative hard thresholding along
		with parallel computing.
