		Joint Feature Screening via Sparse MLE // Feature screening is a
		powerful tool in processing ultrahigh dimensional data. It
		attempts to screen out most irrelevant features in preparation
		for a more elaborate analysis. Xu and Chen
		(2014)doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.879531 proposed an effective
		screening method SMLE, which naturally incorporates the joint
		effects among features in the screening process. This package
		provides an efficient implementation of SMLE-screening for
		high-dimensional linear, logistic, and Poisson models. The
		package also provides a function for conducting accurate post-
		screening feature selection based on an iterative hard-
		thresholding procedure and a user-specified selection
		criterion.
