		Approximate String Matching, Fuzzy Text Search, and String
		Distance Functions // Implements an approximate string matching
		version of R's native 'match' function. Also offers fuzzy text
		search based on various string distance measures. Can calculate
		various string distances based on edits (Damerau-Levenshtein,
		Hamming, Levenshtein, optimal sting alignment), qgrams (q-
		gram, cosine, jaccard distance) or heuristic metrics (Jaro,
		Jaro-Winkler). An implementation of soundex is provided as
		well. Distances can be computed between character vectors while
		taking proper care of encoding or between integer vectors
		representing generic sequences. This package is built for speed
		and runs in parallel by using 'openMP'. An API for C or C++ is
		exposed as well.
