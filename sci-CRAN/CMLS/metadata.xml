		Constrained Multivariate Least Squares // Solves multivariate
		least squares (MLS) problems subject to constraints on the
		coefficients, e.g., non-negativity, orthogonality, equality,
		inequality, monotonicity, unimodality, smoothness, etc.
		Includes flexible functions for solving MLS problems subject to
		user-specified equality and/or inequality constraints, as well
		as a wrapper function that implements 24 common constraint
		options. Also does k-fold or generalized cross-validation to
		tune constraint options for MLS problems. See ten Berge (1993,
		ISBN:9789066950832) for an overview of MLS problems, and see
		Goldfarb and Idnani (1983) doi:10.1007/BF02591962 for a
		discussion of the underlying quadratic programming algorithm.
