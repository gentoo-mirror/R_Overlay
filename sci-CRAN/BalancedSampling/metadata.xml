		Balanced and Spatially Balanced Sampling // Select balanced and
		spatially balanced probability samples in multi-dimensional
		spaces with any prescribed inclusion probabilities. It contains
		fast (C++ via Rcpp) implementations of the included sampling
		methods. The local pivotal method by Grafstrm, Lundstrm and
		Schelin (2012) doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01699.x and
		spatially correlated Poisson sampling by Grafstrm (2012)
		doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2011.07.003 are included. Also the cube
		method (for balanced sampling) and the local cube method (for
		doubly balanced sampling) are included, see Grafstrm and Till
		(2013) doi:10.1002/env.2194.
