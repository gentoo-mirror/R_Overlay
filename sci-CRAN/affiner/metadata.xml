		A Finer Way to Render 3D Illustrated Objects in 'grid' Using
		Affine Transformations // Dilate, permute, project, reflect,
		rotate, shear, and translate 2D and 3D points.  Supports
		parallel projections including oblique projections such as the
		cabinet projection as well as axonometric projections such as
		the isometric projection.  Use 'grid's "affine transformation"
		feature to render illustrated flat surfaces.
