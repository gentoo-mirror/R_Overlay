		Mass Balance Reconstruction // Mass-balance-adjusted Regression
		algorithm for streamflow reconstruction at sub-annual
		resolution (e.g., seasonal or monthly). The algorithm
		implements a penalty term to minimize the differences between
		the total sub-annual flows and the annual flow. The method is
		described in Nguyen et al (2020) DOI:10.1002/essoar.10504791.1.
