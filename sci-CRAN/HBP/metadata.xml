		Hi-C BED File Analysis Pipeline // Hi-C dataset processing
		algorithm introduced by Chao He (2016) doi.org/10.1101/083576.
		The optimized and flexible pipeline for analyzing the folding
		of whole chromosome and interactions between some specific
		sites from the Hi-C raw sequencing reads to the partially
		processed datasets. The other complex genetic and epigenetic
		datasets from public sources such as GWAS, ENCODE consortiums
		etc. will also easily be integrated into HBP, hence the final
		output results of HBP could provide a comprehensive in-depth
		understanding for the specific chromatin interactions,
		potential molecular mechanisms and biological significance. We
		believe that HBP is a reliable tool for the rapidly analysis of
		Hi-C data and will be very useful for a wide range of
		researchers, particularly those who lack of background in
		computational biology.
