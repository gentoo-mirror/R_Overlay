		Functional Geostatistics: Univariate and Multivariate Functional
		Spatial Prediction // Performance of functional kriging,
		cokriging, optimal sampling and simulation for spatial
		prediction of functional data. The framework of spatial
		prediction, optimal sampling and simulation are extended from
		scalar to functional data. 'SpatFD' is based on the Karhunen-
		Love expansion that allows to represent the observed functions
		in terms of its empirical functional principal components.
		Based on this approach, the functional auto-covariances and
		cross-covariances required for  spatial functional predictions
		and optimal sampling, are completely determined by the sum of
		the spatial auto-covariances and cross-covariances of the
		respective score components. The package provides new classes
		of data and functions for modeling spatial dependence structure
		among curves. The spatial prediction of curves at unsampled
		locations can be carried out using two types of predictors, and
		both of them report, the respective variances of the prediction
		error. In addition, there is a function for the determination
		of spatial locations sampling configuration that ensures
		minimum variance of spatial functional prediction. There are
		also two functions for plotting predicted curves at each
		location and mapping the surface at each time point,
		respectively. References Bohorquez, M., Giraldo, R., and Mateu,
