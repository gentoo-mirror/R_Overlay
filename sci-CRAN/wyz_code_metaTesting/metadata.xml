		having to provide parameter values. Values will be generated,
		based on semantic naming of parameters as introduced by package

		and reused. Value generation logic can be completed with your
		own specific data types and generation schemes, to meet your
		requirements. Main benefits of 'wyz.code.metaTesting' is higher
		developer productivity, reduced time to production, and
		industrial inference testing. Refer to chapter 10 of Offensive
		Programming Book, Fabien GELINEAU (2019,
