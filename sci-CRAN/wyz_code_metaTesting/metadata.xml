		Wizardry Code Meta Testing // Meta testing is the ability to test
		a function without having to provide its parameter values.
		Those values will be generated, based on semantic naming of
		parameters, as introduced by package
		'wyz.code.offensiveProgramming'. Value generation logic can be
		completed with your own data types and generation schemes. This
		to meet your most specific requirements and to answer to a wide
		variety of usages, from general use case to very specific ones.
		While using meta testing, it becomes easier to generate stress
		test campaigns, non-regression test campaigns and robustness
		test campaigns, as generated tests can be saved and reused from
		session to session. Main benefits of using
		'wyz.code.metaTesting' is ability to discover valid and invalid
		function parameter combinations, ability to infer valid
		parameter values, and to provide smart summaries that allows
		you to focus on dysfunctional cases.
