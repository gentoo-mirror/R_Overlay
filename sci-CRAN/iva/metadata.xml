		Instrumental Variable Analysis in Case-Control Association
		Studies // Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is a special
		case of instrumental variable analysis with genetic
		instruments. It is used to estimate the unconfounded causal
		effect of an exposure. This package implements estimating and
		testing methods in Zhang et al. (2019) for MR analysis in case-
		control studies. It (1) estimates the causal effect of a
		quantitative exposure by the quasi empirical likelihood
		approach; (2) uses Lagrange multiplier test for testing the
		presence of causal; (3) provides a test for the presence of
		confounder.
