		A Collection of Process Capability Index Functions // A
		collection of process capability index functions, such as
		C_p(), C_pk(), C_pm(), and others, along with metadata about
		each, like 'LaTeX' equations and 'R' expressions. Its primary
		purpose is to form a foundation for other quality control
		packages to build on top of, by providing basic resources and
		functions. The indices belong to the field of statistical
		quality control, and quantify the degree to which a
		manufacturing process is able to create items that adhere to a
		certain standard of quality. For details see Montgomery, D. C.
		(2019, ISBN:978-1-119-39930-8).
