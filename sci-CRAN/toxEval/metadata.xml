		Exploring Biological Relevance of Environmental Chemistry
		Observations // Data analysis package for estimating potential
		biological effects from chemical concentrations in
		environmental samples. Included are a set of functions to
		analyze, visualize, and organize measured concentration data as
		it relates to user-selected chemical-biological interaction
		benchmark data such as water quality criteria. The intent of
		these analyses is to develop a better understanding of the
		potential biological relevance of environmental chemistry data.
		Results can be used to prioritize which chemicals at which
		sites may be of greatest concern. These methods are meant to be
		used as a screening technique to predict potential for
		biological influence from chemicals that ultimately need to be
		validated with direct biological assays. A description of the
		analysis can be found in Blackwell (2017)
