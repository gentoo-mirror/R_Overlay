		Local Correlation, Spatial Inequalities, Geographically Weighted
		Regression and Other Tools // The main purpose of lctools is to
		provide researchers and educators with easy-to-learn user
		friendly tools for calculating key spatial statistics and to
		apply simple as well as advanced methods of spatial analysis in
		real data. These include: Local Pearson and Geographically
		Weighted Pearson Correlation Coefficients, Spatial Inequality
		Measures (Gini, Spatial Gini, LQ, Focal LQ), Spatial
		Autocorrelation (Global and Local Moran's I), several
		Geographically Weighted Regression techniques and other Spatial
		Analysis tools (other geographically weighted statistics). This
		package also contains functions for measuring the significance
		of each statistic calculated, mainly based on Monte Carlo
		simulations.
