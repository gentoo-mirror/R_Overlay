		Local Correlation, Spatial Inequalities, Geographically Weighted
		Regression and Other Tools // Provides researchers and
		educators with easy-to-learn user friendly tools for
		calculating key spatial statistics and to apply simple as well
		as advanced methods of spatial analysis in real data. These
		include: Local Pearson and Geographically Weighted Pearson
		Correlation Coefficients, Spatial Inequality Measures (Gini,
		Spatial Gini, LQ, Focal LQ), Spatial Autocorrelation (Global
		and Local Moran's I), several Geographically Weighted
		Regression techniques and other Spatial Analysis tools (other
		geographically weighted statistics). This package also contains
		functions for measuring the significance of each statistic
		calculated, mainly based on Monte Carlo simulations.
