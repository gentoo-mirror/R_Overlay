		Create Simple Packages Which Do not Upset R Package Checks //
		Provides a function kitten() which creates cute little packages
		which pass R package checks. This sets it apart from
		package.skeleton() which it calls, and which leaves imperfect
		files behind. As this is not exactly helpful for beginners,
		kitten() offers an alternative. Unit test support is added if
		the 'tinytest' package is present.
