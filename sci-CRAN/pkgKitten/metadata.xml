		Create Simple Packages Which Do not Upset R Package Checks //
		Provides a function kitten() which creates cute little packages
		which pass R package checks. This sets it apart from
		package.skeleton() which it calls, and which leaves imperfect
		files behind. As this is not exactly helpful for beginners,
		kitten() offers an alternative.
