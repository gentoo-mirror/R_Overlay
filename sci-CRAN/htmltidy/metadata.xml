		Clean Up or Pretty Print Gnarly HTML and XHTML // HTML documents
		can be beautiful and pristine. They can also be wretched, evil,
		malformed demon-spawn. Now, you can tidy up that HTML and XHTML
		before processing it with your favorite angle-bracket crunching
		tools, going beyond the limited tidying that 'libxml2' affords
		in the 'XML' and 'xml2' packages and taming even the ugliest
		HTML code generated by the likes of Google Docs and Microsoft
		Word. It's also possible to use the functions provided to
		format or "pretty print" HTML content as it is being tidied.
