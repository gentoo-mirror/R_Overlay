		Tidy Up and Test XPath Queries on HTML and XML Content // HTML
		documents can be beautiful and pristine. They can also be
		wretched, evil, malformed demon-spawn. Now, you can tidy up
		that HTML and XHTML before processing it with your favorite
		angle-bracket crunching tools, going beyond the limited tidying
		that 'libxml2' affords in the 'XML' and 'xml2' packages and
		taming even the ugliest HTML code generated by the likes of
		Google Docs and Microsoft Word. It's also possible to use the
		functions provided to format or "pretty print" HTML content as
		it is being tidied. Utilities are also included that make it
		possible to view formatted and "pretty printed" HTML/XML
		content from HTML/XML document objects, nodes, node sets and
		plain character HTML/XML using 'vkbeautify' (by Vadim
		Kiryukhin) and 'highlight.js' (by Ivan Sagalaev). Also
		(optionally) enables filtering of nodes via XPath or viewing an
		HTML/XML document in "tree" view using 'XMLDisplay' (by Lev
		Muchnik). See https://github.com/vkiryukhin/vkBeautify and http
		://www.levmuchnik.net/Content/ProgrammingTips/WEB/XMLDisplay/Di
		splayXMLFileWithJavascript.html for more information about
		'vkbeautify' and 'XMLDisplay', respectively.
