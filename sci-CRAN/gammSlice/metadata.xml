		Generalized Additive Mixed Model Analysis via Slice Sampling //
		Uses a slice sampling-based Markov chain Monte Carlo to conduct
		Bayesian fitting and inference for generalized additive mixed
		models.  Generalized linear mixed models and generalized
		additive models are also handled as special cases of
		generalized additive mixed models. The methodology and software
		is described in Pham, T.H. and Wand, M.P. (2018). Australian
		and New Zealand Journal of Statistics (in press).
