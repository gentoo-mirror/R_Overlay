		Converts 'Monolix' Models to 'rxode2' // 'Monolix' is a tool for
		running mixed effects model using 'saem'. This tool allows you
		to convert 'Monolix' models to 'rxode2' (Wang, Hallow and James
		(2016) doi:10.1002/psp4.12052) using the form compatible with
		'nlmixr2' (Fidler et al (2019) doi:10.1002/psp4.12445). If
		available, the 'rxode2' model will read in the 'Monolix' data
		and compare the simulation for the population model individual
		model and residual model to immediately show how well the
		translation is performing. This saves the model development
		time for people who are creating an 'rxode2' model manually.
		Additionally, this package reads in all the information to
		allow simulation with uncertainty (that is the number of
		observations, the number of subjects, and the covariance
		matrix) with a 'rxode2' model.  This is complementary to the
		'babelmixr2' package that translates 'nlmixr2' models to
		'Monolix' and can convert the objects converted from
		'monolix2rx' to a full 'nlmixr2' fit. While not required, you
		can  get/install the 'lixoftConnectors' package in the
		'Monolix' installation, as described at the following url
		https://monolixsuite.slp-
		software.com/r-functions/2024R1/installation-and-
		initialization. When 'lixoftConnectors' is available, 'Monolix'
		can be used to load its model library instead manually setting
		up text files (which only works with old versions of
		'Monolix').
