		Multivariate Regression Association Measure // Implementations of
		an estimator for the multivariate regression association
		measure (MRAM) proposed in Shih and Chen (2025) in revision and
		its associated variable selection algorithm. The MRAM
		quantifies the predictability of a random vector Y from a
		random vector X given a random vector Z. It takes the maximum
		value 1 if and only if Y is almost surely a measurable function
		of X and Z, and the minimum value of 0 if Y is conditionally
		independent of X given Z. The MRAM generalizes the Kendall's
		tau copula correlation ratio proposed in Shih and Emura (2021)
		doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2020.104708 by employing the spatial sign
		function. The estimator is based on the nearest neighbor
		method, and the associated variable selection algorithm is
		adapted from the feature ordering by conditional independence
		(FOCI) algorithm of Azadkia and Chatterjee (2021)
		doi:10.1214/21-AOS2073. For further details, see the paper Shih
		and Chen (2025) in revision.
