		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons // Implementation of the
		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons (GPC) as defined in Buyse
		(2010) doi:10.1002/sim.3923 for complete observations, and
		extended in Peron (2018) doi:10.1177/0962280216658320 to deal
		with right-censoring. GPC compare two groups of observations
		(intervention vs. control group) regarding several prioritized
		endpoints to estimate the probability that a random observation
		drawn from one group performs better than a random observation
		drawn from the other group. The net benefit and win ratio
		statistics, i.e. the difference and ratio between the
		probabilities relative to the intervention and control groups,
		can then be estimated. Confidence intervals and p-values are
		obtained using permutations, a non-parametric bootstrap, or the
		asymptotic theory. The software enables the use of thresholds
		of minimal importance difference, stratification, non-
		prioritized endpoints (O'Brien test), and corrections to deal
		with missing values.
