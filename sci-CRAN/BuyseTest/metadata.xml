		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons // Implementation of the
		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons (GPC). GPC compare two groups
		of observations (intervention vs. control group) regarding
		several prioritized endpoints. The net benefit and win ratio
		statistics can then be estimated and corresponding confidence
		intervals and p-values can be estimated using resampling
		methods or the asymptotic U-statistic theory. The software
		enables the use of thresholds of minimal important difference
		as well as stratification. Censored observations can be handled
		using Gehan's modification of the Wilcoxon statistic, inverse
		probability of censoring weights, or, in the case of right
		censoring, using the empirical survival curves in each group to
		estimating the expected score of the censored pairs.
