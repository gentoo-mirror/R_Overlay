		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons // Implementation of the
		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons (GPC). GPC compare two groups
		of observations (intervention vs. control group) regarding
		several prioritized endpoints. The net benefit and win ratio
		statistics can then be estimated and corresponding confidence
		intervals and p-values can be estimated using resampling
		methods or the asymptotic U-statistic theory. The software
		enables the use of thresholds of minimal importance difference,
		stratification, and corrections to deal with right-censored
		endpoints or missing values.
