		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons // Implementation of the
		Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. This test enables to compare
		two groups of observations in randomized trials(e.g treated vs.
		control patients) on several prioritized outcomes. Pairwise
		comparisons require consideration of all possible pairs of
		individuals, one taken from the treatment group and the other
		taken from the control group. The outcomes of the two
		individuals forming a pair are compared. Thresholds of minimal
		clinically significant differences can be defined. It is
		possible to analyze simultaneously several outcomes by
		prioritizing the variables that capture them. The highest
		priority is assigned to the variable considered the most
		clinically relevant. A natural way of handling uninformative or
		neutral pairs is to consider the outcomes in descending order
		of priority: whenever a pair is uninformative or neutral for an
		outcome of higher priority, the outcomes of lower priority are
		examined In the case of time-to-event endpoint, four methods to
		handle censored observations are available in this package
		(Gehan, Peto, Efron, and Peron).
