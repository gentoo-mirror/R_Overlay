		Early Testing for a Treatment Effect using Surrogate Marker
		Information // Provides functions to test for a treatment
		effect in terms of the difference in survival between a
		treatment group and a control group using surrogate marker
		information obtained at some early time point in a time-to-
		event outcome setting. Nonparametric kernel estimation is used
		to estimate the test statistic and perturbation resampling is
		used for variance estimation. More details will be available in
		the future in: Parast L, Cai T, Tian L (2017) "Using a
		Surrogate Marker for Early Testing of a Treatment Effect"
		(under review).
