		Inferential Methods for Multimodal and Other Networks // A set of
		tools for testing networks. It includes functions for
		univariate and multivariate conditional uniform graph and
		quadratic assignment procedure testing, and network regression.
		The package is a complement to 'Multimodal Political Networks'
		(2021, ISBN:9781108985000), and includes various datasets used
		in the book. Built on the 'manynet' package, all functions
		operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and
		'tidygraph' objects, and on one-mode and two-mode (bipartite)
		networks.
