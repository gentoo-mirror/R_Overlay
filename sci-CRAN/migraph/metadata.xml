		Multimodal Network Analysis and More // A set of tools for
		analysing multimodal networks. It includes functions for
		measuring centrality, centralization, cohesion, closure,
		constraint and diversity, as well as for network block-
		modelling, regression, and diffusion models. The package is
		released as a complement to 'Multimodal Political Networks'
		(2021, ISBN:9781108985000), and includes various datasets used
		in the book. Built on the 'manynet' package, all functions
		operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and
		'tidygraph' objects, and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and
		sometimes three-mode networks.
