		Tools for Multimodal Network Analysis // A set of tools for
		analysing multimodal networks. All functions operate with
		matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph'
		objects, and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes
		three-mode networks. It includes functions for measuring
		centrality, centralization, cohesion, closure, and constraint,
		as well as for network block-modelling, regression, and
		diffusion models. The package is released as a complement to
		'Multimodal Political Networks' (2021, ISBN:9781108985000), and
		includes various datasets used in the book in addition to other
		network data.
