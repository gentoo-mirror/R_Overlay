		Multimodal and Multilevel Network Analysis // A set of tools that
		extend common social network analysis packages for analysing
		multimodal and multilevel networks. It includes functions for
		one- and two-mode (and sometimes three-mode) centrality,
		centralization, clustering, and constraint, as well as for one-
		and two-mode network regression and block-modelling. All
		functions operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph',
		'network'/'sna', and 'tidygraph' objects. The package is
		released as a complement to 'Multimodal Political Networks'
		(2021, ISBN:9781108985000), and includes various datasets used
		in the book.
