		Kriging Method for Spatial Functional Data // A Kriging method
		for functional datasets with spatial dependency. This
		functional Kriging method avoids the need to estimate the
		trace-variogram, and the curve is estimated by minimizing a
		quadratic form. The curves in the functional dataset are
		smoothed using Fourier series. The functional Kriging of this
		package is a modification of the method proposed by Giraldo
		(2011) doi:10.1007/s10651-010-0143-y.
