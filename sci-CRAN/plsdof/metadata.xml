		Degrees of Freedom and Statistical Inference for Partial Least
		Squares Regression // The plsdof package provides Degrees of
		Freedom estimates for Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression.
		Model selection for PLS is based on various information
		criteria (aic, bic, gmdl) or on cross-validation. Estimates for
		the mean and covariance of the PLS regression coefficients are
		available. They allow the construction of approximate
		confidence intervals and the application of test procedures.
		Further, cross-validation procedures for Ridge Regression and
		Principal Components Regression are available.
