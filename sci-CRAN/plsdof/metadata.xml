		Degrees of Freedom and Statistical Inference for Partial Least
		Squares Regression // The plsdof package provides Degrees of
		Freedom estimates for Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression.
		Model selection for PLS is based on various information
		criteria (aic, bic, gmdl) or on cross-validation. Estimates for
		the mean and covariance of the PLS regression coefficients are
		available. They allow the construction of approximate
		confidence intervals and the application of test procedures
		(Kramer and Sugiyama 2012 doi:10.1198/jasa.2011.tm10107).
		Further, cross-validation procedures for Ridge Regression and
		Principal Components Regression are available.
