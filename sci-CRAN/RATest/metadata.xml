		Randomization Tests // A collection of randomization tests, data
		sets and examples. The current version focuses on three testing
		problems and their implementation in empirical work. First, it
		facilitates the empirical researcher to test for particular
		hypotheses, such as comparisons of means, medians, and
		variances from k populations using robust permutation tests,
		which asymptotic validity holds under very weak assumptions,
		while retaining the exact rejection probability in finite
		samples when the underlying distributions are identical.
		Second, the description and implementation of a permutation
		test for testing the continuity assumption of the baseline
		covariates in the sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD)
		as in Canay and Kamat (2017) https://goo.gl/UZFqt7. More
		specifically, it allows the user to select a set of covariates
		and test the aforementioned hypothesis using a permutation test
		based on the Cramer-von Miss test statistic. Graphical
		inspection of the empirical CDF and histograms for the
		variables of interest is also supported in the package. Third,
		it provides the practitioner with an effortless implementation
		of a permutation test based on the martingale decomposition of
		the empirical process for the goodness-of-fit testing problem
		with an estimated nuisance parameter. An application of this
		testing problem is the one of testing for heterogeneous
		treatment effects in a randomized control trial.
