		Randomization Tests // A collection of randomization tests, data
		sets and examples. The current version focuses on five testing
		problems and their implementation in empirical work. First, it
		facilitates the empirical researcher to test for particular
		hypotheses, such as comparisons of means, medians, and
		variances from k populations using robust permutation tests,
		which asymptotic validity holds under very weak assumptions,
		while retaining the exact rejection probability in finite
		samples when the underlying distributions are identical.
		Second, the description and implementation of a permutation
		test for testing the continuity assumption of the baseline
		covariates in the sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD)
		as in Canay and Kamat (2018) https://goo.gl/UZFqt7. More
		specifically, it allows the user to select a set of covariates
		and test the aforementioned hypothesis using a permutation test
		based on the Cramer-von Misses test statistic. Graphical
		inspection of the empirical CDF and histograms for the
		variables of interest is also supported in the package. Third,
		it provides the practitioner with an effortless implementation
		of a permutation test based on the martingale decomposition of
		the empirical process for testing for heterogeneous treatment
		effects in the presence of an estimated nuisance parameter as
		in Chung and Olivares (2021) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.015.
		Fourth, this version considers the two-sample goodness-of-fit
		testing problem under covariate adaptive randomization and
		implements a permutation test based on a prepivoted Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov test statistic. Lastly, it implements an asymptotically
		valid permutation test based on the quantile process for the
		hypothesis of constant quantile treatment effects in the
		presence of an estimated nuisance parameter.
