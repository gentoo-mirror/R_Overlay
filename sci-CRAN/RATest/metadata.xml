		Randomization Tests // A collection of randomization tests, data
		sets and examples. The current version focuses on the
		description and implementation of a permutation test for
		testing the continuity assumption of the baseline covariates in
		the sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) as in Canay and
		Kamat (2017) https://goo.gl/UZFqt7. More specifically, it
		allows the user to select a set of covariates and test the
		aforementioned hypothesis using a permutation test based on the
		Cramer-von Miss test statistic. Graphical inspection of the
		empirical CDF and histograms for the variables of interest is
		also supported in the package.
