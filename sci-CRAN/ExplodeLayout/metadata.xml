		Calculate Exploded Coordinates Based on Original Node Coordinates
		and Node Clustering Membership // Current layout algorithms
		such as Kamada Kawai do not take into consideration disjoint
		clusters in a network, often resulting in a high overlap among
		the clusters, resulting in a visual hairball that often is
		uninterpretable. The ExplodeLayout algorithm takes as input (1)
		an edge list of a unipartite or bipartite network, (2) node
		layout coordinates (x, y) generated by a layout algorithm such
		as Kamada Kawai, (3) node cluster membership generated from a
		clustering algorithm such as modularity maximization, and (4) a
		radius to enable the node clusters to be exploded to reduce
		their overlap. The algorithm uses these inputs to generate new
		layout coordinates of the nodes which explodes the clusters
		apart, such that the edge lengths within the clusters are
		preserved, while the edge lengths between clusters are
		recalculated. The modified network layout with nodes and edges
		are displayed in two dimensions. The user can experiment with
		different explode radii to generate a layout which has
		sufficient separation of clusters, while reducing the overall
		layout size of the network. This package is a basic version of
		an earlier version called [epl]https://github.com/UTMB-DIVA-
		Lab/epl that searched for an optimal explode radius, and
		offered multiple ways to separate clusters in a network
		(Bhavnani et al(2017) PMID: 28815099). The example dataset is
		for a bipartite network, but the algorithm can work also for
		unipartite networks.
