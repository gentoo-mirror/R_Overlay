		Longitudinal Decomposition of Health Expectancy by Age and Cause
		// Provides tools to decompose differences in cohort health
		expectancy (HE) by age and cause using longitudinal data. The
		package implements a novel longitudinal attribution method
		based on a semiparametric additive hazards model with time-
		dependent covariates, specifically designed to address interval
		censoring and semi-competing risks via a copula framework. The
		resulting age-cause-specific contributions to disability
		prevalence and death probability can be used to quantify and
		decompose differences in cohort HE between groups. The package
		supports stepwise replacement decomposition algorithms and is
		applicable to cohort-based health disparity research across
		diverse populations. Related methods include Sun et al. (2023)
