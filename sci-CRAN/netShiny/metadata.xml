		Tool for Comparison and Visualization of Multiple Networks // We
		developed a comprehensive tool that helps with visualization
		and analysis of networks with the same variables across
		multiple factor levels. The 'netShiny' contains most of the
		popular network features such as centrality measures,
		modularity, and other summary statistics (e.g. clustering
		coefficient). It also contains known tools to look at the
		(dis)similarities between two networks, such as pairwise
		distance measures between networks, set operations on the nodes
		of the networks, distribution of the weights of the edges and a
		network representing the difference between two correlation
		matrices. The package 'netShiny' also contains tools to perform
		bootstrapping and find clusters in networks. See the 'netShiny'
		manual for more information, documentation and examples.
