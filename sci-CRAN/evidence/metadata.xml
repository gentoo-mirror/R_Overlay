		Analysis of Scientific Evidence Using Bayesian and Likelihood
		Methods // Bayesian (and some likelihoodist) functions as
		alternatives to hypothesis-testing functions in R base using a
		user interface patterned after those of R's hypothesis testing
		functions. See McElreath (2016, ISBN: 978-1-4822-5344-3),
		Gelman and Hill (2007, ISBN: 0-521-68689-X) (new edition in
		preparation) and Albert (2009, ISBN: 978-0-387-71384-7) for
		good introductions to Bayesian analysis and Pawitan (2002,
		ISBN: 0-19-850765-8) for the Likelihood approach.  The
		functions in the package also make extensive use of graphical
		displays for data exploration and model comparison.
