		A Tool for Phenotypic Data Processing // Large-scale phenotypic
		data processing is essential in research. Researchers need to
		eliminate outliers from the data in order to obtain true and
		reliable results. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a
		standard method for estimating random effects of a mixed model.
		This method can be used to process phenotypic data under
		different conditions and is widely used in animal and plant
		breeding. The 'Phenotype' can remove outliers from phenotypic
		data and performs the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP),
		help researchers quickly complete phenotypic data analysis.
