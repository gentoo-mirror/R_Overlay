		Graph-Constrained Regression with Enhanced Regularization
		Parameters Selection // Provides graph-constrained regression
		methods in which regularization parameters are selected
		automatically via estimation of equivalent Linear Mixed Model
		formulation. 'riPEER' (ridgified Partially Empirical
		Eigenvectors for Regression) method employs a penalty term
		being a linear combination of graph-originated and ridge-
		originated penalty terms, whose two regularization parameters
		are ML estimators from corresponding Linear Mixed Model
		solution; a graph-originated penalty term allows imposing
		similarity between coefficients based on graph information
		given whereas additional ridge-originated penalty term
		facilitates parameters estimation: it reduces computational
		issues arising from singularity in a graph-originated penalty
		matrix and yields plausible results in situations when graph
		information is not informative. 'riPEERc' (ridgified Partially
		Empirical Eigenvectors for Regression with constant) method
		utilizes addition of a diagonal matrix multiplied by a
		predefined (small) scalar to handle the non-invertibility of a
		graph Laplacian matrix. 'vrPEER' (variable reducted PEER)
		method performs variable-reduction procedure to handle the non-
		invertibility of a graph Laplacian matrix.
