		Test for Gene x Gene Interactions in Bi-Parental Populations //
		Provides functions to test for gene x gene interactions in a
		bi-parental population of inbred lines. The data are fitted
		with the mixed linear model described in Rio et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1101/2022.12.18.520958, that accounts for gene x gene
		interactions at both the fixed effect and variance levels. The
		package also provides graphical tools to display the gene x
		gene interaction trend at the mean level and the variance
		component analysis.
