		Adaptive and Automatic Gradient Boosting Computations // Fast and
		automatic gradient tree boosting designed to avoid manual
		tuning and cross-validation by utilizing an information
		theoretic approach. This makes the algorithm adaptive to the
		dataset at hand; it is completely automatic, and with minimal
		worries of overfitting. Consequently, the speed-ups relative to
		state-of-the-art implementations can be in the thousands while
		mathematical and technical knowledge required on the user are
		minimized.
