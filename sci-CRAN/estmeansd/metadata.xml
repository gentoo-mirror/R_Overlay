		Estimating the Sample Mean and Standard Deviation from Commonly
		Reported Quantiles in Meta-Analysis // Implements the methods
		of McGrath et al. (2020) doi:10.1177/0962280219889080 and Cai
		et al. (2021) doi:10.1177/09622802211047348 for estimating the
		sample mean and standard deviation from commonly reported
		quantiles in meta-analysis. These methods can be applied to
		studies that report the sample median, sample size, and one or
		both of (i) the sample minimum and maximum values and (ii) the
		first and third quartiles.
