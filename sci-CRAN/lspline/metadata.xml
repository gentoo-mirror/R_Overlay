		Linear Splines with Convenient Parametrisations // Linear splines
		with convenient parametrisations such that (1) coefficients are
		slopes of consecutive segments or (2) coefficients are slope
		changes at consecutive knots. Knots can be set manually or at
		break points of equal-frequency or equal-width intervals
		covering the range of 'x'. The implementation follows Greene
		(2003), chapter 7.2.5.
