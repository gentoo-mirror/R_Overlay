		Simulating Phylogenetic Trees under a General Model with or
		without Shifts // Provides a flexible simulation tool for
		phylogenetic trees under a general model for speciation and
		extinction. Trees with a user-specified number of extant tips,
		or a user-specified stem age are simulated. It is possible to
		assume any probability distribution for the waiting time until
		speciation and extinction. Furthermore, the waiting times to
		speciation / extinction may be scaled in different parts of the
		tree, meaning we can simulate trees with clade-dependent
		diversification processes. At a speciation event, one species
		splits into two. We allow for two different modes at these
		splits: (i) symmetric, where for every speciation event new
		waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for
		both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation
		event results in one species with new waiting times, and
		another that carries the extinction time and age of its
		ancestor. The symmetric mode can be seen as an vicariant or
		allopatric process where divided populations suffer equal
		evolutionary forces while the asymmetric mode could be seen as
		a peripatric speciation where a mother lineage continues to
		exist.
