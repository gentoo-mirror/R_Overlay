		Functions to Perform Hierarchical Analysis of Distance Sampling
		Data // Functions for performing hierarchical analysis of
		distance sampling data, with ability to use an areal spatial
		ICAR model on top of user supplied covariates to get at
		variation in abundance intensity.  The detection model can be
		specified as a function of observer and individual covariates,
		where a parametric model is supposed for the population level
		distribution of covariate values. The model uses data
		augmentation and a reversible jump MCMC algorithm to sample
		animals that were never observed.  Also included is the ability
		to include point independence (increasing correlation multiple
		observer's observations as a function of distance, with
		independence assumed for distance=0 or first distance bin), as
		well as the ability to model species misclassification rates
		using a multinomial logit formulation on data from double
		observers.  There is also the the ability to include zero
		inflation, but this is only recommended for cases where sample
		sizes and spatial coverage of the survey are high.
