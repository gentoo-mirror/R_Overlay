		Easy Loading and Installing of Packages // Easily load and
		install multiple packages from different sources, including
		CRAN and GitHub. The libraries function allows you to load or
		attach multiple packages in the same function call. The
		packages function will load one or more packages, and install
		any packages that are not installed on your system (after
		prompting you). Also included is a from_import function that
		allows you to import specific functions from a package into the
		global environment.
