		Robust Gene-Environment Interaction Analysis // Description: For
		the risk, progression, and response to treatment of many
		complex diseases, it has been increasingly recognized that
		gene-environment interactions play important roles beyond the
		main genetic and environmental effects. In practical
		interaction analyses, outliers in response variables and
		covariates are not uncommon. In addition, missingness in
		environmental factors is routinely encountered in
		epidemiological studies. The developed package consists of five
		robust approaches to address the outliers problems, among which
		two approaches can also accommodate missingness in
		environmental factors. Both continuous and right censored
		responses are considered. The proposed approaches are based on
		penalization and sparse boosting techniques for identifying
		important interactions, which are realized using efficient
		algorithms. Beyond the gene-environment analysis, the developed
		package can also be adopted to conduct analysis on interactions
		between other types of low-dimensional and high-dimensional
		data. (Mengyun Wu et al (2017),
