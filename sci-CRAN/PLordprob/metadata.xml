		Multivariate Ordered Probit Model via Pairwise Likelihood //
		Multivariate ordered probit model, i.e. the extension of the
		scalar ordered probit model where the observed variables have
		dimension greater than one. Estimation of the parameters is
		done via maximization of the pairwise likelihood, a special
		case of the composite likelihood obtained as product of
		bivariate marginal distributions. The package uses the Fortran
		77 subroutine SADMVN by Alan Genz, with minor adaptations made
		by Adelchi Azzalini in his "mvnormt" package for evaluating the
		two-dimensional Gaussian integrals involved in the pairwise
		log-likelihood. Optimization of the latter objective function
		is performed via quasi-Newton box-constrained optimization
		algorithm, as implemented in nlminb.
