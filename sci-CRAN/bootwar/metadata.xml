		Nonparametric Bootstrap Test with Pooled Resampling Card Game //
		The card game War is simple in its rules but can be lengthy. In
		another domain, the nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled
		resampling (nbpr) methods, as outlined in Dwivedi,
		Mallawaarachchi, and Alvarado (2017) doi:10.1002/sim.7263, is
		optimal for comparing paired or unpaired means in non-normal
		data, especially for small sample size studies. However, many
		researchers are unfamiliar with these methods. The 'bootwar'
		package bridges this gap by enabling users to grasp the
		concepts of nbpr via Boot War, a variation of the card game War
		designed for small samples. With the shuffle_cards() function,
		players can engage in Boot War using a standard 52-card deck, a
		custom deck created via an anonymous function, or interleaved
		custom decks where each player has their distinct deck. The
		package further provides functions like deal_card(),
		score_keeper(), and play_round() to streamline gameplay and
		scoring. Once a predetermined number of rounds concludes, users
		can employ the analyze_game() function to derive game results.
		This function leverages the 'npboottprm' package's nonparboot()
		to report nbpr results and, for comparative analysis, also
		reports results from the 'stats' package's t.test() function.
		Additionally, 'bootwar' features an interactive 'shiny' web
		application, bootwar(). This offers a user-centric interface to
		experience Boot War, enhancing understanding of nbpr methods
		across various distributions, sample sizes, number of bootstrap
		resamples, and confidence intervals.
