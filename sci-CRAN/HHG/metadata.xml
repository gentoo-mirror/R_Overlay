		Heller-Heller-Gorfine Tests of Independence and Equality of
		Distributions // Heller-Heller-Gorfine tests are a set of
		powerful statistical tests of multivariate k-sample homogeneity
		and independence (Heller et. al., 2013,
		doi:10.1093/biomet/ass070). For the univariate case, the
		package also offers implementations of the 'MinP DDP' and 'MinP
		ADP' tests by Heller et. al. (2016), which are consistent
		against all continuous alternatives but are distribution-free,
		and are thus much faster to apply.
