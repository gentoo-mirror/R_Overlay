		Efficient Constrained Based Modelling in R // This Systems
		Biology Library for R implements algorithms for constraint
		based analyses of metabolic networks (e.g. flux-balance
		analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA),
		regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM), robustness analysis and
		flux variability analysis). Most of the current LP/MILP solvers
		are supported via additional packages.
