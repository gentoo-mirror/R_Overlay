		Efficient Constrained Based Modelling // This Systems Biology
		Package (Gelius-Dietrich et. al. (2012)
		doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-125) implements algorithms for
		constraint based analyses of metabolic networks, e.g. flux-
		balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment
		(MOMA), regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM), robustness
		analysis and flux variability analysis. The package is easily
		extendable for additional algorithms. Most of the current
		LP/MILP solvers are supported via additional packages.
