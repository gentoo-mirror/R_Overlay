		A Set of Tools for Calculating Spatial Synchrony Between Tree-
		Ring Chronologies // Provides functions for the calculation and
		plotting of synchrony in tree growth from tree-ring width
		chronologies (TRW index). It combines variance-covariance
		(VCOV) mixed modelling with functions that quantify the degree
		to which the TRW chronologies contain a common temporal signal.
		It also implements temporal trends in spatial synchrony using a
		moving window. These methods can also be used with other kind
		of ecological variables that have temporal autocorrelation
		corrected.
