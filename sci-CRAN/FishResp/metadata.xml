		An Analytical Tool for Aquatic Respirometry // Calculates
		metabolic rate of fish and other aquatic organisms measured
		using an intermittent-flow respirometry approach. The tool is
		used to run a set of graphical QC tests of raw respirometry
		data, correct it for background respiration and chamber effect,
		filter and extract target values of absolute and mass-specific
		metabolic rate. Experimental design should include background
		respiration tests and measuring of one or two metabolic rate
		traits. The package allows a user to import raw respirometry
		data obtained from 'AutoResp' (see http://www.loligosystems.com
		for more information) or other logger software.
