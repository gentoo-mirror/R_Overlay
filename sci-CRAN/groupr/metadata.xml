		Groups with Inapplicable Values // The 'groupr' package provides
		a more powerful version of grouped tibbles from 'dplyr'. It
		allows groups to be marked inapplicable, which is a simple but
		widely useful way to express structure in a dataset. It also
		provides powerful pivoting and other group manipulation
		functions.
