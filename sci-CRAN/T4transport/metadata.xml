		Tools for Computational Optimal Transport // Transport theory has
		seen much success in many fields of statistics and machine
		learning. We provide a variety of algorithms to compute
		Wasserstein distance, barycenter, and others. See Peyr and
		Cuturi (2019) doi:10.1561/2200000073 for the general exposition
		to the study of computational optimal transport.
