		Linking and Equating Methods in Unidimensional Item Response
		Theory // IRT-based methods are used to estimate IRT linking
		coefficients and to perform IRT equating under the common item
		non-equivalent group design. For the IRT linking procedure, the
		Mean/Mean, Mean/Sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord methods are
		available. For IRT test score equating, the true score equating
		and observed score equating methods are available. This package
		supports both dichotomous IRT models (1PL, 2PL and 3PL) and
		polytomous IRT models (graded response model, partial credit
		model, and generalized partial credit model). In addition to
		IRT linking and equating capabilities, there are several useful
		functions such as importing item and/or ability parameters from
		IRT software, generating simulated data, estimating the
		standard error of equating due to the random selection of
		common items, computing the conditional distribution of
		observed scores using the Lord-Wingersky recursion formula,
		computing item and test information functions, computing item
		and test characteristic curve functions, and plotting item and
		test characteristic curves and item and test information
		functions as well as scatter plots.
