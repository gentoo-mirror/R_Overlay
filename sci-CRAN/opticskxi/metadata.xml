		OPTICS K-Xi Density-Based Clustering // Density-based clustering
		methods are well adapted to the clustering of high-dimensional
		data and enable the discovery of core groups of various shapes
		despite large amounts of noise. This package provides a novel
		density-based cluster extraction method, OPTICS k-Xi, and a
		framework to compare k-Xi models using distance-based metrics
		to investigate datasets with unknown number of clusters. The
		vignette first introduces density-based algorithms with
		simulated datasets, then presents and evaluates the k-Xi
		cluster extraction method. Finally, the models comparison
		framework is described and experimented on 2 genetic datasets
		to identify groups and their discriminating features. The k-Xi
		algorithm is a novel OPTICS cluster extraction method that
		specifies directly the number of clusters and does not require
		fine-tuning of the steepness parameter as the OPTICS Xi method.
		Combined with a framework that compares models with varying
		parameters, the OPTICS k-Xi method can identify groups in noisy
		datasets with unknown number of clusters. Results on summarized
		genetic data of 1,200 patients are in Charlon T. (2019)
		doi:10.13097/archive-ouverte/unige:161795. A short video
		tutorial can be found at
