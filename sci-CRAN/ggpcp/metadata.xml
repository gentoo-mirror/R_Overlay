		Parallel Coordinate Plots in the 'ggplot2' Framework // Modern
		Parallel Coordinate Plots have been introduced in the 1980s as
		a way to visualize arbitrarily many numeric variables. This
		Grammar of Graphics implementation also incorporates
		categorical variables into the plots in a principled manner. By
		separating the data managing part from the visual rendering, we
		give full access to the users while keeping the number of
		parameters manageably low.
