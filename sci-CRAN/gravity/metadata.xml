		Estimation Methods for Gravity Models // Gravity models are used
		to explain bilateral flows related to the sizes of bilateral
		partners, a measure of distance between them and other
		influences on interaction costs. The underlying idea is rather
		simple.     The greater the masses of two bodies and the
		smaller the distance between them, the stronger their
		attraction. This concept is applied to several research topics
		such as trade, migration or foreign direct investment. Even
		though their basic idea is rather simple, gravity models can
		become complex regarding the choice of models or estimation
		methods. As especially for gravity beginners it is difficult to
		get an overview of the different methods and implement them in
		R, the package provides a wrapper of different standard
		estimation methods for gravity models. By considering the
		descriptions and codes of the estimation methods, users get a
		comprehensive and application-oriented overview of the
		different methods, see which method may be suitable for a
		certain research question or type of data and extend the code
		available to their research projects. The package contains two
		types of estimation methods: those estimating gravity models in
		their log-log form, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed
		Effects, Double Demeaning (DDM), Bonus vetus OLS with simple
		averages (BVU) and with GDP-weights (BVW), Structural Iterated
		Least Squares (SILS), Tetrads, and different Tobit models
		(Tobit, ET-Tobit, EK-Tobit). These methods are partly complex
		to understand and program and thus a comparison of them is not
		straightforward, wherefore the package aims at easing an
		overview of the different methods combined with a direct
		application. A second type of estimation methods utilizes the
		gravity model in its multiplicative form with a log-link and
		different families of distributions. They are relatively easy
		to compute, added for completeness and contain the methods
		Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML), Gamma Pseudo Maximum
		Likelihood (GPML), Negative Binomial Pseudo Maximum Likelihood
		(NBPML), and Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS). All functions named
		estimate gravity models, but they differ in whether they
		estimate them in their multiplicative or additive form, their
		requirements and assumptions with respect to data, their
		handling of Multilateral Resistance terms as well as their
		possibilities concerning the inclusion of unilateral
		independent variables. Therefore, they normally lead to
		different estimation results. We refer the user to the Gravity
		Cookbook website (https://sites.google.com/site/hiegravity/)
		for more information on gravity models in general. Head, K. and
		Mayer, T. (2014) DOI:10.1016/B978-0-444-54314-1.00003-3 provide
		a comprehensive and accessible overview of the theoretical and
		empirical development of the gravity literature as well as the
		use of gravity models and the various estimation methods,
		especially their merits and potential problems regarding
		applicability as well as different datasets. In order to have a
		straightforward application of all methods, the package comes
		with two example dataset, one including and the other one
		excluding zero trade flows. Examples utilizing these dataset
		are included in the description of the methods. As the range of
		gravity models and their suitable estimation methods is huge
		and specific to data and research question at hand, the
		functions are kept simple such that researchers can utilize
		them as a starting point of their research and get familiar
		with them. On the Gravity Cookbook website
		(https://sites.google.com/site/hiegravity/) Keith Head and
		Thierry Mayer provide Stata code for most methods. Where
		possible, the functions are tested to lead the same results as
		the Stata code when choosing the option of robust variance
		estimation. However, compared to the Stata code available, the
		functions presented in this package provide users with more
		flexibility regarding the type of estimation, the number and
		type of independent variables as well as the possible data.
		Furthermore, additional functions are added. The functions of
		the package include distance as an independent variable. If a
		panel model is used time-invariant effects, such as
		geographical distance, may have to be excluded; see the
		respective descriptions. Therefore, it is up to the user to
		ensure that the functions can be applied to panel data.
		Depending on the panel dataset and the variables - specifically
		the type of fixed effects - included in the model, it may
		easily occur that the model is not computable. Depending on the
		specific model, the code of the respective function may has to
		be changed in order to exclude the distance variable from the
		estimation. For a comprehensive overview of gravity models for
		panel data see Egger, P.,  Pfaffermayr, M. (2003)
		DOI:10.1007/s001810200146, Gomez-Herrera, E. (2013)
		DOI:10.1007/s00181-012-0576-2 and Head, K., Mayer, T.,  Ries,
		J. (2010) DOI:10.1016/j.jinteco.2010.01.002 as well as the
		references therein (see also the references included in the
		descriptions of the different functions). At the very least,
		the user should take special care with respect to the meaning
		of the estimated coefficients and variances as well as the
		decision about which effects to include in the estimation. As,
		to our knowledge at the moment, there is no explicit literature
		covering the estimation of a gravity equation by Double
		Demeaning, Structural Iterated Least Squares or Bonus vetus OLS
		using panel data, we do not recommend to apply these methods in
		this case. Contributions, extensions and error corrections are
		very welcome. Please do not hesitate to contact us. We thank
		Martin Bresslein for valuable comments and advice on early
		versions of the package.
