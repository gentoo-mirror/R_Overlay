		Inferring the Topology of Omics Data // Infers a topology of
		relationships between different datasets, such as multi-omics
		and phenotypic data recorded on the same samples. We based this
		methodology on the RV coefficient (Robert  Escoufier, 1976,
		doi:10.2307/2347233), a measure of matrix correlation, which we
		have extended for partial matrix correlations and binary data
		(Aben et al., 2018, doi:10.1101/293993).
