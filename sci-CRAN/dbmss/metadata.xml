		Distance-Based Measures of Spatial Structures // Simple
		computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to
		characterize the spatial structures of mapped objects,
		following Marcon, Traissac, Puech, and Lang (2015)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v067.c03. Includes classical functions
		(Ripley's K and others) and more recent ones used by spatial
		economists (Duranton and Overman's Kd, Marcon and Puech's M).
