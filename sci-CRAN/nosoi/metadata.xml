		A Forward Agent-Based Transmission Chain Simulator // The aim of
		'nosoi' (pronounced no.si) is to provide a flexible agent-based
		stochastic transmission chain/epidemic simulator (Lequime et
		al. in prep). It is named after the daimones of plague,
		sickness and disease that escaped Pandora's jar in the Greek
		mythology. 'nosoi' is able to take into account the influence
		of multiple variable on the transmission process (e.g. dual-
		host systems (such as arboviruses), within-host viral dynamics,
		transportation, population structure), alone or taken together,
		to create complex but relatively intuitive epidemiological
		simulations.
