		Asymmetric Distributions and Quantile Estimation // Provides the
		local polynomial maximum likelihood estimates for the location
		and scale functions as well as the semiparametric quantile
		estimates in the generalized quantile-based asymmetric
		distributional setting. These functions are useful for any
		member of the generalized quantile-based asymmetric family of
		distributions.
