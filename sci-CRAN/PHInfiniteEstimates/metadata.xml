		Tools for Inference in the Presence of a Monotone Likelihood //
		Proportional hazards estimation in the presence of a partially
		monotone likelihood has difficulties, in that finite estimators
		do not exist.  These difficulties are related to those arising
		from logistic and multinomial regression.  References for
		methods are given in the separate function documents.
		Supported by grant NSF DMS 1712839.
