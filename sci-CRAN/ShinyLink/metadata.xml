		'Shiny' Based Record Linkage Tool // A bridge is created between
		existing robust open-source record linkage algorithms and an
		urgently needed user-friendly platform that removes financial
		and technical barriers, setting a new standard for data
		interoperability in public health and bioinformatics. The
		'fastLink' algorithms are used for matching. Ted Enamorado et
		al. (2019) doi:10.1017/S0003055418000783.
