		Fit Repeated Linear Regressions // When fitting a set of linear
		regressions which have some same variables, we can separate the
		matrix and reduce the computation cost. This package aims to
		fit a set of repeated linear regressions faster. More details
		can be found in this blog Lijun Wang (2017)
