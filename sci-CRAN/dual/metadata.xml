		Automatic Differentiation with Dual Numbers // Automatic
		differentiation is achieved by using dual numbers without
		providing hand-coded gradient functions. The output value of a
		mathematical function is returned with the values of its exact
		first derivative (or gradient). For more details see Baydin,
		Pearlmutter, Radul, and Siskind (2018)
