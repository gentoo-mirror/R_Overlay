		Fast and Robust Multi-Scale Graph Clustering // A graph community
		detection algorithm that aims to be performant on large graphs
		and robust, returning consistent results across runs. SpeakEasy
		2 (SE2), the underlying algorithm, is described in Chris
		Gaiteri, David R. Connell  Faraz A. Sultan et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1186/s13059-023-03062-0. The core algorithm is written
		in 'C', providing speed and keeping the memory requirements
		low. This implementation can take advantage of multiple
		computing cores without increasing memory usage. SE2 can detect
		community structure across scales, making it a good choice for
		biological data, which often has hierarchical structure. Graphs
		can be passed to the algorithm as adjacency matrices using base
		'R' matrices, the 'Matrix' library, 'igraph' graphs, or any
		data that can be coerced into a matrix.
