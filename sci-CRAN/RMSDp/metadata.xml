		Refined Modified Stahel-Donoho (MSD) Estimators for Outlier
		Detection (Parallel Version) // A parallel function for
		multivariate outlier detection named modified Stahel-Donoho
		estimators is contained in this package.  The function RMSDp()
		is for elliptically distributed datasets and recognizes
		outliers based on Mahalanobis distance. This function is for
		higher dimensional datasets that cannot be handled by a single
		core function RMSD() included in 'RMSD' package.  See Wada and
		Tsubaki (2013) doi:10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.86 for the detail
		of the algorithm.
