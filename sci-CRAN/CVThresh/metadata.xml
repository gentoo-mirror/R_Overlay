		Level-Dependent Cross-Validation Thresholding // The level-
		dependent cross-validation method is implemented for the
		selection of thresholding value in wavelet shrinkage. This
		procedure is implemented by coupling a conventional cross
		validation with an imputation method due to a limitation of
		data length, a power of 2. It can be easily applied to
		classical leave-one-out and k-fold cross validation. Since the
		procedure is computationally fast, a level-dependent cross
		validation can be performed for wavelet shrinkage of various
		data such as a data with correlated errors.
