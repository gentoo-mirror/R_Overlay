		FWER-Based Multiple Testing Procedures with Adaptation for
		Discrete Tests // Implementations of several multiple testing
		procedures that control the family-wise error rate (FWER)
		designed specifically for discrete tests. Included are discrete
		adaptations of the Bonferroni, Holm, Hochberg and idk
		procedures as described in the papers Dhler (2010) "Validation
		of credit default probabilities using multiple-testing
		procedures" doi:10.21314/JRMV.2010.062 and Zhu  Guo (2019)
		"Family-Wise Error Rate Controlling Procedures for Discrete
		Data" doi:10.1080/19466315.2019.1654912. The main procedures of
		this package take as input the results of a test procedure from
		package 'DiscreteTests' or a set of observed p-values and their
		discrete support under their nulls. A shortcut function to
		apply discrete procedures directly to data is also provided.
