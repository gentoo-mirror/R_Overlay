		Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation using Magnetic Resonance
		Imaging (MRI) // Trains and makes predictions from the OASIS
		method, described in detail in the paper "OASIS is Automated
		Statistical Inference for Segmentation, with applications to
		multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation in MRI"
		doi:10.1016/j.nicl.2013.03.002. OASIS is a method for multiple
		sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation on structural magnetic
		resonance image (MRI) studies. OASIS creates probability maps
		of lesion presence using the FLAIR, T2, T1, and PD structural
		MRI volumes. This packages allows for training of the OASIS
		model and prediction of OASIS probability maps from a trained
		model with user supplied studies that have a gold standard
		lesion segmentation masks. The package will also create OASIS
		probability maps for MRI studies using the OASIS model from the
		OASIS paper if no gold standard lesion segmentation masks are
		available.
