		Assembly of Pharmacometric Models // Construct pharmacometric
		nonlinear mixed effect models by combining predefined model
		components and automatically generate model code for NONMEM.
		Models are created by combining parameter and observation
		models, algebraic relationships, compartments, and flows.
		Pharmacokinetic models can be assembled from the higher-order
		components: absorption, distribution, and elimination. The
		generated code is optimized for performance by recognizing, for
		example, linear differential equations or differential
		equations with an analytic solution.
