		Clustering Algorithm for Data Integration and Disease Subtyping
		// Provides a robust approach for omics data integration and
		disease subtyping. 'PINSPlus' supports both single and multiple
		data types. The software automatically determines the optimal
		number of clusters and then partitions the samples in a way
		such that the results are robust to noise and data
		perturbation. 'PINSPlus' is fast and it supports parallel
		computing on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
