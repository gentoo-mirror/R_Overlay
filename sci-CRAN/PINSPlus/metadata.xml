		Clustering Algorithm for Data Integration and Disease Subtyping
		// Provides a robust approach for omics data integration and
		disease subtyping. PINSPlus is fast and supports the analysis
		of large datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples and
		features. The software automatically determines the optimal
		number of clusters and then partitions the samples in a way
		such that the results are robust against noise and data
		perturbation (Nguyen et al. (2019) DOI:
		10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1049, Nguyen et al. (2017)DOI:
		10.1101/gr.215129.116, Nguyen et al. (2021)DOI:
