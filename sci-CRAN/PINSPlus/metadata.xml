		Perturbation Clustering for Data Integration and Disease
		Subtyping // Clustering algorithm for determining the number of
		clusters and location of each sample in the clusters.
		Perturbation clustering for data INtegration and disease
		Subtyping (PINS - Nguyen T, Tagett R, Diaz D, Draghici S (2017)
		doi:10.1101/gr.215129.116) is a novel approach for integration
		of data and classification of diseases into various subtypes.
		PINS supports both single and multiple data types. 'PINSPlus'
		is designed to be user-friendly and primarily makes use of two
		main functions. 'PINSPlus' fasten PINS algorithm by supporting
		parallel processing and using efficient stopping criteria.
