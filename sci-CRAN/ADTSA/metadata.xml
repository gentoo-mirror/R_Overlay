		Time Series Analysis // Analyzes autocorrelation and partial
		autocorrelation using surrogate methods and bootstrapping, and
		computes the acceleration constants for the vectorized moving
		block bootstrap provided by this package. It generates
		percentile, bias-corrected, and accelerated intervals and
		estimates partial autocorrelations using Durbin-Levinson. This
		package calculates the autocorrelation power spectrum, computes
		cross-correlations between two time series, computes bandwidth
		for any time series, and performs autocorrelation frequency
		analysis.
