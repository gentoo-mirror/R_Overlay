		Leaf Area Determination from Visual Image // Measurements of leaf
		area are important in the studies of plant biological
		characteristics. High-throughput plant phenotyping using image
		analysis is the key area in the domain of plant phenotyping.
		For determining the leaf area, the RGB image is converted into
		the grayscale image by simply averaging the Red(R), Green (G)
		and Blue (B) pixel values. Grayscale image is then converted
		into a binary image using Otsus thresholding method Otsu, N.
		(1979) doi:10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076 to separate plant area
		from the background (image segmentation). The segmentation
		process was accomplished by selecting the pixels with values
		over the threshold value belonging to the plant region and
		other pixels to the background region. The resulting binary
		image consists of white and black pixels representing the plant
		and background regions, respectively. Finally, the number of
		pixels inside the plant region was counted and converted to
		square centimetres (cm2) using the reference object (any object
		whose actual area is known previously) to get the projected
		leaf area.
