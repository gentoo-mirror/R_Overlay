		Recursive Construction of Nested Resolvable Designs and
		Associated Uniform Designs // Implements recursive construction
		methods for balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs), their
		second generation, resolvable BIBDs (RBIBDs), and uniform
		designs (UDs) derived from projective geometries over GF(2). It
		enables extraction of nested structures in multiple stages and
		supports recursive resolution processes, as introduced in
		Boudraa et al. (2013).
