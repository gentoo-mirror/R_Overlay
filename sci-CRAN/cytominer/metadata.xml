		Methods for Image-Based Cell Profiling // Typical morphological
		profiling datasets have millions of cells and hundreds of
		features per cell. When working with this data, you must clean
		the data, normalize the features to make them comparable across
		experiments, transform the features, select features based on
		their quality, and aggregate the single-cell data, if needed.
		'cytominer' makes these steps fast and easy. Methods used in
		practice in the field are discussed in Caicedo (2017)
		doi:10.1038/nmeth.4397. An overview of the field is presented
		in Caicedo (2016) doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2016.04.003.
