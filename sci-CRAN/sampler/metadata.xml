		Sample Design, Drawing  Data Analysis Using Data Frames //
		Determine sample sizes, draw samples, and conduct data analysis
		using data frames. It specifically enables you to determine
		simple random sample sizes, stratified sample sizes, and
		complex stratified sample sizes using a secondary variable such
		as population; draw simple random samples and stratified random
		samples from sampling data frames; determine which observations
		are missing from a random sample, missing by strata, duplicated
		within a dataset; and perform data analysis, including
		proportions, margins of error and upper and lower bounds for
		simple, stratified and cluster sample designs.
