		Trim an Object // A lightweight toolkit to reduce the size of a
		list object. The object is minimized by recursively removing
		elements from the object one-by-one. The process is constrained
		by a reference function call specified by the user, where the
		target object is given as an argument. The procedure will not
		allow elements to be removed from the object, that will cause
		results from the function call to diverge from the function
		call with the original object.
