		Management of Deterministic and Stochastic Projects // Management
		problems of deterministic and stochastic projects. It obtains
		the duration of a project and the appropriate slack for each
		activity in a deterministic context. In addition it obtains a
		schedule of activities' time (Castro, Gmez  Tejada (2007)
		doi:10.1016/j.orl.2007.01.003). When the project is done, and
		the actual duration for each activity is known, then it can
		know how long the project is delayed and make a fair delivery
		of the delay between each activity (Bergantios, Valencia-Toledo
		Vidal-Puga (2018) doi:10.1016/j.dam.2017.08.012). In a
		stochastic context it can estimate the average duration of the
		project and plot a histogram of this duration. As in the
		deterministic case, it can make a distribution of the delay
		generated by observing the project already carried out.
