		Data Driven I-v Feature Extraction // The Data Driven I-V Feature
		Extraction is used to extract Current-Voltage (I-V) features
		from I-V curves. I-V curves indicate the relationship between
		current and voltage for a solar cell or Photovoltaic (PV)
		modules. The I-V features such as maximum power point (Pmp),
		shunt resistance (Rsh), series resistance (Rs),short circuit
		current (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF),
		current at maximum power (Imp) and voltage at maximum
		power(Vmp) contain important information of the performance for
		PV modules. The traditional method uses the single diode model
		to model I-V curves and extract I-V features. This package does
		not use the diode model, but uses data-driven a method which
		select different linear parts of the I-V curves to extract I-V
		features. This method also uses a sampling method to calculate
		uncertainties when extracting I-V features. Also, because of
		the partially shaded array, "steps" occurs in I-V curves. The
		"Segmented Regression" method is used to identify steps in I-V
		curves. This material is based upon work supported by the U.S.
		Department of Energys Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable
		Energy (EERE) under Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO)
		Agreement Number DE-EE0007140. Further information can be found
