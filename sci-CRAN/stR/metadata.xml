		Seasonal Trend Decomposition Using Regression // Methods for
		decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend time series
		decomposition procedure based on Regression) and Robust STR. In
		some ways, STR is similar to Ridge Regression and Robust STR
		can be related to LASSO. They allow for multiple seasonal
		components, multiple linear covariates with constant, flexible
		and seasonal influence. Seasonal patterns (for both seasonal
		components and seasonal covariates) can be fractional and
		flexible over time; moreover they can be either strictly
		periodic or have a more complex topology. The methods provide
		confidence intervals for the estimated components. The methods
		can also be used for forecasting.
