		Tools for Prevalence Assessment Studies // The prevalence package
		provides Frequentist and Bayesian methods for prevalence
		assessment studies. IMPORTANT: the truePrev functions in the
		prevalence package call on JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler),
		which therefore has to be available on the user's system. JAGS
		can be downloaded from https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/.
