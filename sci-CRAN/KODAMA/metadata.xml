		Knowledge Discovery by Accuracy Maximization // KODAMA algorithm
		is an unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithm that
		performs feature extraction from noisy and high-dimensional
		data. It facilitates identification of patterns representing
		underlying groups on all samples in a data set. The algorithm
		was published by Cacciatore et al. 2014
		DOI:10.1073/pnas.1220873111. Addition functions was introduced
		by Cacciatore et al. 2017 DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw705 to
		facilitate the identification of key features associated with
		the generated output and are easily interpretable for the user.
		Cross-validated techniques are also included in this package.
