		Knowledge Discovery by Accuracy Maximization // A self-guided,
		weakly supervised learning algorithm for feature extraction
		from noisy and high-dimensional data. It facilitates the
		identification of patterns that reflect underlying group
		structures across all samples in a dataset. The method
		incorporates a novel strategy to integrate spatial information,
		improving the interpretability of results in spatially resolved
		data.
