		Interactive Q-Q and Manhattan Plots Using 'plotly.js' // Create
		interactive manhattan, Q-Q and volcano plots that are usable
		from the R console, in 'Dash' apps, in the 'RStudio' viewer
		pane, in 'R Markdown' documents, and in 'Shiny' apps. Hover the
		mouse pointer over a point to show details or drag a rectangle
		to zoom. A manhattan plot is a popular graphical method for
		visualizing results from high-dimensional data analysis such as
		a (epi)genome wide association study (GWAS or EWAS), in which
		p-values, Z-scores, test statistics are plotted on a scatter
		plot against their genomic position. Manhattan plots are used
		for visualizing potential regions of interest in the genome
		that are associated with a phenotype. Interactive manhattan
		plots allow the inspection of specific value (e.g. rs number or
		gene name) by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as
		zooming into a region of the genome (e.g. a chromosome) by
		dragging a rectangle around the relevant area. This work is
		based on the 'qqman' package and the 'plotly.js' engine. It
		produces similar manhattan and Q-Q plots as the 'manhattan' and
		'qq' functions in the 'qqman' package, with the advantage of
		including extra annotation information and interactive web-
		based visualizations directly from R. Once uploaded to a
		'plotly' account, 'plotly' graphs (and the data behind them)
		can be viewed and modified in a web browser.
