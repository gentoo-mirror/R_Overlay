		Interact with Metadata Records and Media on the Europeana
		Repository // Interact with the Europeana Data Model via a
		variety of API endpoints that contains digital collections from
		thousands of institutions around Europe. This translates to
		millions of Cultural Heritage Objects in the form of image,
		text, video, sound and 3D, accompanied by rich metadata. The
		Data Model design principles are based on the core principles
		and best practices of the Semantic Web and Linked Data efforts
		to which Europeana contributes (see, e.g., Doerr, Martin, et
		al. The europeana data model (edm). World Library and
		Information Congress: 76th IFLA general conference and
		assembly. Vol. 10. 2010.). The package also provides methods
		for bulk downloads of specific subsets of items, including both
		their metadata and their associated media files.
