		Wicked Fast, Accurate Quantiles Using t-Digests // The t-Digest
		construction algorithm, by Dunning et al., (2019)
		arXiv:1902.04023v1, uses a variant of 1-dimensional k-means
		clustering to produce a very compact data structure that allows
		accurate estimation of quantiles. This t-Digest data structure
		can be used to estimate quantiles, compute other rank
		statistics or even to estimate related measures like trimmed
		means. The advantage of the t-Digest over previous digests for
		this purpose is that the t-Digest handles data with full
		floating point resolution. The accuracy of quantile estimates
		produced by t-Digests can be orders of magnitude more accurate
		than those produced by previous digest algorithms. Methods are
		provided to create and update t-Digests and retrieve quantiles
		from the accumulated distributions.
