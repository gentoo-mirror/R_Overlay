		Versatile Functions for Working with Pedigrees // Tools to sort,
		edit and prune pedigrees and to extract the inbreeding
		coefficients and the relationship matrix (includes code for
		pedigrees from self-pollinated species). The use of pedigree
		data is central to genetics research within the animal and
		plant breeding communities to predict breeding values. The
		relationship matrix between the individuals can be derived from
		pedigree structure following the algorithms described for
		example in Vazquez et al., 2010 doi:10.2527/jas.2009-1952.
