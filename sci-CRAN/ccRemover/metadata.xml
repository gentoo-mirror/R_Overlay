		Removes the Cell-Cycle Effect from Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing
		Data // Implements a method for identifying and removing the
		cell-cycle effect from scRNA-Seq data. The description of the
		method is in Barron M. and Li J. (2016) doi:10.1038/srep33892.
		Identifying and removing the cell-cycle effect from single-cell
		RNA-Sequencing data. Submitted. Different from previous
		methods, ccRemover implements a mechanism that formally tests
		whether a component is cell-cycle related or not, and thus
		while it often thoroughly removes the cell-cycle effect, it
		preserves other features/signals of interest in the data.
