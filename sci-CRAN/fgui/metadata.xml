		Function GUI // Rapidly create a GUI interface for a function you
		created by automatically creating widgets for arguments of the
		function. Automatically parses help routines for context-
		sensative help to these arguments. The interface essentially a
		wrapper to some tcltk routines to both simplify and facilitate
		GUI creation. More advanced tcltk routines/GUI objects can be
		incorporated into the interface for greater customization for
		the more experienced.
