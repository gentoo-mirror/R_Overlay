		Robust Loss Development Using MCMC // Bayesian analysis of loss
		development on insurance triangles or 'BALD' is a Bayesian
		model of developing aggregate loss triangles in property
		casualty insurance. This actuarial model makes use of a
		heteroskedastic and skewed t-likelihood with endogenous degrees
		of freedom, employs model averaging by means of Reversible Jump
		MCMC, and accommodates a structural break in the path of the
		consumption of benefits. Further, the model is capable of
		incorporating expert information in the calendar year effect.
		In an accompanying vignette, this model is applied to two
		widely studied General Liability and Auto Bodily Injury
		Liability loss triangles. For a description of the methodology,
		see Frank A. Schmid (2010) doi:10.2139/ssrn.1501706.
