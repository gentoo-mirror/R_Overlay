		Spatiotemporal Boundary Detection Model for Areal Unit Data //
		Implements a spatiotemporal boundary detection model with a
		dissimilarity metric for areal data with inference in a
		Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The
		response variable can be modeled as Gaussian (no nugget),
		probit or Tobit link and spatial correlation is introduced at
		each time point through a conditional autoregressive (CAR)
		prior. Temporal correlation is introduced through a
		hierarchical structure and can be specified as exponential or
		first-order autoregressive. Full details of the package can be
		found in the accompanying vignette. Furthermore, the details of
		the package can be found in the corresponding paper on arXiv by
		Berchuck et al (2018): "Diagnosing Glaucoma Progression with
		Visual Field Data Using a Spatiotemporal Boundary Detection
		Method", arXiv:1805.11636.
