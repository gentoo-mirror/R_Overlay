		Bayesian Generalized Additive Model Selection // Generalized
		additive model selection via approximate Bayesian inference is
		provided. Bayesian mixed model-based penalized splines with
		spike-and-slab-type coefficient prior distributions are used to
		facilitate fitting and selection. The approximate Bayesian
		inference engine options are: (1) Markov chain Monte Carlo and
		(2) mean field variational Bayes. Markov chain Monte Carlo has
		better Bayesian inferential accuracy, but requires a longer
		run-time. Mean field variational Bayes is faster, but less
		accurate. The methodology is described in He and Wand (2023)
		arXiv:2201.00412.
