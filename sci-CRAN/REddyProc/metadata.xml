		Post Processing of (Half-)Hourly Eddy-Covariance Measurements //
		Standard and extensible Eddy-Covariance data post-processing
		(Wutzler et al. (2018) doi:10.5194/bg-15-5015-2018) includes
		uStar-filtering, gap-filling, and flux-partitioning. The Eddy-
		Covariance (EC)  micrometeorological technique quantifies
		continuous exchange fluxes of gases, energy, and momentum
		between an ecosystem and the atmosphere. It is important for
		understanding ecosystem dynamics and upscaling exchange fluxes.
		(Aubinet et al. (2012) doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2351-1). This
		package inputs pre-processed (half-)hourly data and supports
		further processing. First, a quality-check and filtering is
		performed based on the relationship between measured flux and
		friction velocity (uStar) to discard biased data (Papale et al.
		(2006) doi:10.5194/bg-3-571-2006). Second, gaps in the data are
		filled based on information from environmental conditions
		(Reichstein et al. (2005)
		doi:10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001002.x). Third, the net flux of
		carbon dioxide is partitioned into its gross fluxes in and out
		of the ecosystem by night-time based and day-time based
		approaches (Lasslop et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02041.x).
