		Multi-Locus Random-SNP-Effect Mixed Linear Model Tools for
		Genome-Wide Association Study // Conduct multi-locus genome-
		wide association study under the framework of multi-locus
		random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). First, each
		marker on the genome is scanned. Bonferroni correction is
		replaced by a less stringent selection criterion for
		significant test. Then, all the markers that are potentially
		associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus genetic
		model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes and all
		the nonzero effects were further identified by likelihood ratio
		test for true QTL. Wen YJ, Zhang H, Ni YL, Huang B, Zhang J,
