		Multi-Reader Multi-Case Analysis of Binary Diagnostic Tests //
		The goal of 'MRMCbinary' is to compare the performance of
		diagnostic tests (i.e., sensitivity and specificity) for binary
		outcomes in multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) studies. It is based
		on conditional logistic regression and Cochrans Q test (or
		McNemars test when the number of modalities is equal to 2).
