		Convert Statistical Objects into Tidy Tibbles // Summarizes key
		information about statistical objects in tidy tibbles. This
		makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently
		work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three
		verbs that each provide different types of information about a
		model. tidy() summarizes information about model components
		such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports
		information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit
		measures like AIC and BIC. augment() adds information about
		individual observations to a dataset, such as fitted values or
		influence measures.
