		Brace Expansions // Performs brace expansions on strings.  Made
		popular by Unix shells, brace expansion allows users to quickly
		generate certain character vectors by taking a single string
		and (recursively) expanding the comma-separated lists and
		double-period-separated integer and character sequences
		enclosed within braces in that string.  The double-period-
		separated numeric integer expansion also supports padding the
		resulting numbers with zeros.
