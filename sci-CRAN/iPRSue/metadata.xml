		Individual Polygenic Risk Score Uncertainty Estimation //
		Provides tools for estimating uncertainty in individual
		polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using both sampling-based and
		analytical methods, as well as the Best Linear Unbiased
		Estimator (BLUE). These methods quantify variability in PRS
		estimates for both binary and quantitative traits. See
		Henderson (1975) doi:10.2307/2529430 for more details.
