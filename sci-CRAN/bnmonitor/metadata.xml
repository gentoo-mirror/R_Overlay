		An Implementation of Sensitivity Analysis in Bayesian Networks //
		An implementation of sensitivity and robustness methods in
		Bayesian networks in R. It includes methods to perform
		parameter variations via a variety of co-variation schemes, to
		compute sensitivity functions and to quantify the dissimilarity
		of two Bayesian networks via distances and divergences. It
		further includes diagnostic methods to assess the goodness of
		fit of a Bayesian networks to data, including global, node and
		parent-child monitors. Reference: M. Leonelli, R. Ramanathan,
