		Hot Spots // The hotspots package is designed to look within a
		set of measured values of a variable and identify values that
		are disproportionately high based on both the deviance of any
		given value from a statistical distribution and its similarity
		to other values. Because this relative magnitude of each value
		is taken into account, a value that is a statistical outlier
		may not always be a hot spot if other values are similarly
		large.
