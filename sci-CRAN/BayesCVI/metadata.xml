		Bayesian Cluster Validity Index // Algorithms for computing and
		generating plots with and without error bars for Bayesian
		cluster validity index (BCVI) (O. Preedasawakul, and N.
		Wiroonsri, A Bayesian Cluster Validity Index, Computational
		Statistics  Data Analysis, 202, 108053, 2025.
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2024.108053) based on several underlying
		cluster validity indexes (CVIs) including Calinski-Harabasz,
		Chou-Su-Lai, Davies-Bouldin, Dunn,  Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-
		Maulik, Point biserial correlation, the score function,
		Starczewski, and Wiroonsri indices for hard clustering, and
		Correlation Cluster Validity, the generalized C, HF, KWON,
		KWON2, Modified Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik, Pakhira-
		Bandyopadhyay-Maulik, Tang, Wiroonsri-Preedasawakul, Wu-Li, and
		Xie-Beni indices for soft clustering. The package is compatible
		with K-means, fuzzy C means, EM clustering, and hierarchical
		clustering (single, average, and complete linkage). Though BCVI
		is compatible with any underlying existing CVIs, we recommend
		users to use either WI or WP as the underlying CVI.
