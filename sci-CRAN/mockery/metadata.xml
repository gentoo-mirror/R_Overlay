		Mocking Library for R // The two main functionalities of this
		package are creating mock objects (functions) and selectively
		intercepting calls to a given function that originate in some
		other function. It can be used with any testing framework
		available for R. Mock objects can be injected with either this
		package's own stub() function or a similar
		with_mocked_binding() facility present in the 'testthat'
		package.
