		Measure of Agreement Between Two Raters // Measure of agreement
		delta was originally by Martn  Femia (2004)
		DOI:10.1348/000711004849268. Since then has been considered as
		agreement measure for different fields, since their behavior is
		usually better than the usual kappa index by Cohen (1960)
		DOI:10.1177/001316446002000104. The main issue with delta is
		that can not be computed by hand contrary to kappa. The current
		algorithm is based on the Version 5 of the delta windows
		program that can be found on https://www.ugr.es/~bioest/softwar
		e/delta/cmd.php?seccion=downloads.
