		Measure of Agreement Between Two Raters // Measure of agreement
		Delta was originally by Martn  Femia (2004)
		DOI:10.1348/000711004849268. Since then has been considered as
		agreement measure for different fields, since their behavior is
		usually better than the usual Kappa index by Cohen (1960)
		DOI:10.1177/001316446002000104. The main issue with Delta is
		that can not be computed by hand contrary to Kappa.
