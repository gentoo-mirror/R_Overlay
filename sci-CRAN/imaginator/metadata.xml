		Simulate General Insurance Policies and Losses // Simulate
		general insurance policies, losses and loss emergence. The
		functions contemplate deterministic and stochastic policy
		retention and growth scenarios. Retention and growth rates are
		percentages relative to the expiring portfolio. Claims are
		simulated for each policy. This is accomplished either be
		assuming a frequency distribution per development lag or by
		generating random wait times until claim emergence and
		settlement. Loss simulation uses standard loss distributions
		for claim amounts.
