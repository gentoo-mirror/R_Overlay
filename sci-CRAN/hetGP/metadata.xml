		Heteroskedastic Gaussian Process Modeling and Design under
		Replication // Performs Gaussian process regression with
		heteroskedastic noise following the model by Binois, M.,
		Gramacy, R., Ludkovski, M. (2016)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1611.05902, with implementation details in
		Binois, M.  Gramacy, R. B. (2021) doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i13.
		The input dependent noise is modeled as another Gaussian
		process. Replicated observations are encouraged as they yield
		computational savings. Sequential design procedures based on
		the integrated mean square prediction error and lookahead
		heuristics are provided, and notably fast update functions when
		adding new observations.
