		ACSS, Corresponding INSS, and GLP Algorithms // Allow user to run
		the Adaptive Correlated Spike and Slab (ACSS) algorithm,
		corresponding INdependent Spike and Slab (INSS) algorithm, and
		Giannone, Lenza and Primiceri (GLP) algorithm with adaptive
		burn-in. All of the three algorithms are used to fit high
		dimensional data set with either sparse structure, or dense
		structure with smaller contributions from all predictors. The
		state-of-the-art GLP algorithm is in Giannone, D., Lenza, M.,
		Primiceri, G. E. (2021, ISBN:978-92-899-4542-4) "Economic
		predictions with big data: The illusion of sparsity". The two
		new algorithms, ACSS algorithm and INSS algorithm, and the
		discussion on their performance can be seen in Yang, Z., Khare,
		K.,  Michailidis, G. (2024, submitted to Journal of Business
		Economic Statistics) "Bayesian methodology for adaptive
		sparsity and shrinkage in regression".
