		Graphical Displays for Structured Problem Solving and Diagnosis
		// Powerful graphical displays and statistical tools for
		structured problem solving and diagnosis. The functions of the
		'sherlock' package are especially useful for applying the
		process of elimination as a problem diagnosis technique. The
		'sherlock' package was designed to seamlessly work with the
		'tidyverse' set of packages and provides a collection of
		graphical displays built on top of the 'ggplot' and 'plotly'
		packages, such as different kinds of small multiple plots as
		well as helper functions such as adding reference lines,
		normalizing observations, reading in data or saving analysis
		results in an Excel file. References: David Hartshorne (2019,
