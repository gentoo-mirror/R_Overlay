		Bayesian Analysis of Randomized Experiments with Non-Compliance
		// Functions for Bayesian analysis of data from randomized
		experiments with non-compliance. The functions are based on the
		models described in Imbens and Rubin (1997)
		doi:10.1214/aos/1034276631. Currently only two types of outcome
		models are supported: binary outcomes and normally distributed
		outcomes. Models can be fit with and without the exclusion
		restriction and/or the strong access monotonicity assumption.
		Models are fit using the data augmentation algorithm as
		described in Tanner and Wong (1987) doi:10.2307/2289457.
