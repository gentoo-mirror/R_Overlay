		Data Management Tools for Real-Time Monitoring/Ecological
		Momentary Assessment Data // Do data management functions
		common in real-time monitoring (also called: ecological
		momentary assessment, experience sampling, micro-longitudinal)
		data, including creating power curves for multilevel data,
		centering on participant means and merging event-level data
		into momentary data sets where you need the events to
		correspond to the nearest data point in the momentary data.
		This is VERY early release software, and more features will be
		added over time.
