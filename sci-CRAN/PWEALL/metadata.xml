		Design and Monitoring of Survival Trials Accounting for Complex
		Situations // Calculates various functions needed for design
		and monitoring survival trials accounting for complex
		situations such as delayed treatment effect, treatment
		crossover, non-uniform accrual, and different censoring
		distributions between groups. The event time distribution is
		assumed to be piecewise exponential (PWE) distribution and the
		entry time is assumed to be piecewise uniform distribution. As
		compared with Version 1.2.1, two more types of hybrid crossover
		are added. A bug is corrected in the function "pwecx" that
		calculates the crossover-adjusted survival, distribution,
		density, hazard and cumulative hazard functions. Also, to
		generate the crossover-adjusted event time random variable,  a
		more efficient algorithm is used and the output includes
		crossover indicators.
