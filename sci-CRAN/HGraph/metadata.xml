		Use Graph Structure to Travel // It is used to travel graphs, by
		using DFS and BFS to get the path from node to each leaf node.
		Depth first traversal(DFS) is a recursive algorithm for
		searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.
		Traversal means visiting all the nodes of a graph. Breadth
		first traversal(BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or
		graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria.
		It starts at the trees root or graph and searches/visits all
		nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes
		at the next depth level. Also, it provides the matrix which is
		reachable between each node. Implement reference about Baruch
		Awerbuch (1985) doi:10.1016/0020-0190(85)90083-3.
