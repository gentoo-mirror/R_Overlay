		Fit a Penalized Constrained Continuation Ratio Model for
		Predicting an Ordinal Response // Penalized methods are useful
		for fitting over-parameterized models. This package includes
		functions for restructuring an ordinal response dataset for
		fitting continuation ratio models for datasets  where the
		number of covariates exceeds the sample size or when there is
		collinearity among the covariates. The glmnet fitting algorithm
		is used to fit the continuation ratio model after data
		restructuring.
