		Implementing GSCAD Method for Image Denoising and Inpainting //
		Method proposed in "Simultaneous Sparse Dictionary Learning and
		Pruning" ( Qu and Wang (2016) arXiv:1605.07870) is implemented.
		The idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using
		a few atoms of a learned and usually over-completed dictionary
		instead of a pre-defined basis. A proper size of the to-be-
		learned dictionary is determining at the same time during the
		procedure. Application includes image denoising and image
		inpainting.
