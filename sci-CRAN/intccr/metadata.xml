		Semiparametric Competing Risks Regression under Left Truncation
		and Interval Censoring with Missing Cause of Failure //
		Semiparametric regression models on the cumulative incidence
		function for interval-censored competing risks data as
		described in Bakoyannis, Yu,  Yiannoutsos (2017)
		doi:10.1002/sim.7350, left-truncated and interval-censored
		competing risks data, and interval-censored compering risks
		data and missing cause of failure. We provide the proportional
		subdistribution hazards model (Fine-Gray model), the
		proportional odds model, and other models that belong to the
		class of semiparametric generalized odds rate transformation
		models.
