		Semiparametric Competing Risks Regression under Interval
		Censoring // Semiparametric regression models on the cumulative
		incidence function for interval-censored competing risks data
		as described in Bakoyannis, Yu,  Yiannoutsos (2017)
		doi:10.1002/sim.7350. In addition, missing event types or left
		truncation are considered. We provide the proportional
		subdistribution hazards model (Fine-Gray model), the
		proportional odds model, and other models that belong to the
		class of semiparametric generalized odds rate transformation
		models.
