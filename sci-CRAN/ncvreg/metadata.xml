		Regularization Paths for SCAD and MCP Penalized Regression Models
		// Fits regularization paths for linear regression, GLM, and
		Cox regression models using lasso or nonconvex penalties, in
		particular the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly
		clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, with options for
		additional L2 penalties (the "elastic net" idea). Utilities for
		carrying out cross-validation as well as post-fitting
		visualization, summarization, inference, and prediction are
		also provided. For more information, see Breheny and Huang
		(2011) doi:10.1214/10-AOAS388 or visit the ncvreg homepage
