		Gaussian Process Laboratory // Gaussian process regression with
		an emphasis on kernels. Quantitative and qualitative inputs are
		accepted. Some pre-defined kernels are available, such as
		radial or tensor-sum for quantitative inputs, and compound
		symmetry, low rank, group kernel for qualitative inputs. The
		user can define new kernels and composite kernels through a
		formula mechanism. Useful methods include parameter estimation
		by maximum likelihood, simulation, prediction and leave-one-out
		validation.
