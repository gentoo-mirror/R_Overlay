		A Hybrid Spatial Model for Prediction and Capturing Spatial
		Variation in the Data // It is a hybrid spatial model that
		combines the variable selection capabilities of stepwise
		regression methods with the predictive power of the
		Geographically Weighted Regression(GWR) model.The developed
		hybrid model follows a two-step approach where the stepwise
		variable selection method is applied first to identify the
		subset of predictors that have the most significant impact on
		the response variable, and then a GWR model is fitted using
		those selected variables for spatial prediction at test or
		unknown locations. For method details,see Leung, Y., Mei, C. L.
		and Zhang, W. X. (2000).DOI:10.1068/a3162.This hybrid spatial
		model aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of GWR
		predictions by selecting a subset of relevant variables through
		a stepwise selection process.This approach is particularly
		useful for modeling spatially varying relationships and
		improving the accuracy of spatial predictions.
