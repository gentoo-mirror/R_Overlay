		Fitting and Simulating Mixtures of Watson Distributions // Tools
		for fitting and simulating mixtures of Watson distributions.
		The random sampling scheme of the package offers two sampling
		algorithms that are based of the results of Sablica, Hornik and
		Leydold (2022)
		https://research.wu.ac.at/en/publications/random-sampling-from-
		the-watson-distribution. What is more, the package offers a
		smart tool to combine these two methods, and based on the
		selected parameters, it approximates the relative sampling
		speed for both methods and picks the faster one. In addition,
		the package offers a fitting function for the mixtures of
		Watson distribution, that uses the expectation-maximization
		(EM) algorithm. Special features are the possibility to use
		multiple variants of the E-step and M-step, sparse matrices for
		the data representation and state of the art methods for
		numerical evaluation of needed special functions using the
		results of Sablica and Hornik (2022) https://www.ams.org/journa
		ls/mcom/2022-91-334/S0025-5718-2021-03690-X/.
