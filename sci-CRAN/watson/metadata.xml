		Fitting and Simulating Mixtures of Watson Distributions // Tools
		for fitting and simulating mixtures of Watson distributions.
		The random sampling scheme of the package offers two sampling
		algorithms that are based of the results of Sablica, Hornik and
		Leydold (2022) doi:10.1080/10618600.2024.2416521. What is more,
		the package offers a smart tool to combine these two methods,
		and based on the selected parameters, it approximates the
		relative sampling speed for both methods and picks the faster
		one. In addition, the package offers a fitting function for the
		mixtures of Watson distribution, that uses the expectation-
		maximization (EM) algorithm. Special features are the
		possibility to use multiple variants of the E-step and M-step,
		sparse matrices for the data representation and state of the
		art methods for numerical evaluation of needed special
		functions using the results of Sablica and Hornik (2022)
		doi:10.1090/mcom/3690 and Sablica and Hornik (2024)
