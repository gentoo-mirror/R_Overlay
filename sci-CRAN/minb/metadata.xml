		Multiple-Inflated Negative Binomial Model // Count data is
		prevalent and informative, with widespread application in many
		fields such as social psychology, personality, and public
		health. Classical statistical methods for the analysis of count
		outcomes are commonly variants of the log-linear model,
		including Poisson regression and Negative Binomial regression.
		However, a typical problem with count data modeling is
		inflation, in the sense that the counts are evidently
		accumulated on some integers. Such an inflation problem could
		distort the distribution of the observed counts, further bias
		estimation and increase error, making the classic methods
		infeasible. Traditional inflated value selection methods based
		on histogram inspection are easy to neglect true points and
		computationally expensive in addition. Therefore, we propose a
		multiple-inflated negative binomial model to handle count data
		modeling with multiple inflated values, achieving data-driven
		inflated value selection. The proposed approach provides
		simultaneous identification of important regression predictors
		on the target count response as well. More details about the
		proposed method are described in Li, Y., Wu, M., Wu, M.,  Ma,
		S. (2023) arXiv:2309.15585.
