		Generalized Additive Models with Flexible Response Functions //
		Standard generalized additive models assume a response
		function, which induces an assumption on the shape of the
		distribution of the response. However, miss-specifying the
		response function results in biased estimates. Therefore in
		Spiegel et al. (2017) doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9799-6 we propose
		to estimate the response function jointly with the covariate
		effects. This package provides the underlying functions to
		estimate these generalized additive models with flexible
		response functions. The estimation is based on an iterative
		algorithm. In the outer loop the response function is
		estimated, while in the inner loop the covariate effects are
		determined. For the response function a strictly monotone
		P-spline is used while the covariate effects are estimated
		based on a modified Fisher-Scoring algorithm. Overall the
		estimation relies on the 'mgcv'-package.
