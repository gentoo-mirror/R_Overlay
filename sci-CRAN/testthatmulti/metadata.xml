		Testing for R Packages with Multiple Attempts for Noisy Tests //
		Runs tests using the 'testthat' package but allows for multiple
		attempts for a single test. This is useful for noisy or flaky
		tests that generally pass but can fail due to occasional random
		errors, such as numeric instability or using random data.
