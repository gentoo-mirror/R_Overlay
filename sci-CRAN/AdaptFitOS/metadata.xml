		Adaptive Semiparametric Additive Regression with Simultaneous
		Confidence Bands and Specification Tests // Fits semiparametric
		additive regression models with spatially adaptive penalized
		splines and computes simultaneous confidence bands and
		associated specification (lack-of-fit) tests. Simultaneous
		confidence bands cover the entire curve with a prescribed level
		of confidence and allow us to assess the estimation uncertainty
		for the whole curve. In contrast to pointwise confidence bands,
		they permit statements about the statistical significance of
		certain features (e.g. bumps) in the underlying curve.The
		method allows for handling of spatially heterogeneous functions
		and their derivatives as well as heteroscedasticity in the
		data. See Wiesenfarth et al (2012)
