		Kernel Change Point Detection on the Running Statistics // The
		running statistics of interest is first extracted using a time
		window which is slid across the time series, and in each
		window, the running statistics value is computed. KCP (Kernel
		Change Point) detection proposed by Arlot et al. (2012)
		arXiv:1202.3878 is then implemented to flag the change points
		on the running statistics (Cabrieto et al., 2018,
		doi:10.1016/j.ins.2018.03.010). Change points are located by
		minimizing a variance criterion based on the pairwise
		similarities between running statistics which are computed via
		the Gaussian kernel. KCP can locate change points for a given k
		number of change points. To determine the optimal k, the KCP
		permutation test is first carried out by comparing the variance
		of the running statistics extracted from the original data to
		that of permuted data. If this test is significant, then there
		is sufficient evidence for at least one change point in the
		data. Model selection is then used to determine the optimal k0.
