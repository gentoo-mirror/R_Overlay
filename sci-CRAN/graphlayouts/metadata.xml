		Additional Layout Algorithms for Network Visualizations //
		Several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are
		provided which are not part of 'igraph'. Most are based on the
		concept of stress majorization by Gansner et al. (2004)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25. Some more specific algorithms
		allow to emphasize hidden group structures in networks or focus
		on specific nodes.
