		Canonical Correlation for Survey Data // Performs canonical
		correlation for survey data, including multiple tests of
		significance for secondary canonical correlations. A key
		feature of this package is that it incorporates survey data
		structure directly in a novel test of significance via a
		sequence of simple linear regression models on the canonical
		variates. See reference - Cruz-Cano, Cohen, and Mead-Morse
		(2024) "Canonical Correlation Analysis of Survey data: the
		SurveyCC R package" The R Journal under review.
