		Generalized Row-Column Designs // When the number of treatments
		is large with limited experimental resources then Row-
		Column(RC) designs with multiple units per cell can be used.
		These designs are called Generalized Row-Column (GRC) designs
		and are defined as designs with v treatments in p rows and q
		columns such that the intersection of each row and column
		(cell) consists of k experimental units. For example (Bailey
		Monod (2001)doi:10.1111/1467-9469.00235), to conduct an
		experiment for comparing 4 treatments using 4 plants with
		leaves at 2 different heights row-column design with two units
		per cell can be used. A GRC design is said to be structurally
		complete if corresponding to the intersection of each row and
		column, there appears at least two treatments. A GRC design is
		said to be structurally incomplete if corresponding to the
		intersection of any row and column, there is at least one cell
		which does not contain any treatment.
