		The Swiss Municipal Data Merger Tool Maps Municipalities Over
		Time // In Switzerland, the landscape of municipalities is
		changing rapidly mainly due to mergers. The Swiss Municipal
		Data Merger Tool automatically detects these mutations and maps
		municipalities over time, i.e. municipalities of an old state
		to municipalities of a new state. This functionality is helpful
		when working with datasets that are based on different spatial
		references. The package's idea and use case is discussed in the
		following article: doi:10.1111/spsr.12487.
