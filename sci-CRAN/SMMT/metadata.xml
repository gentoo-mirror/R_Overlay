		The Swiss Municipality Merger Tool Maps Municipalities Over Time
		// In Switzerland, the landscape of municipalities is changing
		rapidly mainly due to mergers. The Swiss Municipality Merger
		Tool automatically detects these mutations and maps
		municipalities over time, i.e. municipalities of an old state
		to municipalities of a new state. This functionality is helpful
		when working with datasets that are based on different spatial
		references. The spatial reference in this context signifies a
		set of municipalities at a given point in time.
