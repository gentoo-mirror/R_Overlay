		Active Learning for Process Monitoring // Implements the
		methodology introduced in Capezza, Lepore, and Paynabar (2025)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.2025.2561744 for process monitoring with
		limited labeling resources. The package provides functions to
		(i) simulate data streams with true latent states and
		multivariate Gaussian observations as done in the paper, (ii)
		fit partially hidden Markov models (pHMMs) using a constrained
		Baum-Welch algorithm with partial labels, and (iii) perform
		stream-based active learning that balances exploration and
		exploitation to decide whether to request labels in real time.
		The methodology is particularly suited for statistical process
		monitoring in industrial applications where labeling is costly.
