		Radiocarbon Dating, Age-Depth Modelling, Relative Sea Level Rate
		Estimation, and Non-Parametric Phase Modelling // Enables quick
		calibration of radiocarbon dates under various calibration
		curves (including user generated ones); age-depth modelling as
		per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008)
		DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x; Relative sea level rate
		estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial
		regression models (Parnell and Gehrels 2015)
		DOI:10.1002/9781118452547.ch32; non-parametric phase modelling
		via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine the activity of a
		site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function SUM;
		currently unpublished), and reverse calibration of dates from
		calibrated into un-calibrated years (also unpublished).
