		'Rcpp' Tic-Toc Timer with 'OpenMP' Support // Provides 'Rcpp'
		bindings for 'cpptimer', a simple tic-toc timer class for
		benchmarking 'C++' code https://github.com/BerriJ/cpptimer.
		It's not just simple, it's blazing fast! This sleek tic-toc
		timer class supports overlapping timers as well as 'OpenMP'
		parallelism https://www.openmp.org/. It boasts a microsecond-
		level time resolution. We did not find any overhead of the
		timer itself at this resolution. Results (with summary
		statistics) are automatically passed back to 'R' as a data
		frame.
