		Chaos Game // The main objective of the package is to enter a
		word of at least two letters based on which an Iterated
		Function System with Probabilities (IFSP) is constructed, and a
		two-dimensional fractal containing the chosen word infinitely
		often is generated via the Chaos Game. Additionally, the
		package allows to project the two-dimensional fractal on
		several three-dimensional surfaces and to transform the fractal
		into another fractal with uniform marginals.
