		Chaos Game // The main objective of the package is to enter a
		word of at least two letters based on which an Iterated
		Function System with Probabilities is constructed, and a two-
		dimensional fractal containing the chosen word infinitely often
		is generated via the Chaos Game. Additionally, the package
		allows to project the two-dimensional fractal on several three-
		dimensional surfaces and to transform the fractal into another
		fractal with uniform marginals.
