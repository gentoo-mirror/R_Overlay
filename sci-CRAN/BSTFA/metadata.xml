		Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Factor Analysis Model // Implements
		Bayesian spatio-temporal factor analysis models for
		multivariate data observed across space and time. The package
		provides tools for model fitting via Markov chain Monte Carlo
		(MCMC), spatial and temporal interpolation, and visualization
		of latent factors and loadings to support inference and
		exploration of underlying spatio-temporal patterns. Designed
		for use in environmental, ecological, or public health
		applications, with support for posterior prediction and
		uncertainty quantification. Includes functions such as BSTFA()
		for model fitting and plot_factor() to visualize the latent
		processes.  Functions are based on and extended from methods
		described in Berrett, et al. (2020) doi:10.1002/env.2609.
