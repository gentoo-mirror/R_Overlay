		Elastic Net Penalized Maximum Likelihood for Structural Equation
		Models with Network GPT Framework // Provides elastic net
		penalized maximum likelihood estimator for structural equation
		models (SEM). The package implements `lasso` and `elastic net`
		(l1/l2) penalized SEM and estimates the model parameters with
		an efficient block coordinate ascent algorithm that maximizes
		the penalized likelihood of the SEM.  Hyperparameters are
		inferred from cross-validation (CV).  A Stability Selection
		(STS) function is also available to provide accurate causal
		effect selection. The software achieves high accuracy
		performance through a `Network Generative Pre-trained
		Transformer` (Network GPT) Framework with two steps: 1) pre-
		trains the model to generate a complete (fully connected)
		graph; and 2) uses the complete graph as the initial state to
		fit the `elastic net` penalized SEM.
