		Goldilocks Adaptive Trial Designs for Time-to-Event Endpoints //
		Implements the Goldilocks adaptive trial design for a time to
		event outcome using a piecewise exponential model and conjugate
		Gamma prior distributions. The method closely follows the
		article by Broglio and colleagues
		doi:10.1080/10543406.2014.888569, which allows users to explore
		the operating characteristics of different trial designs.
