		Bayesian Meta-Analysis with Publications Bias and P-Hacking //
		Tools for Bayesian estimation of meta-analysis models that
		account for publications bias or p-hacking. For publication
		bias, this package implements a variant of the p-value based
		selection model of Hedges (1992) doi:10.1214/ss/1177011364 with
		discrete selection probabilities. It also implements the
		mixture of truncated normals model for p-hacking described in
		Moss and De Bin (2019) arXiv:1911.12445.
