		Perform JIVE Decomposition for Multi-Source Data // Performs the
		JIVE decomposition on a list of data sets when the data share a
		dimension, returning low-rank matrices that capture the joint
		and individual structure of the data [O'Connell, MJ and Lock,
		EF (2016) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw324]. It provides two
		methods of rank selection when the rank is unknown, a
		permutation test and a BIC selection algorithm. Also included
		in the package are three plotting functions for visualizing the
		variance attributed to each data source: a bar plot that shows
		the percentages of the variability attributable to joint and
		individual structure, a heatmap that shows the structure of the
		variability, and principal component plots.
