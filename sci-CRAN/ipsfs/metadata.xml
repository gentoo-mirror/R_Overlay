		Intuitionistic, Pythagorean, and Spherical Fuzzy Similarity
		Measure // Advanced fuzzy logic based techniques are
		implemented to compute the similarity among different objects
		or items. Typically, application areas consist of transforming
		raw data into the corresponding advanced fuzzy logic
		representation and determining the similarity between two
		objects using advanced fuzzy similarity techniques in various
		fields of research, such as text classification, pattern
		recognition, software projects, decision-making, medical
		diagnosis, and market prediction. Functions are designed to
		compute the membership, non-membership, hesitant-membership,
		indeterminacy-membership, and refusal-membership for the input
		matrices. Furthermore, it also includes a large number of
		advanced fuzzy logic based similarity measure functions to
		compute the Intuitionistic fuzzy similarity (IFS), Pythagorean
		fuzzy similarity (PFS), and Spherical fuzzy similarity (SFS)
		between two objects or items based on their fuzzy
		relationships. It also includes working examples for each
		function with sample data sets.
