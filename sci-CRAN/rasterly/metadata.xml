		Easily and Rapidly Generate Raster Image Data with Support for
		'Plotly.js' // It aims to easily and rapidly generate raster
		data in R, even for very large datasets, with an aesthetics-
		based mapping syntax that should be familiar to users of the
		'ggplot2' package. While 'rasterly' does not attempt to
		reproduce the full functionality of the 'Datashader' graphics
		pipeline system for Python, the 'rasterly' API has several core
		elements in common with that software package.
