		Harmonise and Integrate Heterogeneous Areal Data // Many relevant
		applications in the environmental and socioeconomic sciences
		use areal data, such as biodiversity checklists, agricultural
		statistics, or socioeconomic surveys. For applications that
		surpass the spatial, temporal or thematic scope of any single
		data source, data must be integrated from several heterogeneous
		sources. Inconsistent concepts, definitions, or messy data
		tables make this a tedious and error-prone process. 'arealDB'
		tackles those problems and helps the user to integrate a
		harmonised databases of areal data. Read the pre-print at
