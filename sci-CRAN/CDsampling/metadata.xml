		'CDsampling': Constraint Sampling in Paid Research Studies // In
		the context of paid research studies and clinical trials,
		budget considerations and patient sampling from available
		populations are subject to inherent constraints. We introduce
		the 'CDsampling' package, which integrates optimal design
		theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This
		package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal
		approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without
		constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find
		constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy with
		limited model information. Our package offers functions for the
		computation of the Fisher information matrix under generalized
		linear models (including regular linear regression model) and
		multinomial logistic models.To demonstrate the applications, we
		also provide a simulated dataset and a real dataset embedded in
		the package. Yifei Huang, Liping Tong, and Jie Yang
