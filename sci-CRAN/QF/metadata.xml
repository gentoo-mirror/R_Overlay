		Density, Cumulative and Quantile Functions of Quadratic Forms //
		The computation of quadratic form (QF) distributions is often
		not trivial and it requires numerical routines. The package
		contains functions aimed at evaluating the exact distribution
		of quadratic forms (QFs) and ratios of QFs. In particular, we
		propose to evaluate density, quantile and distribution
		functions of positive definite QFs and ratio of independent
		positive QFs by means of an algorithm based on the numerical
		inversion of Mellin transforms.
