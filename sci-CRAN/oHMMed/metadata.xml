		HMMs with Ordered Hidden States and Emission Densities //
		Inference using a class of Hidden Markov models (HMMs) called
		'oHMMed'(ordered HMM with emission densities
		doi:10.1186/s12859-024-05751-4): The 'oHMMed' algorithms
		identify the number of comparably homogeneous regions within
		observed sequences with autocorrelation patterns. These are
		modelled as discrete hidden states; the observed data points
		are then realisations of continuous probability distributions
		with state-specific means that enable ordering of these
		distributions. The observed sequence is labelled according to
		the hidden states, permitting only neighbouring states that are
		also neighbours within the ordering of their associated
		distributions. The parameters that characterise these state-
		specific distributions are then inferred. Relevant for
		application to genomic sequences, time series, or any other
		sequence data with serial autocorrelation.
