		Automated Intuitive Package for Meta-Ensemble Learning // Extends
		the base classes and methods of 'caret' package for integration
		of base learners. The user can input the number of different
		base learners, and specify the final learner, along with the
		train-validation-test data partition split ratio. The
		predictions on the unseen new data is the resultant of the
		ensemble meta-learning
		https://machinelearningmastery.com/stacking-ensemble-machine-
		learning-with-python/ of the heterogeneous learners aimed to
		reduce the generalization error in the predictive models. It
		significantly lowers the barrier for the practitioners to apply
		heterogeneous ensemble learning techniques in an amateur
		fashion to their everyday predictive problems.
