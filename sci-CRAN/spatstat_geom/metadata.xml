		Geometrical Functionality of the 'spatstat' Family // Defines
		spatial data types and supports geometrical operations on them.
		Data types include point patterns, windows (domains), pixel
		images, line segment patterns, tessellations and hyperframes.
		Capabilities include creation and manipulation of data (using
		command line or graphical interaction), plotting, geometrical
		operations (rotation, shift, rescale, affine transformation),
		convex hull, discretisation and pixellation, Dirichlet
		tessellation, Delaunay triangulation, pairwise distances,
		nearest-neighbour distances, distance transform, morphological
		operations (erosion, dilation, closing, opening), quadrat
		counting, geometrical measurement, geometrical covariance,
		colour maps, calculus on spatial domains, Gaussian blur, level
		sets of images, transects of images, intersections between
		objects, minimum distance matching. (Excludes spatial data on a
		network, which are supported by the package 'spatstat.linnet'.)
