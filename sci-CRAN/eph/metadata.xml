		Argentina's Permanent Household Survey Data and Manipulation
		Utilities // Tools to download and manipulate the Permanent
		Household Survey from Argentina (EPH is the Spanish acronym for
		Permanent Household Survey). e.g: get_microdata() for
		downloading the datasets, get_poverty_lines() for downloading
		the official poverty baskets, calculate_poverty() for the
		calculation of stating if a household is in poverty or not,
		following the official methodology. organize_panels() is used
		to concatenate observations from different periods, and
		organize_labels() adds the official labels to the data. The
		implemented methods are based on INDEC (2016) http://www.estadi
		stica.ec.gba.gov.ar/dpe/images/SOCIEDAD/EPH_metodologia_22_pobr
		eza.pdf. As this package works with the argentinian Permanent
		Household Survey and its main audience is from this country,
		the documentation was written in Spanish.
