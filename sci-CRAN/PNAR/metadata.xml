		Poisson Network Autoregressive Models // Quasi likelihood-based
		methods for estimating Poisson Network Autoregression with p
		lags, PNAR, following generalized linear models are provided.
		PNAR models with the identity and with the logarithmic link
		function are allowed. The inclusion of exogenous covariates is
		also possible. Moreover, it provides tools for testing the
		linearity of linear PNAR model versus several nonlinear
		alternatives. Finally, it allows generating multivariate count
		distributions, from linear and nonlinear PNAR models, where the
		dependence between Poisson random variables is generated by
		suitable copulas. References include: Armillotta, M. and K.
