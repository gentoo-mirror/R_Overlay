		Probability Theory for Selecting Candidates in Plant Breeding //
		Use probability theory under the Bayesian framework for
		calculating the risk of selecting candidates in a multi-
		environment context. Contained are functions used to fit a
		Bayesian multi-environment model (based on the available
		presets), extract posterior values and maximum posterior
		values, compute the variance components, check the models
		convergence, and calculate the probabilities. For both across
		and within-environments scopes, the package computes the
		probability of superior performance and the pairwise
		probability of superior performance. Furthermore, the
		probability of superior stability and the pairwise probability
		of superior stability across environments is estimated. A joint
		probability of superior performance and stability is also
		provided.
