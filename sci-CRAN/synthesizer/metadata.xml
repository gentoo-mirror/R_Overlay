		Synthesize Data Based on Emperical Multivariate Distributions and
		Rank Order Matching // Data is synthesized using a combination
		of inverse transform sampling from the emperical quantile
		functions for each variable, and then copying the rank order
		structure from the original dataset. The package also includes
		a number of functions to measure the utility of synthesized
		datasets.
