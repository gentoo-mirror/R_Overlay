		Synthesize Data Based on Empirical Quantile Functions and Rank
		Order Matching // Data is synthesized using a combination of
		inverse transform sampling using the empirical quantile
		functions for each variable, and then copying the rank order
		structure from the original dataset. The syntesizer method has
		a tunable parameter allowing to gradually move from realistic
		and possibly unsafe synthetic data to decorrelated data of less
		utility.
