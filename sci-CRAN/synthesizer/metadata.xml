		Fast, Robust, and High-Quality Synthetic Data Generation with a
		Tuneable Privacy-Utility Trade-Off // Synthesize numeric,
		categorical, mixed and time series data. Data circumstances
		including mixed (or zero-inflated) distributions and missing
		data patterns are reproduced in the synthetic data. A single
		parameter allows balancing between high-quality synthetic data
		that represents correlations of the original data and lower
		quality but more privacy safe synthetic data without
		correlations. Tuning can be done per variable or for the whole
		dataset.
