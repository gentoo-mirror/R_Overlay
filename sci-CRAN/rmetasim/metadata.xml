		An Individual-Based Population Genetic Simulation Environment //
		An interface between R and the metasim simulation engine. The
		simulation environment is documented in: "A Strand. Metasim
		1.0: an individual-based environment for simulating population
		genetics of complex population dynamics. Mol. Ecol. Notes,
		2:373-376, 2002". The current version has eliminated the
		backend encoded output routines. These routines were accessed
		using "landscape.write.foreign".  Now only output to GenePop
		files remains. R based routines for population genetic data
		analysis have improved dramatically and many can use the
		'genind' format defined by the adegenet package. There is now a
		new function called "landscape.make.genind" which converts a
		landscape to a genind object.  Please contact the maintainer if
		other output formats are needed.
