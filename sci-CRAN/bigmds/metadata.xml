		Multidimensional Scaling for Big Data // MDS is a statistic tool
		for reduction of dimensionality, using as input a distance
		matrix of dimensions n  n. When n is large, classical
		algorithms suffer from computational problems and MDS
		configuration can not be obtained. With this package, we
		address these problems by means of six algorithms, being two of
		them original proposals: - Landmark MDS proposed by De Silva V.
		and JB. Tenenbaum (2004). - Interpolation MDS proposed by
		Delicado P. and C. Pachn-Garca (2021) arXiv:2007.11919
		(original proposal). - Reduced MDS proposed by Paradis E
		(2018). - Pivot MDS proposed by Brandes U. and C. Pich (2007) -
		Divide-and-conquer MDS proposed by Delicado P. and C. Pachn-
		Garca (2021) arXiv:2007.11919 (original proposal). - Fast MDS,
		proposed by Yang, T., J. Liu, L. McMillan and W. Wang (2006).
