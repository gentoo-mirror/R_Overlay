		Multidimensional Scaling for Big Data // We present a set of
		algorithms for Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to be used with
		large datasets. MDS is a statistic tool for reduction of
		dimensionality, using as input a distance matrix of dimensions
		n  n. When n is large, classical algorithms suffer from
		computational problems and MDS configuration can not be
		obtained. With this package, we address these problems by means
		of three algorithms: Divide and Conquer MDS, Fast MDS and MDS
		based on Gower interpolation. The main idea of these methods is
		based on partitioning the dataset into small pieces, where
		classical methods can work.
