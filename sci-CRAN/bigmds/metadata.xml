		Multidimensional Scaling for Big Data // MDS is a statistic tool
		for reduction of dimensionality, using as input a distance
		matrix of dimensions n  n. When n is large, classical
		algorithms suffer from computational problems and MDS
		configuration can not be obtained. With this package, we
		address these problems by means of three algorithms: - Divide-
		and-conquer MDS developed by Delicado P. and C. Pachon-Garcia
		(2021) arXiv:2007.11919. - Fast MDS, which is an implementation
		of Yang, T., J. Liu, L. McMillan, and W. Wang (2006). -
		Interpolation MDS, which uses Gower's interpolation formula as
		described in Gower, J. C. and D. J. Hand (1995, ISBN:
		978-0-412-71630-0). The main idea of these algorithms is based
		on partitioning the data set into small pieces, where classical
		methods can work. In order to align all the solutions, it is
		used Procrustes formula as described in Borg, I. and P. Groenen
		(2005, ISBN : 978-0-387-25150-9).
