		Multidimensional Scaling for Big Data // MDS is a statistic tool
		for reduction of dimensionality, using as input a distance
		matrix of dimensions n  n. When n is large, classical
		algorithms suffer from computational problems and MDS
		configuration can not be obtained. With this package, we
		address these problems by means of three algorithms: - Divide
		and Conquer MDS developed by Delicado and Pachon-Garcia, (2020)
		arXiv:2007.11919. - Fast MDS, which is an implementation of
		Tynia, Y., L. Jinze, M. Leonard, and W. Wei, (2006). - MDS
		based on Gower interpolation, which uses Gower interpolation
		formula as described in Gower, J.C. and D.J, Hand (1995, ISBN:
		978-0-412-71630-0). The main idea of these methods is based on
		partitioning the dataset into small pieces, where classical
		methods can work. In order to align all the solutions, it is
		used Procrustes formula as described in Borg, I. and Groenen,
		P. (2005, ISBN : 978-0-387-25150-9).
