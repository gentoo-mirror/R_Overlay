		Holistic Multimodel Domain Analysis for Exploratory Machine
		Learning // Holistic Multimodel Domain Analysis (HMDA) is a
		robust and transparent framework designed for exploratory
		machine learning research, aiming to enhance the process of
		feature assessment and selection. HMDA addresses key
		limitations of traditional machine learning methods by
		evaluating the consistency across multiple high-performing
		models within a fine-tuned modeling grid, thereby improving the
		interpretability and reliability of feature importance
		assessments. Specifically, it computes Weighted Mean SHapley
		Additive exPlanations (WMSHAP), which aggregate feature
		contributions from multiple models based on weighted
		performance metrics. HMDA also provides confidence intervals to
		demonstrate the stability of these feature importance
		estimates. This framework is particularly beneficial for
		analyzing complex, multidimensional datasets common in health
		research, supporting reliable exploration of mental health
		outcomes such as suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and other
		psychological conditions. Additionally, HMDA includes automated
		procedures for feature selection based on WMSHAP ratios and
		performs dimension reduction analyses to identify underlying
		structures among features. For more details see Haghish (2025)
