		A Phylogenetic Simulator for Reticulate Evolution // A simulator
		for reticulate evolution under a birth-death-hybridization
		process. Here the birth-death process is extended to consider
		reticulate Evolution by allowing hybridization events to occur.
		The general purpose simulator allows the modeling of three
		different reticulate patterns: lineage generative
		hybridization, lineage neutral hybridization, and lineage
		degenerative hybridization. Users can also specify
		hybridization events to be dependent on a trait value or
		genetic distance. We also extend some phylogenetic tree utility
		and plotting functions for networks. We allow two different
		stopping conditions: simulated to a fixed time or number of
		taxa. When simulating to a fixed number of taxa, the user can
		simulate under the Generalized Sampling Approach that properly
		simulates phylogenies when assuming a uniform prior on the root
		age.
