		Selection Threshold Optimized Empirically via Splitting //
		Implements variable selection procedures for low to moderate
		size generalized linear regressions models. It includes the
		STOPES functions for linear regression (Capanu M, Giurcanu M,
		Begg C, Gonen M, Optimized variable selection via repeated data
		splitting, Statistics in Medicine, 2020, 19(6):2167-2184) as
		well as subsampling based optimization methods for generalized
		linear regression models (Marinela Capanu, Mihai Giurcanu,
		Colin B Begg, Mithat Gonen, Subsampling based variable
		selection for generalized linear models).
