		Selection Threshold Optimized Empirically via Splitting // A
		variable selection procedure for low to moderate size linear
		regressions models. This method repeatedly splits the data into
		two sets, one for estimation and one for validation, to obtain
		an empirically optimized threshold which is then used to screen
		for variables to include in the final model.
