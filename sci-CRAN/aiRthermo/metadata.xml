		Atmospheric Thermodynamics and Visualization // Deals with many
		computations related to the thermodynamics of atmospheric
		processes. It includes many functions designed to consider the
		density of air with varying degrees of water vapour in it,
		saturation pressures and mixing ratios, conversion of moisture
		indices, computation of atmospheric states of parcels subject
		to dry or pseudoadiabatic vertical evolutions and atmospheric
		instability indices that are routinely used for operational
		weather forecasts or meteorological diagnostics.
