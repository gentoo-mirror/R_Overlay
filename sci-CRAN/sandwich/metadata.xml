		Robust Covariance Matrix Estimators // Object-oriented software
		for model-robust covariance matrix estimators. Starting out
		from the basic robust Eicker-Huber-White sandwich covariance
		methods include: heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) covariances
		for cross-section data; heteroscedasticity- and
		autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) covariances for time series
		data (such as Andrews' kernel HAC, Newey-West, and WEAVE
		estimators); clustered covariances (one-way and multi-way);
		panel and panel-corrected covariances; outer-product-of-
		gradients covariances; and (clustered) bootstrap covariances.
		All methods are applicable to (generalized) linear model
		objects fitted by lm() and glm() but can also be adapted to
		other classes through S3 methods. Details can be found in
