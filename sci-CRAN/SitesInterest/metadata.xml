		Inferring an Animal's Sites of Interest from High Resolution Data
		// Within the area of movement ecology, it can be useful to
		identify an animal's sites of interest. These will be places
		that an animal uses a lot and so will spend a proportionately
		longer time there. The aim of this package is to identify both
		the position and size of these sites of interest from high
		resolution (sub-second) positional data.
