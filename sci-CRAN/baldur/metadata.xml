		Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling for Label-Free Proteomics //
		Statistical decision in proteomics data using a hierarchical
		Bayesian model. There are two regression models for describing
		the mean-variance trend, a gamma regression or a latent gamma
		mixture regression. The regression model is then used as an
		Empirical Bayes estimator for the prior on the variance in a
		peptide. Further, it assumes that each measurement has an
		uncertainty (increased variance) associated with it that is
		also inferred. Finally, it tries to estimate the posterior
		distribution (by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) for the differences
		in means for each peptide in the data. Once the posterior is
		inferred, it integrates the tails to estimate the probability
		of error from which a statistical decision can be made.
