		Fetch Zonal Statistics of Weather Indicators for Brazilian
		Municipalities // Fetches zonal statistics from weather
		indicators that were calculated for each municipality in Brazil
		using data from the BR-DWGD and TerraClimate projects. Zonal
		statistics such as mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation,
		and sum were computed by taking into account the data cells
		that intersect the boundaries of each municipality and stored
		in Parquet files. This procedure was carried out for all
		Brazilian municipalities, and for all available dates, for
		every indicator available in the weather products (BR-DWGD and
		TerraClimate projects). This package queries on-line the
		already calculated statistics on the Parquet files and returns
		easy-to-use data.frames.
