		Simulation of Correlated Data with Multiple Variable Types //
		Generate continuous (normal or non-normal), binary, ordinal,
		and count (Poisson or Negative Binomial) variables with a
		specified correlation matrix.  It can also produce a single
		continuous variable.  This package can be used to simulate data
		sets that mimic real-world situations (i.e. clinical or genetic
		data sets, plasmodes).  All variables are generated from
		standard normal variables with an imposed intermediate
		correlation matrix.  Continuous variables are simulated by
		specifying mean, variance, skewness, standardized kurtosis, and
		fifth and sixth standardized cumulants using either Fleishman's
		third-order (DOI:10.1007/BF02293811) or Headrick's fifth-order
		(DOI:10.1016/S0167-9473(02)00072-5) polynomial transformation.
		Binary and ordinal variables are simulated using a modification
		of the ordsample() function from 'GenOrd'. Count variables are
		simulated using the inverse cdf method.  There are two
		simulation pathways which differ primarily according to the
		calculation of the intermediate correlation matrix.  In
		Correlation Method 1, the intercorrelations involving count
		variables are determined using a simulation based, logarithmic
		correlation correction (adapting Yahav and Shmueli's 2012
		method, DOI:10.1002/asmb.901).  In Correlation Method 2, the
		count variables are treated as ordinal (adapting Barbiero and
		Ferrari's 2015 modification of GenOrd, DOI:10.1002/asmb.2072).
		There is an optional error loop that corrects the final
		correlation matrix to be within a user-specified precision
		value of the target matrix.  The package also includes
		functions to calculate standardized cumulants for theoretical
		distributions or from real data sets, check if a target
		correlation matrix is within the possible correlation bounds
		(given the distributions of the simulated variables), summarize
		results (numerically or graphically), to verify valid power
		method pdfs, and to calculate lower standardized kurtosis
		bounds.
