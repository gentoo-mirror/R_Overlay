		Analysis of Coarsely Observed Data // Functions to analyze coarse
		data. Specifically, it contains functions to (1) fit parametric
		accelerated failure time models to interval-censored survival
		time data, and (2) estimate the case-fatality ratio in
		scenarios with under-reporting. This package's development was
		motivated by applications to infectious disease: in particular,
		problems with estimating the incubation period and the case
		fatality ratio of a given disease.  Sample data files are
		included in the package. See Reich et al. (2009)
