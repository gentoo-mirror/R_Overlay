		A User-Friendly R 'shiny' Application for Multi-Omics Data
		Integration and Analysis // A 'shiny' application, which allows
		you to perform single- and multi-omics analyses using your own
		omics datasets. After the upload of the omics datasets and a
		metadata file, single-omics is performed for feature selection
		and dataset reduction. These datasets are used for pairwise-
		and multi-omics analyses, where automatic tuning is done to
		identify correlations between the datasets - the end goal of
		the recommended 'Holomics' workflow. Methods used in the
		package were implemented in the package 'mixomics' by Florian
		Rohart,Benot Gautier,Amrit Singh,Kim-Anh L Cao (2017)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005752 and are described there in
		further detail.
