		Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data Analyzer // Contains all of
		the functions necessary for the complete analysis of a
		continuous glucose monitoring study and can be applied to data
		measured by various existing CGM devices such as FreeStyle
		Libre, Glutalor, Dexcom and Medtronic CGM. It reads a series of
		data files, is able to convert various formats of time stamps,
		can deal with missing values, calculates both regular
		statistics and nonlinear statistics, and conducts group
		comparison. It also displays results in a concise format. Also
		contains two unique features new to CGM analysis: one is the
		implementation of strictly standard mean difference and the
		class of effect size; the other is the development of a new
		type of plot called antenna plot.
