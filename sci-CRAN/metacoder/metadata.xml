		Tools for Parsing, Manipulating, and Graphing Taxonomic Abundance
		Data // Reads, plots, and manipulates large taxonomic data
		sets, like those generated from modern high-throughput
		sequencing, such as metabarcoding (i.e. amplification
		metagenomics, 16S metagenomics, etc). It provides a tree-based
		visualization called "heat trees" used to depict statistics for
		every taxon in a taxonomy using color and size. It also
		provides various functions to do common tasks in microbiome
		bioinformatics on data in the 'taxmap' format defined by the
		'taxa' package. The 'metacoder' package is described in the
		publication by Foster et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005404.
