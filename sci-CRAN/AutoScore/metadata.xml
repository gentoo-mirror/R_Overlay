		An Interpretable Machine Learning-Based Automatic Clinical Score
		Generator // A novel interpretable machine learning-based
		framework to automate the development of a clinical scoring
		model for predefined outcomes. Our novel framework consists of
		six modules: variable ranking with machine learning, variable
		transformation, score derivation, model selection, domain
		knowledge-based score fine-tuning, and performance
		evaluation.The The original AutoScore structure is described in
		the research paperdoi:10.2196/21798. A full tutorial can be
		found herehttps://nliulab.github.io/AutoScore/. Users or
		clinicians could seamlessly generate parsimonious sparse-score
		risk models (i.e., risk scores), which can be easily
		implemented and validated in clinical practice. We hope to see
		its application in various medical case studies.
