		Empirical Likelihood for General Block Designs // Performs
		hypothesis testing for general block designs with empirical
		likelihood. The core computational routines are implemented
		using the 'Eigen' 'C++' library and 'RcppEigen' interface, with
		'OpenMP' for parallel computation. Details of the methods are
		given in Kim, MacEachern, and Peruggia (2023)
		doi:10.1080/10485252.2023.2206919. This work was supported by
		the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants No.
