		Sensitivity Analysis for p-Hacking in Meta-Analyses // Fits
		right-truncated meta-analysis (RTMA), a bias correction for the
		joint effects of p-hacking (i.e., manipulation of results
		within studies to obtain significant, positive estimates) and
		traditional publication bias (i.e., the selective publication
		of studies with significant, positive results) in meta-analyses
		[see Mathur MB (2022). "Sensitivity analysis for p-hacking in
		meta-analyses." doi:10.31219/osf.io/ezjsx.]. Unlike publication
		bias alone, p-hacking that favors significant, positive results
		(termed "affirmative") can distort the distribution of
		affirmative results. To bias-correct results from affirmative
		studies would require strong assumptions on the exact nature of
		p-hacking. In contrast, joint p-hacking and publication bias do
		not distort the distribution of published nonaffirmative
		results when there is stringent p-hacking (e.g., investigators
		who hack always eventually obtain an affirmative result) or
		when there is stringent publication bias (e.g., nonaffirmative
		results from hacked studies are never published). This means
		that any published nonaffirmative results are from unhacked
		studies. Under these assumptions, RTMA involves analyzing only
		the published nonaffirmative results to essentially impute the
		full underlying distribution of all results prior to selection
		due to p-hacking and/or publication bias. The package also
		provides diagnostic plots described in Mathur (2022).
