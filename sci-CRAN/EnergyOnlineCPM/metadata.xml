		Distribution Free Multivariate Control Chart Based on Energy Test
		// Provides a function for distribution free control chart
		based on the change point model, for multivariate statistical
		process control. The main constituent of the chart is the
		energy test that focuses on the discrepancy between empirical
		characteristic functions of two random vectors. This new
		control chart highlights in three aspects. Firstly, it is
		distribution free, requiring no knowledge of the random
		processes. Secondly, this control chart can monitor mean and
		variance simultaneously. Thirdly it is devised for multivariate
		time series which is more practical in real data application.
		Fourthly, it is designed for online detection (Phase II), which
		is central for real time surveillance of stream data. For more
		information please refer to O. Okhrin and Y.F. Xu (2017)
