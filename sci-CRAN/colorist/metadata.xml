		Coloring Wildlife Distributions in Space-Time // Color and
		visualize wildlife distributions in space-time using raster
		data. In addition to enabling display of sequential change in
		distributions through the use of small multiples, 'colorist'
		provides functions for extracting several features of interest
		from a sequence of distributions and for visualizing those
		features using HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color palettes.
		Resulting maps allow for "fair" visual comparison of intensity
		values (e.g., occurrence, abundance, or density) across space
		and time and can be used to address questions about where,
		when, and how consistently a species, group, or individual is
		likely to be found.
