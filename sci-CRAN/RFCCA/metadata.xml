		Random Forest with Canonical Correlation Analysis // Random
		Forest with Canonical Correlation Analysis (RFCCA) is a random
		forest method for estimating the canonical correlations between
		two sets of variables depending on the subject-related
		covariates. The trees are built with a splitting rule
		specifically designed to partition the data to maximize the
		canonical correlation heterogeneity between child nodes. The
		method is described in Alakus et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab158. RFCCA uses
		'randomForestSRC' package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2020) by
		freezing at the version 2.9.3. The custom splitting rule
		feature is utilised to apply the proposed splitting rule.
		LAPACK and BLAS libraries are used for matrix decompositions.
		The RFCCA package includes the header files lapacke.h and
		cblas.h from the LAPACK and BLAS libraries. The LAPACK library
		is licensed under modified BSD license.
