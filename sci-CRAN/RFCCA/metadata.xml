		Random Forest with Canonical Correlation Analysis // Random
		Forest with Canonical Correlation Analysis (RFCCA) is a random
		forest method for estimating the canonical correlations between
		two sets of variables depending on the subject-related
		covariates. The trees are built with a splitting rule
		specifically designed to partition the data to maximize the
		canonical correlation heterogeneity between child nodes. The
		method is described in Alakus et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab158. 'RFCCA' uses
		'randomForestSRC' package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2020) by
		freezing at the version 2.9.3. The custom splitting rule
		feature is utilised to apply the proposed splitting rule. The
		'randomForestSRC' package implements 'OpenMP' by default,
		contingent upon the support provided by the target architecture
		and operating system. In this package, 'LAPACK' and 'BLAS'
		libraries are used for matrix decompositions.
