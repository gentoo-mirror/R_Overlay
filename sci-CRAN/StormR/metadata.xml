		Analyzing the Behaviour of Wind Generated by Tropical Storms and
		Cyclones // Set of functions to quantify and map the behaviour
		of winds generated by tropical storms and cyclones in space and
		time. It includes functions to compute and analyze fields such
		as the maximum sustained wind field, power dissipation index
		and duration of exposure to winds above a given threshold. It
		also includes functions to map the trajectories as well as
		characteristics of the storms.
