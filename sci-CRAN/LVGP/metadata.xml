		Latent Variable Gaussian Process Modeling with Qualitative and
		Quantitative Input Variables // Fit response surfaces for
		datasets with latent-variable Gaussian process modeling,
		predict responses for new inputs, and plot latent variables
		locations in the latent space (1D or 2D). The input variables
		of the datasets can be quantitative, qualitative/categorical or
		mixed. The output variable of the datasets is a scalar
		(quantitative). The method is published in "A Latent Variable
		Approach to Gaussian Process Modeling with Qualitative and
		Quantitative Factors" by Yichi Zhang, Siyu Tao, Wei Chen, and
		Daniel W. Apley (2018) arXiv:1806.07504.
