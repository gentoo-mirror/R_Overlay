		Estimators and Plots for Gamma and Pareto Tail Detection //
		Estimators for two functionals used to detect Gamma, Pareto or
		Lognormal distributions, as well as distributions exhibiting
		similar tail behavior, as introduced by Iwashita and Klar
		(2023) doi:10.1111/stan.12316 and Klar (2024)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2024.2413081. One of these functionals, g,
		originally proposed by Asmussen and Lehtomaa (2017)
		doi:10.3390/risks5010010, distinguishes between log-convex and
		log-concave tail behavior. Furthermore the characterization of
		the lognormal distribution is based on the work of Mosimann
		(1970) doi:10.2307/2284599. The package also includes methods
		for visualizing these estimators and their associated
		confidence intervals across various threshold values.
