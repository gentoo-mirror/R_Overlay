		Microbiome Analysis Tools // We provide functions for identifying
		the core community phylogeny in any microbiome, drawing
		phylogenetic Venn diagrams, calculating the core Faiths PD for
		a set of communities, and calculating the core UniFrac distance
		between two sets of communities. All functions rely on
		construction of a core community phylogeny, which is a
		phylogeny where branches are defined based on their presence in
		multiple samples from a single type of habitat. Our package
		provides two options for constructing the core community
		phylogeny, a tip-based approach, where the core community
		phylogeny is identified based on incidence of leaf nodes and a
		branch-based approach, where the core community phylogeny is
		identified based on incidence of individual branches. We
		suggest use of the microViz package.
