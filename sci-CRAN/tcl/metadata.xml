		Testing in Conditional Likelihood Context // An implementation of
		hypothesis testing in an extended Rasch modelling framework,
		including sample size planning procedures and power
		computations. Provides 4 statistical tests, i.e., gradient test
		(GR), likelihood ratio test (LR), Rao score or Lagrange
		multiplier test (RS), and Wald test, for testing a number of
		hypotheses referring to the Rasch model (RM), linear logistic
		test model (LLTM), rating scale model (RSM), and partial credit
		model (PCM). Three types of functions for power and sample size
		computations are provided. Firstly, functions to compute the
		sample size given a user-specified (predetermined) deviation
		from the hypothesis to be tested, the level alpha, and the
		power of the test. Secondly, functions to evaluate the power of
		the tests given a user-specified (predetermined) deviation from
		the hypothesis to be tested, the level alpha of the test, and
		the sample size. Thirdly, functions to evaluate the so-called
		post hoc power of the tests. This is the power of the tests
		given the observed deviation of the data from the hypothesis to
		be tested and a user-specified level alpha of the test. Power
		and sample size computations are based on a Monte Carlo
		simulation approach. It is computationally very efficient. The
		variance of the random error in computing power and sample size
		arising from the simulation approach is analytically derived by
		using the delta method. Draxler, C.,  Alexandrowicz, R. W.
