		Shed Light on Black Box Machine Learning Models // Shed light on
		black box machine learning models by the help of model
		performance, permutation variable importance (Fisher et al.
		(2018) arxiv:1801.01489), ICE profiles, partial dependence
		(Friedman J. H. (2001) doi:10.1214/aos/1013203451), accumulated
		local effects (Apley D. W. (2016) arXiv:1612.08468), further
		effects plots, interaction strength, and variable contribution
		breakdown (approximate SHAP) for single observations (Gosiewska
		and Biecek (2019) arxiv:1903.11420). All tools are implemented
		to work with case weights and allow for stratified analysis.
		Furthermore, multiple flashlights can be combined and analyzed
		together.
