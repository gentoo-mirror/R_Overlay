		Shed Light on Black Box Machine Learning Models // Shed light on
		black box machine learning models by the help of model
		performance, permutation variable importance (Fisher et al.
		(2018) arxiv.org/abs/1801.01489), ICE profiles, partial
		dependence (Friedman J. H. (2001)
		doi.org/10.1214/aos/1013203451), and further effects plots. All
		tools are implemented to work with case weights and allow for
		stratified analysis. Furthermore, multiple flashlights can be
		combined and analyzed together.
