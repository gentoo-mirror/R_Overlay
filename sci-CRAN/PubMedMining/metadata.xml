		Text-Mining of the 'PubMed' Repository // Easy function for text-
		mining the 'PubMed' repository based on defined sets of terms.
		The relationship between fix-terms (related to your research
		topic) and pub-terms (terms which pivot around your research
		focus) is calculated using the pointwise mutual information
		algorithm ('PMI'). Church, Kenneth Ward and Hanks, Patrick
		(1990) https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J90-1003/ A text file
		is generated with the 'PMI'-scores for each fix-term. Then for
		each collocation pairs (a fix-term + a pub-term), a text file
		is generated with related article titles and publishing years.
		Additional Author section will follow in the next version
		updates.
