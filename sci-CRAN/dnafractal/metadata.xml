		Generates a Fractal Image of a DNA Sequence // The function takes
		a DNA sequence, a start point, an end point in the sequence,
		dot size and dot color and draws a fractal image of the
		sequence. The fractal starts in the center of the canvas. The
		image is drawn by moving base by base along the sequence and
		dropping a midpoint between the actual point and the corner
		designated by the actual base. For more details see Jeffrey
