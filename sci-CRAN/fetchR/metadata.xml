		Calculate Wind Fetch // Wind fetch is the unobstructed length of
		water over which wind can blow from a certain direction. The
		wind fetch is typically calculated for many directions around
		the compass rose for a given location, which can then be
		incorporated into a larger model (such as the InVEST coastal
		vulnerability model; http://data.naturalcapitalproject.org
		/invest-
		releases/documentation/2_2_0/coastal_vulnerability.html), or
		simply averaged for a reasonable measure of the overall wind
		exposure for a specific marine location. The process of
		calculating wind fetch can be extremely time-consuming and
		tedious, particularly if a large number of fetch vectors are
		required at many locations. The 'fetchR' package calculates
		wind fetch and summarises the information efficiently. There
		are also plot methods to help visualise the wind exposure at
		the various locations, and methods to output the fetch vectors
		to a KML file for further investigation.
