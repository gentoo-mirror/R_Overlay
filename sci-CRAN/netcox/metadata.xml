		Structural Learning in Cox Models with Time-Dependent Covariates
		// Efficient procedures for fitting and cross-validating the
		overlapping group Lasso (implemented in C++) for Cox models
		with time-dependent covariates. The penalty term is a weighted
		sum of infinity norms of (overlapping) groups of coefficients,
		which can select variables structurally with a specific
		grouping structure.
