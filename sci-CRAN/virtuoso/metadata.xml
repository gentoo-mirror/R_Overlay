		Interface to 'Virtuoso' using 'ODBC' // Provides users with a
		simple and convenient mechanism to manage and query a
		'Virtuoso' database using the 'DBI' (Data-Base Interface)
		compatible 'ODBC' (Open Database Connectivity) interface.
		'Virtuoso' is a high-performance "universal server," which can
		act as both a relational database, supporting standard
		Structured Query Language ('SQL') queries, while also
		supporting data following the Resource Description Framework
		('RDF') model for Linked Data. 'RDF' data can be queried using
		'SPARQL' ('SPARQL' Protocol and 'RDF' Query Language) queries,
		a graph-based query that supports semantic reasoning. This
		allows users to leverage the performance of local or remote
		'Virtuoso' servers using popular 'R' packages such as 'DBI' and
		'dplyr', while also providing a high-performance solution for
		working with large 'RDF' 'triplestores' from 'R.' The package
		also provides helper routines to install, launch, and manage a
		'Virtuoso' server locally on 'Mac', 'Windows' and 'Linux'
		platforms using the standard interactive installers from the
		'R' command-line.  By automatically handling these setup steps,
		the package can make using 'Virtuoso' considerably faster and
		easier for a most users to deploy in a local environment.
		Managing the bulk import of triples from common serializations
		with a single intuitive command is another key feature of this
		package.  Bulk import performance can be tens to hundreds of
		times faster than the comparable imports using existing 'R'
		tools, including 'rdflib' and 'redland' packages.
