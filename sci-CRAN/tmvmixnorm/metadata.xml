		Sampling from Truncated Multivariate Normal and t Distributions
		// Efficient sampling of truncated multivariate (scale)
		mixtures of normals under linear inequality constraints is
		nontrivial due to the analytically intractable normalizing
		constant. Meanwhile, traditional methods may subject to
		numerical issues, especially when the dimension is high and
		dependence is strong.    Algorithms proposed by Li and Ghosh
		(2015) doi: 10.1080/15598608.2014.996690 are adopted for
		overcoming difficulties in simulating truncated distributions.
		Efficient rejection sampling for simulating truncated
		univariate normal distribution is included in the package,
		which shows superiority in terms of acceptance rate and
		numerical stability compared to existing methods and R
		packages. An efficient function for sampling from truncated
		multivariate normal distribution subject to convex polytope
		restriction regions based on Gibbs sampler for conditional
		truncated univariate distribution is provided. By extending the
		sampling method, a function for sampling truncated multivariate
		Student's t distribution is also developed.     Moreover, the
		proposed method and computation remain valid for high
		dimensional and strong dependence scenarios. Empirical results
		in Li and Ghosh (2015) doi: 10.1080/15598608.2014.996690
		illustrated the superior performance in terms of various
		criteria (e.g. mixing and integrated auto-correlation time).
