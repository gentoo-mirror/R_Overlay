		Collection of Data Structures // A collection of simple
		simulation datasets designed for generating Nonlinear Dimension
		Reduction representations techniques such as t-distributed
		Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, and Uniform Manifold
		Approximation and Projection. These datasets serve as a
		valuable resource for understanding the reliability of
		Nonlinear Dimension Reduction representations in various
		contexts.
