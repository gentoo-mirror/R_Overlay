		Extension to the 'Lolog' Package for 'Triadic' Network Statistics
		// Provides an extension to the 'lolog' package by introducing
		the minTriadicClosure() statistic to capture higher-order
		interactions among triplets of nodes. This function facilitates
		improved modelling of group formations and 'triadic' closure in
		networks. A smoothing parameter has been incorporated to avoid
		numerical errors.
