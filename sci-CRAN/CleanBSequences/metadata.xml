		Curing of Biological Sequences // Curates biological sequences
		massively, quickly, without errors and without internet
		connection.  Biological sequences curing is performed by
		aligning the forward and / or revers primers or ends of cloning
		vectors with the sequences to be cleaned. After the alignment,
		new subsequences are generated without biological fragment not
		desired by the user. Pozzi et al (2020)
