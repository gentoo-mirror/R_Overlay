		Gaussian Process Regression for Mortality Rates // A Bayesian
		statistical model for estimating child (under-five age group)
		and adult (15-60 age group) mortality.  The main challenge is
		how to combine and integrate these different time series and
		how to produce unified estimates of mortality rates during a
		specified time span. GPR is a Bayesian statistical model for
		estimating child and adult mortality rates which its data
		likelihood is mortality rates from different data sources such
		as: Death Registration System, Censuses or surveys. There are
		also various hyper-parameters for completeness of DRS, mean,
		covariance functions and variances as priors. This function
		produces estimations and uncertainty (95% or any desirable
		percentiles) based on sampling and non-sampling errors due to
		variation in data sources. The GP model utilizes Bayesian
		inference to update predicted mortality rates as a posterior in
		Bayes rule by combining data and a prior probability
		distribution over parameters in mean, covariance function, and
		the regression model. This package uses Markov Chain Monte
		Carlo (MCMC) to sample from posterior probability distribution
		by 'rstan' package in R. Details are given in Wang H, Dwyer-
		Lindgren L, Lofgren KT, et al. (2012)
