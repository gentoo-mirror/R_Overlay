		Estimation of the Extremal Index // Performs frequentist
		inference for the extremal index of a stationary time series.
		Two types of methodology are used.  One type is based on a
		model that relates the distribution of block maxima to the
		marginal distribution of series and leads to the semiparametric
		maxima estimators described in Northrop (2015)
		doi:10.1007/s10687-015-0221-5 and Berghaus and Bucher (2018)
		doi:10.1214/17-AOS1621.  Sliding block maxima are used to
		increase precision of estimation. A graphical block size
		diagnostic is provided.  The other type of methodology uses a
		model for the distribution of threshold inter-exceedance times
		(Ferro and Segers (2003) doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00401). Three
		versions of this type of approach are provided: the iterated
		weight least squares approach of Suveges (2007)
		doi:10.1007/s10687-007-0034-2, the K-gaps model of Suveges and
		Davison (2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292 and a similar approach of
		Holesovsky and Fusek (2020) doi:10.1007/s10687-020-00374-3 that
		we refer to as D-gaps. For the K-gaps and D-gaps models this
		package allows missing values in the data, can accommodate
		independent subsets of data, such as monthly or seasonal time
		series from different years, and can incorporate information
		from right-censored inter-exceedance times. Graphical
		diagnostics for the threshold level and the respective tuning
		parameters K and D are provided.
