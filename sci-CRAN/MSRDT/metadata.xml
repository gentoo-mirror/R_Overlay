		Multi-State Reliability Demonstration Tests (MSRDT) // This is a
		implementation of design methods for multi-state reliability
		demonstration tests (MSRDT) with failure count data, which is
		associated with the work from the published paper "Multi-state
		Reliability Demonstration Tests" by Suiyao Chen et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1080/08982112.2017.1314493. It implements two types of
		MSRDT, multiple periods (MP) and multiple failure modes (MFM).
		For MP, two different scenarios with criteria on cumulative
		periods (Cum) or separate periods (Sep) are implemented
		respectively. It also provides the implementation of
		conventional design method, namely binomial tests for failure
		count data.
