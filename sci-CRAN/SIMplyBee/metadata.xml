		'AlphaSimR' Extension for Simulating Honeybee Populations and
		Breeding Programmes // An extension of the 'AlphaSimR' package
		(https://cran.r-project.org/package=AlphaSimR) for stochastic
		simulations of honeybee populations and breeding programmes.
		'SIMplyBee' enables simulation of individual bees that form a
		colony, which includes a queen, fathers (drones the queen mated
		with), virgin queens, workers, and drones. Multiple colony can
		be merged into a population of colonies, such as an apiary or a
		whole country of colonies. Functions enable operations on
		castes, colony, or colonies, to ease 'R' scripting of whole
		populations. All 'AlphaSimR' functionality with respect to
		genomes and genetic and phenotype values is available and
		further extended for honeybees, including haplo-diploidy,
		complementary sex determiner locus, colony events (swarming,
		supersedure, etc.), and colony phenotype values.
