		Path Algorithm for Generalized Lasso Problems // Provides fast
		algorithms for computing the solution path for generalized
		lasso problems. Important use cases are the fused lasso over an
		arbitrary graph, and trend fitting of any given polynomial
		order. Specialized implementations for the latter two problems
		are given to improve stability and speed.
