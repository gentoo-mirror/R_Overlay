		Joint and Individual Regression // Implements the JICO algorithm
		[Wang, P., Wang, H., Li, Q., Shen, D.,  Liu, Y. (2022).
		arXiv:2209.12388], which solves the multi-group regression
		problem. The algorithm decomposes the responses from multiple
		groups into shared and group-specific components, which are
		driven by low-rank approximations of joint and individual
		structures from the covariates respectively. It provides the
		implementation of the algorithm so solve the iterative
		continuum regression problem with fixed rank selection, as well
		as the cross-validation function to perform hyperparameter
		tuning.
