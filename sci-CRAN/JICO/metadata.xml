		Joint and Individual Regression // An R package that implements
		the JICO algorithm [Wang, P., Wang, H., Li, Q., Shen, D.,  Liu,
		Y. (2024). Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics,
		33(3), 763-773]. It aims at solving the multi-group regression
		problem. The algorithm decomposes the responses from multiple
		groups into shared and group-specific components, which are
		driven by low-rank approximations of joint and individual
		structures from the covariates respectively.
