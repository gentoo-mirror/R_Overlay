		Variational Bayesian Estimation for Diagnostic Classification
		Models // Enables computationally efficient parameters-
		estimation by variational Bayesian methods for various
		diagnostic classification models (DCMs). DCMs are a class of
		discrete latent variable models for classifying respondents
		into latent classes that typically represent distinct
		combinations of skills they possess. Recently, to meet the
		growing need of large-scale diagnostic measurement in the field
		of educational, psychological, and psychiatric measurements,
		variational Bayesian inference has been developed as a
		computationally efficient alternative to the Markov chain Monte
		Carlo methods, e.g., Yamaguchi and Okada (2020a)

		doi:10.1007/s41237-020-00104-w, Oka and Okada (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s11336-022-09884-4, and Yamaguchi and Martinez
		(2023) doi:10.1111/bmsp.12308. To facilitate their
		applications, 'variationalDCM' is developed to provide a
		collection of recently-proposed variational Bayesian estimation
		methods for various DCMs.
