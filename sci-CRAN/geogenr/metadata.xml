		Geomultistar Generator from American Community Survey (ACS)
		Geodatabases // The American Community Survey (ACS)
		https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs offers geodatabases
		with geographic information and associated data of interest to
		researchers in the area. The goal of this package is to
		generate geomultistar objects from those geodatabases
		automatically, once the focus of attention is selected.
		Multidimensional queries with geographic information can be
		easily defined on these objects.
