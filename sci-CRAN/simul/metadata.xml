		Fast Simultaneous Confidence Bands Based on the Efficient
		Influence Function and Multiplier Bootstrap // Compute critical
		values for constructing uniform (simultaneous) confidence
		bands. The critical value is calculated using a multiplier
		bootstrap of the empirical efficient influence function as
		described by Kennedy (2019) doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1422737.
		The multiplier bootstrap does not require resampling of the
		data but only simulation of the multipliers and is thus
		computationally efficient.
