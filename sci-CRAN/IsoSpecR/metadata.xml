		The IsoSpec Algorithm // IsoSpec is a fine structure calculator
		used for obtaining the most probable masses of a chemical
		compound given the frequencies of the composing isotopes and
		their masses. It finds the smallest set of isotopologues with a
		given probability. The probability is assumed to be that of the
		product of multinomial distributions, each corresponding to one
		particular element and parametrized by the frequencies of
		finding these elements in nature. These numbers are supplied by
		IUPAC - the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.

		the description of the algorithms used.
