		Download and Measure Global Trends Through Google Search Volumes
		// Google offers public access to global search volumes from
		its search engine through the Google Trends portal. The package
		downloads these search volumes provided by Google Trends and
		uses them to measure and analyze the distribution of search
		scores across countries or within countries. The package allows
		researchers and analysts to use these search scores to
		investigate global trends based on patterns within these
		scores. This offers insights such as degree of
		internationalization of firms and organizations or
		dissemination of political, social, or technological trends
		across the globe or within single countries. An outline of the
		package's methodological foundations and potential applications
		is available as a working paper:
