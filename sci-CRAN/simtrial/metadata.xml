		Clinical Trial Simulation // Provides some basic routines for
		simulating a clinical trial. The primary intent is to provide
		some tools to generate trial simulations for trials with time
		to event outcomes. Piecewise exponential failure rates and
		piecewise constant enrollment rates are the underlying
		mechanism used to simulate a broad range of scenarios such as
		those presented in Lin et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1080/19466315.2019.1697738. However, the basic
		generation of data is done using pipes to allow maximum
		flexibility for users to meet different needs.
