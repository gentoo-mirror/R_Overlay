		Model-Based Clustering for Multivariate Partial Ranking Data //
		Implementation of a model-based clustering algorithm for
		ranking data (C. Biernacki, J. Jacques (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.08.008). Multivariate rankings as well
		as partial rankings are taken into account. This algorithm is
		based on an extension of the Insertion Sorting Rank (ISR) model
		for ranking data, which is a meaningful and effective model
		parametrized by a position parameter (the modal ranking, quoted
		by mu) and a dispersion parameter (quoted by pi). The
		heterogeneity of the rank population is modelled by a mixture
		of ISR, whereas conditional independence assumption is
		considered for multivariate rankings.
