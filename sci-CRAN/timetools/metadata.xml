		Seasonal/Sequential (Instants/Durations, Even or not) Time Series
		// Objects to manipulate sequential and seasonal time series.
		Sequential time series based on time instants and time duration
		are handled. Both can be regularly or unevenly spaced
		(overlapping duration are allowed). Only POSIX* format are used
		for dates and times. The following classes are provided :
		'POSIXcti', 'POSIXctp', 'TimeIntervalDataFrame',
		'TimeInstantDataFrame', 'SubtimeDataFrame' ; methods to switch
		from a class to another and to modify the time support of
		series (hourly time series to daily time series for instance)
		are also defined. Tools provided can be used for instance to
		handle environmental monitoring data (not always produced on a
		regular time base).
