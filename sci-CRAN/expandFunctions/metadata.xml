		Feature Matrix Builder // Generates feature matrix outputs from R
		object inputs using a variety of expansion functions.  The
		generated feature matrices have applications as inputs for a
		variety of machine learning algorithms. The expansion functions
		are based on coercing the input to a matrix, treating the
		columns as features and converting individual columns or
		combinations into blocks of columns. Currently these include
		expansion of columns by efficient sparse embedding by vectors
		of lags, quadratic expansion into squares and unique products,
		powers by vectors of degree, vectors of orthogonal polynomials
		functions, and block random affine projection transformations
		(RAPTs). The transformations are magrittr- and cbind-friendly,
		and can be used in a building block fashion.  For instance,
		taking the cos() of the output of the RAPT transformation
		generates a stationary kernel expansion via Bochner's theorem,
		and this expansion can then be cbind-ed with other features.
		Additionally, there are utilities for replacing features,
		removing rows with NAs, creating matrix samples of a given
		distribution, a simple wrapper for LASSO with CV, a Freeman-
		Tukey transform, generalizations of the outer function, matrix
		size-preserving discrete difference by row, plotting, etc.
