		Homogeneity and Sparsity Detection Incorporating Prior Constraint
		Information // We explore sparsity and homogeneity of
		regression coefficients incorporating prior constraint
		information. A general pairwise fusion approach is proposed to
		deal with the sparsity and homogeneity detection when combining
		prior convex constraints. We develop an modified alternating
		direction method of multipliers algorithm (ADMM) to obtain the
		estimators.
