		Supervised Cluster Analysis // Clusters features under the
		assumption that each cluster has a random effect and there is
		an outcome variable that is related to the random effects by a
		linear regression. In this way the cluster analysis is
		``supervised'' by the outcome variable. An alternate
		specification is that features in each cluster have the same
		compound symmetric normal distribution, and the conditional
		distribution of the outcome given the features has the same
		coefficient for each feature in a cluster.
