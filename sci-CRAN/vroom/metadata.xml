		Read and Write Rectangular Text Data Quickly // The goal of
		'vroom' is to read and write data (like 'csv', 'tsv' and 'fwf')
		quickly. When reading it uses a quick initial indexing step,
		then reads the values lazily , so only the data you actually
		use needs to be read.  The writer formats the data in parallel
		and writes to disk asynchronously from formatting.
