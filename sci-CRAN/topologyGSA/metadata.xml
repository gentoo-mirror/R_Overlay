		Gene Set Analysis Exploiting Pathway Topology // Using Gaussian
		graphical models we propose a novel approach to perform pathway
		analysis using gene expression. Given the structure of a graph
		(a pathway) we introduce two statistical tests to compare the
		mean and the concentration matrices between two groups.
		Specifically, these tests can be performed on the graph and on
		its connected components (cliques).
