		Group Technical Effects // Implementation of the GTE (Group
		Technical Effects) model for single-cell data. GTE is a
		quantitative metric to assess batch effects for individual
		genes in single-cell data. For a single-cell dataset, the user
		can calculate the GTE value for individual features (such as
		genes), and then identify the highly batch-sensitive features.
		Removing these highly batch-sensitive features results in
		datasets with low batch effects.
