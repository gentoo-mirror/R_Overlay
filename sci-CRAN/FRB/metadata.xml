		Fast and Robust Bootstrap // Perform robust inference based on
		applying Fast and Robust Bootstrap on robust estimators (Van
		Aelst and Willems (2013) doi:10.18637/jss.v053.i03). This
		method constitutes an alternative to ordinary bootstrap or
		asymptotic inference. procedures when using robust estimators
		such as S-, MM- or GS-estimators. The available methods are
		multivariate regression, principal component analysis and one-
		sample and two-sample Hotelling tests. It provides both the
		robust point estimates and uncertainty measures based on the
		fast and robust bootstrap.
