		Stratified-Petersen Analysis System // The Stratified-Petersen
		Analysis System (SPAS) is designed to estimate abundance in
		two-sample capture-recapture experiments where the capture and
		recaptures are stratified. This is a generalization of the
		simple Lincoln-Petersen estimator. Strata may be defined in
		time or in space or both, and the s strata in which marking
		takes place may differ from the t strata in which recoveries
		take place. When s=t, SPAS reduces to the method described by
		Darroch (1961) doi:10.2307/2332748. When st, SPAS implements
		the methods described in Plante, Rivest, and Tremblay (1988)
		doi:10.2307/2533994. Schwarz and Taylor (1998)
		doi:10.1139/f97-238 describe the use of SPAS in estimating
		return of salmon stratified by time and geography. A related
		package, BTSPAS, deals with temporal stratification where a
		spline is used to model the distribution of the population over
		time as it passes the second capture location. This is the
		R-version of the (now obsolete) standalone Windows program of
		the same name.
