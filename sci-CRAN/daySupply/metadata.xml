		Calculating Days' Supply and Daily Dose of Prescriptions //
		Allows clinicians and researchers to compute daily dose (and
		subsequently days' supply) for prescription refills using the
		following methods: Fixed window, fixed tablet, defined daily
		dose (DDD), and Random Effects Warfarin Days' Supply (REWarDS).
		Daily dose is the computed dose that the patient takes every
		day. For medications with fixed dosing (e.g. direct oral
		anticoagulants) this is known and does not need to be
		estimated. For medications with varying dose such as warfarin,
		however, the daily dose should be assumed or estimated to allow
		measurement of drug exposure. Days supply is the number of days
		that patients supply of medication will last after each
		prescription fill. Estimating days supply is necessary to
		calculate drug exposure. The package computes days supply and
		daily dose at both the prescription and patient levels. Results
		at the prescription level are denoted with -Rx- and those at
		patient level are denoted with -Pt-.
