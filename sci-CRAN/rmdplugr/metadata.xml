		Plugins for R Markdown Formats // Formats for R Markdown that
		undo modifications by 'pandoc' and 'rmarkdown' to original
		'latex' templates, such as smaller margins, paragraph spacing,
		and compact titles. In addition, enhancements such as author
		blocks with affiliations and headers and footers are
		introduced. All of this functionality is built around plugins
		that modify the default 'pandoc' template without relying on
		custom templates.
