		Bayesian Analysis of Small Area Estimation // This package
		provides a variety of functions to deal with several specific
		small area area- level models in Bayesian context. Models
		provided range from the basic Fay-Herriot model to its
		improvement such as You-Chapman models, unmatched models,
		spatial models and so on. Different types of priors for
		specific parameters could be chosen to obtain MCMC posterior
		draws. The main sampling function is written in C with GSL lab
		so as to facilitate the computation. Model internal checking
		and model comparison criteria are also involved.
