		Bayesian Analysis of Small Area Estimation // Provides a variety
		of methods from Rao (2003, ISBN:0-471-41374-7) and some other
		research articles to deal with several specific small area
		area- level models in Bayesian framework. Models provided range
		from the basic Fay-Herriot model to its improvement such as
		You-Chapman models, unmatched models, spatial models and so on.
		Different types of priors for specific parameters could be
		chosen to obtain MCMC posterior draws. The main sampling
		function is written in C with GSL lab so as to facilitate the
		computation. Model internal checking and model comparison
		criteria are also involved.
