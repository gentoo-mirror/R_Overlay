		Multidimensional Scaling of Asymmetric Data // Multidimensional
		scaling models and methods for the visualization for asymmetric
		data doi:10.1111/j.2044-8317.1996.tb01078.x. An asymmetric
		matrix has the same number of rows and columns, and these rows
		and columns refer to the same set of objects. At least some
		elements in the upper-triangle are different from the
		corresponding elements in the lower triangle. An example is a
		student migration table, where the rows correspond to the
		countries of origin of the students and the columns to the
		destination countries. This package provides the slide-vector
		model doi:10.1007/BF02294474, a scaling model with unique
		dimensions and the asymscal model for asymmetric
		multidimensional scaling. Furthermore, a heat map for skew-
		symmetric data, and the decomposition of asymmetry are provided
		for the analysis of asymmetric tables.
