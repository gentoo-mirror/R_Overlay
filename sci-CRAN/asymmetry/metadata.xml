		Multidimensional Scaling of Asymmetric Data // Multidimensional
		scaling models and methods for the visualization for asymmetric
		data. A matrix is asymmetric if the number of rows equals the
		number of columns, and these rows and columns refer to the same
		set of objects. An example is a  student migration table, where
		the rows correspond to the countries of origin of the students
		and the columns to the destination countries. This package
		provides the slide-vector model, a scaling model with unique
		dimensions and the asymscal model for asymmetric
		multidimensional scaling. Furthermore, a heat map for skew-
		symmetric data, and the decomposition of asymmetry are provided
		for the analysis of asymmetric tables.
