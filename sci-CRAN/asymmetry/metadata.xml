		Multidimensional Scaling of Asymmetric Proximities //
		Multidimensional scaling models and methods for the
		visualization and analysis of asymmetric proximity data. An
		asymmetric data matrix has the same number of rows and columns,
		and these rows and columns refer to the same set of objects. At
		least some elements in the upper-triangle are different from
		the corresponding elements in the lower triangle. An example of
		an asymmetric matrix is a  student migration table, where the
		rows correspond to the countries of origin of the students and
		the columns to the destination countries. This package provides
		algorithms for three multidimensional scaling models, the
		slide-vector model, a scaling model with unique dimensions and
		the asymscal model.Furthermore, some other procedures, such as
		a heat map for skew-symmetric data, and the decomposition of
		asymmetry are also provided for the exploratory analysis of
		asymmetric tables.
