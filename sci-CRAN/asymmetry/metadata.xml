		Multidimensional Scaling of Asymmetric Proximities //
		Multidimensional scaling models and methods for the
		visualization and analysis of asymmetric proximity data
		doi:10.1111/j.2044-8317.1996.tb01078.x. An asymmetric data
		matrix has the same number of rows and columns, and these rows
		and columns refer to the same set of objects. At least some
		elements in the upper-triangle are different from the
		corresponding elements in the lower triangle. An example of an
		asymmetric matrix is a  student migration table, where the rows
		correspond to the countries of origin of the students and the
		columns to the destination countries. This package provides
		algorithms for three multidimensional scaling models. These are
		the slide-vector model doi:10.1007/BF02294474, a scaling model
		with unique dimensions and the asymscal model for asymmetric
		multidimensional scaling. Furthermore, a heat map for skew-
		symmetric data, and the decomposition of asymmetry are provided
		for the exploratory analysis of asymmetric tables.
