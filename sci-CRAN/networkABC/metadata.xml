		Network Reverse Engineering with Approximate Bayesian Computation
		// We developed an inference tool based on approximate Bayesian
		computation to decipher network data and assess the strength of
		the inferred links between network's actors. It is a new multi-
		level approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach. At the
		first level, the method captures the global properties of the
		network, such as scale-freeness and clustering coefficients,
		whereas the second level is targeted to capture local
		properties, including the probability of each couple of genes
		being linked. Up to now, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
		algorithms have been scarcely used in that setting and, due to
		the computational overhead, their application was limited to a
		small number of genes. On the contrary, our algorithm was made
		to cope with that issue and has low computational cost. It can
		be used, for instance, for elucidating gene regulatory network,
		which is an important step towards understanding the normal
		cell physiology and complex pathological phenotype. Reverse-
		engineering consists in using gene expressions over time or
		over different experimental conditions to discover the
		structure of the gene network in a targeted cellular process.
		The fact that gene expression data are usually noisy, highly
		correlated, and have high dimensionality explains the need for
		specific statistical methods to reverse engineer the underlying
		network.
