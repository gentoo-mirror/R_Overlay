		Non-Parametric Cluster Significance Testing with Reference to a
		Unimodal Null Distribution // Assess the significance of
		identified clusters and estimates the true number of clusters
		by comparing the explained variation due to the clustering from
		the original data to that produced by clustering a unimodal
		reference distribution which preserves the covariance structure
		in the data. The reference distribution is generated using
		kernel density estimation and a Gaussian copula framework. A
		dimension reduction strategy and sparse covariance estimation
		optimize this method for the high-dimensional, low-sample size
		setting. This method is described in Helgeson, Vock, and Bair
		(2021) doi:10.1111/biom.13376.
