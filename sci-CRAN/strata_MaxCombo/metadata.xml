		Stratified Max-Combo Test // Non-proportional hazard (NPH) is
		commonly observed in immuno-oncology studies, where the
		survival curves of the treatment and control groups show
		delayed separation. To properly account for NPH, several
		statistical methods have been developed. One such method is
		Max-Combo test, which is a straightforward and flexible
		hypothesis testing method that can simultaneously test for
		constant, early, middle, and late treatment effects. However,
		the majority of the Max-Combo test performed in clinical
		studies are unstratified, ignoring the important prognostic
		stratification factors. To fill this gap, we have developed an
		R package for stratified Max-Combo testing that accounts for
		stratified baseline factors. Our package explores various
		methods for calculating combined test statistics, estimating
		joint distributions, and determining the p-values.
