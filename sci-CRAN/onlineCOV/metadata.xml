		Online Change Point Detection in High-Dimensional Covariance
		Structure // Implement a new stopping rule to detect anomaly in
		the covariance structure of high-dimensional online data. The
		detection procedure can be applied to Gaussian or non-Gaussian
		data with a large number of components. Moreover, it allows
		both spatial and temporal dependence in data. The dependence
		can be estimated by a data-driven procedure. The level of
		threshold in the stopping rule can be determined at a pre-
		selected average run length. More detail can be seen in Li, L.
		and Li, J. (2020) "Online Change-Point Detection in High-
		Dimensional Covariance Structure with Application to Dynamic
		Networks." arXiv:1911.07762.
