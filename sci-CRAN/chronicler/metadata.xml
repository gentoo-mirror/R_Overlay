		Add Logging to Functions // Decorate functions to make them
		return enhanced output. The enhanced output consists in an
		object of type 'chronicle' containing the result of the
		function applied to its arguments, as well as a log detailing
		when the function was run, what were its inputs, what were the
		errors (if the function failed to run) and other useful
		information. Tools to handle decorated functions are included,
		such as a forward pipe operator that makes chaining decorated
		functions possible.
