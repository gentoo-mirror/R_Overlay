		Root Expected Proportion Squared Difference for Detecting DIF //
		Root Expected Proportion Squared Difference (REPSD) is a
		nonparametric differential item functioning (DIF) method that
		(a) allows practitioners to explore for DIF related to small,
		fine-grained focal groups of examinees, and (b) compares the
		focal group directly to the composite group that will be used
		to develop the reported test score scale. Using your provided
		response matrix with a column that identifies focal group
		membership, this package provides the REPSD values, a simulated
		null distribution of possible REPSD values, and the simulated
		p-values identifying items possibly displaying DIF without
		requiring enormous sample sizes.
