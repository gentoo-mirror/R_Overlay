		Tabulate and Summarise Categorical Data // Functions for
		tabulating and summarising categorical variables. Most
		functions are designed to work with dataframes, and use the
		'tidyverse' idiom of taking the dataframe as the first argument
		so they work within pipelines. Equivalent functions that
		operate directly on vectors are also provided where it makes
		sense. This package aims to make exploratory data analysis
		involving categorical variables quicker, simpler and more
		robust.
