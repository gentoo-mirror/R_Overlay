		Estimation in DID with Multiple Groups and Periods // Estimate
		the effect of a treatment on an outcome in sharp Difference-in-
		Difference designs with multiple groups and periods. It
		computes the DIDM estimator introduced in Section 4 of "Two-Way
		Fixed Effects Estimators with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects"
		(Chaisemartin, D'Haultfoeuille (2020)
		doi:10.1257/aer.20181169), which generalizes the standard DID
		estimator with two groups, two periods and a binary treatment
		to situations with many groups,many periods and a potentially
		non-binary treatment. For each pair of consecutive time periods
		t-1 and t and for each value of the treatment d, the package
		computes a DID estimator comparing the outcome evolution among
		the switchers, the groups whose treatment changes from d to
		some other value between t-1 and t, to the same evolution among
		control groups whose treatment is equal to d both in t-1 and t.
		Then the DIDM estimator is equal to the average of those DIDs
		across all pairs of consecutive time periods and across all
		values of the treatment. Under a parallel trends assumption,
		DIDM is an unbiased and consistent estimator of the average
		treatment effect among switchers, at the time period when they
		switch. The package can also compute placebo estimators that
		can be used to test the parallel trends assumption. Finally, in
		staggered adoption designs where each group's treatment is
		weakly increasing over time, it can compute estimators of
		switchers' dynamic treatment effects, one time period or more
		after they have started receiving the treatment.
