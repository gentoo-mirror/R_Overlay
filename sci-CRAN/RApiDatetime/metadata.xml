		R API for 'Date' and 'Datetime' // Access to the C-level R date
		and 'datetime' code is provided for C-level API use by other
		packages via registration of native functions. Client packages
		simply include a single header 'RApiDatetime.h' provided by
		this package, and also 'import' it.  The R Core group is the
		original author of the code made available with slight
		modifications by this package.
