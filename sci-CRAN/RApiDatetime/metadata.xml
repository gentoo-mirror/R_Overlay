		R API Datetime // Access to the C-level R date and datetime code
		is provided for C-level API use by other packages via
		registration of native functions. Client packages simply
		include a single header 'RApiDatetime.h' provided by this
		package, and also 'import' it.  The R Core group is the
		original author of the code made available with slight
		modifications by this package.
