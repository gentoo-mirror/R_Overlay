		Bounding Treatment Effects by Limited Information Pooling //
		Estimation and inference methods for bounding average treatment
		effects (on the treated) that are valid under an
		unconfoundedness assumption. The bounds are designed to be
		robust in challenging situations, for example, when the
		conditioning variables take on a large number of different
		values in the observed sample, or when the overlap condition is
		violated. This robustness is achieved by only using limited
		"pooling" of information across observations. For more details,
		see the paper by Lee and Weidner (2021), "Bounding Treatment
		Effects by Pooling Limited Information across Observations,"
		arXiv:2111.05243.
