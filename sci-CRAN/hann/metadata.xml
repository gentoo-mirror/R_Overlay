		Hopfield Artificial Neural Networks // Builds and optimizes
		Hopfield artificial neural networks (Hopfield, 1982,
		doi:10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554). One-layer and three-layer models
		are implemented. The energy of the Hopfield network is
		minimized with formula from Krotov and Hopfield (2016,
		doi:10.48550/ARXIV.1606.01164). Optimization (supervised
		learning) is done through a gradient-based method.
		Classification is done with S3 methods predict().
		Parallelization with 'OpenMP' is used if available during
		compilation.
