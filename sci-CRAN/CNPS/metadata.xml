		Nonparametric Statistics // We unify various nonparametric
		hypothesis testing problems in a framework of permutation
		testing, enabling hypothesis testing on multi-sample,
		multidimensional data and contingency tables. Most of the
		functions available in the R environment to implement
		permutation tests are single functions constructed for specific
		test problems; to facilitate the use of the package, the
		package encapsulates similar tests in a categorized manner,
		greatly improving ease of use. We will all provide functions
		for self-selected permutation scoring methods and self-selected
		p-value calculation methods (asymptotic, exact, and sampling).
		For two-sample tests, we will provide mean tests and estimate
		drift sizes; we will provide tests on variance; we will provide
		paired-sample tests; we will provide correlation coefficient
		tests under three measures. For multi-sample problems, we will
		provide both ordinary and ordered alternative test problems.
		For multidimensional data, we will implement multivariate means
		(including ordered alternatives) and multivariate pairwise
		tests based on four statistics; the components with significant
		differences are also calculated. For contingency tables, we
		will perform permutation chi-square test or ordered
		alternative.
