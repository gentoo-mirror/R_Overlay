		Small Area Estimation for Key Health and Demographic Indicators
		from Household Surveys // Enables small area estimation (SAE)
		of health and demographic indicators in low- and middle-income
		countries (LMICs). It powers an R 'shiny' application for
		generating subnational estimates and prevalence maps of 150+
		binary indicators from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). It
		builds on the SAE analysis workflow from the 'surveyPrev'
		package. For documentation, visit
		https://sae4health.stat.uw.edu/. Methodological details can be
		found at Wu et al. (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.01467.
