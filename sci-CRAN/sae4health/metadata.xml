		Small Area Estimation for Key Health and Demographic Indicators
		from Household Surveys // Enables small area estimation (SAE)
		of health and demographic indicators in low- and middle-income
		countries (LMICs). It powers an R 'shiny' application that
		helps public health analysts, policymakers, and researchers
		generate subnational estimates and prevalence maps for 150+
		binary indicators from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
		Basing its core SAE analysis workflow on the 'surveyPrev'
		package, the app ensures methodological rigor through guided
		model selection, automated fitting, and interactive
		visualization. For more details, visit
