		Determining Vitamin and Mineral Status of Populations // Vitamin
		and mineral deficiencies continue to be a significant public
		health problem. This is particularly critical in developing
		countries where deficiencies to vitamin A, iron, iodine, and
		other micronutrients lead to adverse health consequences.
		Cross-sectional surveys are helpful in answering questions
		related to the magnitude and distribution of deficiencies of
		selected vitamins and minerals. This package provides tools for
		calculating and determining select vitamin and mineral
		deficiencies based on World Health Organization (WHO)
		guidelines found at https://www.who.int/teams/nutrition-and-
		food-safety/databases/vitamin-and-mineral-nutrition-
		information-system.
