		Robust Tests for Equal Correlation // There are 6 novel robust
		tests for equal correlation. They are all based on logistic
		regressions. The score statistic U is proportion to difference
		of two correlations based on different types of correlation in
		6 methods. The ST1() is based on Pearson correlation. ST2()
		improved ST1() by using median absolute deviation. ST3()
		utilized type M correlation and ST4() used Spearman
		correlation.  ST5() and ST6() used two different ways to
		combine ST3() and ST4().  We highly recommend ST5() according
		to the article titled ''New Statistical Methods for
		Constructing Robust Differential Correlation Networks to
		characterize the interactions among microRNAs'' published in
		Scientific Reports.  Please see the reference: Yu et al. (2019)
