		Robust Tests for Equal Correlation // There are 6 novel robust
		tests for equal correlation. They are all based on logistic
		regressions. The difference between 6 methods is the difference
		of U which are proportion to different types of correlation.
		The ST1() is based on Pearson correlation. ST2() improved ST1()
		by using median absolute deviation. ST3() utilized type M
		correlation and ST4() used Spearman correlation. ST5() and
		ST6() used two different ways to combine ST3() and ST4().  We
		highly recommend ST5() according to the passage New Statistical
		Methods for Constructing Robust Differential Correlation
		Networks (expected to be public).
