		Simulation-Based Power Analysis for Factorial Designs //
		Functions to perform simulations of ANOVA designs of up to
		three factors. Calculates the observed power and average
		observed effect size for all main effects and interactions in
		the ANOVA, and all simple comparisons between conditions.
		Includes functions for analytic power calculations and
		additional helper functions that compute effect sizes for ANOVA
		designs, observed error rates in the simulations, and functions
		to plot power curves. Please see Lakens, D.,  Caldwell, A. R.
		(2019). "Simulation-Based Power-Analysis for Factorial ANOVA
		Designs". doi:10.31234/osf.io/baxsf.
