		Temporal Network Centrality (TNC) Measures // Node centrality
		measures for temporal networks. Available measures are temporal
		degree centrality, temporal closeness centrality and temporal
		betweenness centrality defined by Kim and Anderson (2012)
		doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.85.026107. Applying the REN algorithm by
		Hanke and Foraita (2017) doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1677-x when
		calculating the centrality measures keeps the computational
		running time linear in the number of graph snapshots. Further,
		all methods can run in parallel up to the number of nodes in
		the network.
