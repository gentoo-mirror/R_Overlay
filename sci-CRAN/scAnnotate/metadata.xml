		An Automated Cell Type Annotation Tool for Single-Cell RNA-
		Sequencing Data // An entirely data-driven cell type annotation
		tools, which requires training data to learn the classifier,
		but not biological knowledge to make subjective decisions. It
		consists of three steps: preprocessing training and test data,
		model fitting on training data, and cell classification on test
		data. See Xiangling Ji,Danielle Tsao, Kailun Bai, Min Tsao,
		Xuekui Zhang.(2022)doi:10.1101/2022.02.19.481159 for more
		details.
