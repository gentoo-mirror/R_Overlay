		A Point Pattern Simulator for Spatial Cellular Data // Single
		cell resolution data has been valuable in learning about tissue
		microenvironments and interactions between cells or spots. This
		package allows for the simulation of this level of data, be it
		single cell or spots, in both a univariate (single metric or
		cell type) and bivariate (2 or more metrics or cell types)
		ways. As more technologies come to marker, more methods will be
		developed to derive spatial metrics from the data which will
		require a way to benchmark methods against each other.
		Additionally, as the field currently stands, there is not a
		gold standard method to be compared against. We set out to
		develop an R package that will allow users to simulate point
		patterns that can be biologically informed from different
		tissue domains, holes, and varying degrees of
		clustering/colocalization. The data can be exported as spatial
		files and a summary file (like 'HALO').
