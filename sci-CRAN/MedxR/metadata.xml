		Access Drug Regulatory Data via FDA and Health Canada APIs //
		Provides functions to access drug regulatory data from public
		RESTful APIs including the 'FDA Open API' and the 'Health
		Canada Drug Product Database API', retrieving real-time or
		historical information on drug approvals, adverse events,
		recalls, and product details. Additionally, the package
		includes a curated collection of open datasets focused on
		drugs, pharmaceuticals, treatments, and clinical studies. These
		datasets cover diverse topics such as treatment dosages,
		pharmacological studies, placebo effects, drug reactions,
		misuses of pain relievers, and vaccine effectiveness. The
		package supports reproducible research and teaching in
		pharmacology, medicine, and healthcare by integrating reliable
		international APIs and structured datasets from public,
		academic, and government sources. For more information on the
		APIs, see: 'FDA API' https://open.fda.gov/apis/ and 'Health
