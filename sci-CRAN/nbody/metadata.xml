		Gravitational N-Body Simulation // Run simple direct
		gravitational N-body simulations. The package can access
		different external N-body simulators (e.g. GADGET-4 by Springel
		et al. (2021) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2010.03567), but also has a
		simple built-in simulator. This default simulator uses a
		variable block time step and lets the user choose between a
		range of integrators, including 4th and 6th order integrators
		for high-accuracy simulations. Basic top-hat smoothing is
		available as an option. The code also allows the definition of
		background particles that are fixed or in uniform motion, not
		subject to acceleration by other particles.
