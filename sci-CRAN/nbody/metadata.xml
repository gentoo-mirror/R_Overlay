		Gravitational N-Body Simulation // Tools to run simple direct
		gravitational N-body simulations. It can access different
		external N-body simulators, but also has a simple built-in
		default simulator. This default simulator uses a variable block
		time step and lets the user choose between a range of
		integrators, including 4th and 6th order integrators for high-
		accuracy simulations. Basic top-hat smoothing is available as
		an option. The code also allows the definition of background
		particles that are fixed or in uniform motion, not subject to
		acceleration by other particles.
