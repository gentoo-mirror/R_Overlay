		Geographic Networks // Provides classes and methods for handling
		networks or graphs whose nodes are geographical (i.e. locations
		in the globe). The functionality includes the creation of
		objects of class geonetwork as a graph with node coordinates,
		the computation of network measures, the support of spatial
		operations (projection to different Coordinate Reference
		Systems, handling of bounding boxes, etc.) and the plotting of
		the geonetwork object combined with supplementary cartography
		for spatial representation.
