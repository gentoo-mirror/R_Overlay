		A Tool for Calculating Stoichiometric Equilibrium Constants (Ks)
		for Seawater // A unified software package simultaneously
		implemented in 'Python', 'R', and 'Matlab' providing a uniform
		and internally-consistent way of calculating stoichiometric
		equilibrium constants in modern and palaeo seawater as a
		function of temperature, salinity, pressure and the
		concentration of magnesium, calcium, sulphate, and fluorine.
