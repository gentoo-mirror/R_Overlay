		Variable Selection for Model-Based Clustering of Continuous,
		Count, Categorical or Mixed-Type Data Set with Missing Values
		// Variable Selection for model-based clustering managed by the
		Latent Class Model. This model analyses mixed-type data (data
		with continuous and/ or count and/or categorical variables)
		with missing values (missing at random) by assuming
		independence between classes. The one-dimensional marginals of
		the components follow standard distributions for facilitating
		both the model interpretation and the model selection. The
		variable selection is led by an alternated optimization
		procedure for maximizing the Maximum Integrated Complete-data
		Likelihood criterion. The maximum likelihood inference is done
		by an EM algorithm for the selected model. This package also
		performs the imputation of missing values by taking the
		expectation of the missing values conditionally on the model,
		its parameters and on the observed variables.
