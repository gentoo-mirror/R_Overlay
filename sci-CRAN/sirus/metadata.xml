		Stable and Interpretable RUle Set // A classification algorithm
		based on random forests, which takes the form of a short list
		of rules. SIRUS combines the simplicity of decision trees with
		the predictivity of random forests for problems with low order
		interactions. The core aggregation principle of random forests
		is kept, but instead of aggregating predictions, SIRUS selects
		the most frequent nodes of the forest to form a stable rule
		ensemble model. The algorithm is fully described in the
		following article: Benard C., Biau G., da Veiga S., Scornet E.
		(2019) arXiv:1908.06852. This R package is a fork from the
		project ranger (https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger).
