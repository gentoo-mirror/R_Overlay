		Identification of Bull and Bear States of the Market //
		Implements two algorithms of detecting Bull and Bear markets in
		stock prices: the algorithm of Pagan and Sossounov (2002,
		doi:10.1002/jae.664) and the algorithm of Lunde and Timmermann
		(2004, doi:10.1198/073500104000000136). The package also
		contains functions for printing out the dating of the Bull and
		Bear states of the market, the descriptive statistics of the
		states, and functions for plotting the results. For the sake of
		convenience, the package includes the monthly and daily data on
		the prices (not adjusted for dividends) of the SP 500 stock
		market index.
