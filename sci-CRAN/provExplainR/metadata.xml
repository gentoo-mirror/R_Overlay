		Compare Provenance Collections to Explain Changed Script Outputs
		// Inspects provenance collected by the 'rdt' or 'rdtLite'
		packages, or other tools providing compatible PROV JSON output
		created by the execution of a script, and find differences
		between two provenance collections. Factors under examination
		included the hardware and software used to execute the script,
		versions of attached libraries, use of global variables,
		modified inputs and outputs, and changes in main and sourced
		scripts. Based on detected changes, 'provExplainR' can be used
		to study how these factors affect the behavior of the script
		and generate a promising diagnosis of the causes of different
		script results. More information about 'rdtLite' and associated
		tools is available at https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/
		and Barbara Lerner, Emery Boose, and Luis Perez (2018), Using
		Introspection to Collect Provenance in R, Informatics,
