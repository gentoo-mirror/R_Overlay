		Evaluate Arbitrary Negative Binomial Convolutions // Three
		distinct methods are implemented for evaluating the sums of
		arbitrary negative binomial distributions. These methods are:
		Furman's exact probability mass function (Furman (2007)
		doi:10.1016/j.spl.2006.06.007), saddlepoint approximation, and
		a method of moments approximation. Functions are provided to
		calculate the density function, the distribution function and
		the quantile function of the convolutions in question given
		said evaluation methods. Functions for generating random
		deviates from negative binomial convolutions and for directly
		calculating the mean, variance, skewness, and excess kurtosis
		of said convolutions are also provided.
