		Semi-Supervised Gaussian Mixture Model with a Missing-Data
		Mechanism // The algorithm of semi-supervised learning is based
		on finite Gaussian mixture models and includes a mechanism for
		handling missing data. It aims to fit a g-class Gaussian
		mixture model using maximum likelihood. The algorithm treats
		the labels of unclassified features as missing data, building
		on the framework introduced by Rubin (1976) doi:10.2307/2335739
		for missing data analysis. By taking into account the
		dependencies in the missing pattern, the algorithm provides
		more information for determining the optimal classifier, as
		specified by Bayes' rule.
