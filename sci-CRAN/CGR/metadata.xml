		Compound Growth Rate for Capturing the Growth Rate Over the
		Period // The compound growth rate indicates the percentage
		change of a specific variable over a defined period. It is
		calculated using non-linear models, particularly the
		exponential model. To estimate the compound growth rates, the
		growth model is first converted to semilog form and then
		analyzed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. This
		package has been developed using concept of Shankar et al.
