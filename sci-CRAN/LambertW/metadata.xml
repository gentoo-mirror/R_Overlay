		Probabilistic Models to Analyze and Gaussianize Heavy-Tailed,
		Skewed Data // Lambert W x F distributions are a generalized
		framework to analyze skewed, heavy-tailed data. It is based on
		an input/output system, where the output random variable (RV) Y
		is a non-linearly transformed version of an input RV X ~ F with
		similar properties as X, but slightly skewed (heavy-tailed).
		The transformed RV Y has a Lambert W x F distribution. This
		package contains functions to model and analyze skewed, heavy-
		tailed data the Lambert Way: simulate random samples, estimate
		parameters, compute quantiles, and plot/ print results nicely.
		Probably the most important function is 'Gaussianize', which
		works similarly to 'scale', but actually makes the data
		Gaussian. A do-it-yourself toolkit allows users to define their
		own Lambert W x 'MyFavoriteDistribution' and use it in their
		analysis right away.
