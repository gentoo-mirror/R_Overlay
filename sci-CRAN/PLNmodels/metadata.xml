		Poisson Lognormal Models // The Poisson-lognormal model and
		variants (Chiquet, Mariadassou and Robin, 2021
		doi:10.3389/fevo.2021.588292) can be used for a variety of
		multivariate problems when count data are at play, including
		principal component analysis for count data, discriminant
		analysis, model-based clustering and network inference.
		Implements variational algorithms to fit such models
		accompanied with a set of functions for visualization and
		diagnostic.
