		Quantity-Intensity Relationship of Soil Potassium // The
		quantity-intensity (Q/I) relationships, first introduced by
		Beckett (1964), can be employed to assess the K supplying
		capacity of different soils based on solid-solution exchange
		equilibria. Such relationships describe the changes in K+
		concentration in the soil solution (or the intensity factor) in
		relation to the corresponding changes in K+ at exchange sites
		of the soil (or the capacity or quantity factor). Activity
		ratio of K to Ca or Ca+Mg is generally used as the variable
		denoting the intensity, whereas, change in exchangeable K is
		used to denote the quantity factor.
