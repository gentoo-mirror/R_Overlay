		Multi-Objective Clustering Algorithm Guided by a-Priori
		Biological Knowledge // Implements the Multi-Objective
		Clustering Algorithm Guided by a-Priori Biological Knowledge
		(MOC-GaPBK) which was proposed by Parraga-Alava, J. et. al.
		(2018) doi:10.1186/s13040-018-0178-4. It was designed for
		clustering genes based on co-expression, biological coherence,
		compactness, and separation criteria. However, its flexible
		design allows it to be applied to cluster data of various types
		and domains. The algorithm optimizes object relationships based
		on two objective functions using cluster quality indexes,
		incorporating intensification and diversification strategies to
		enhance the search process.
