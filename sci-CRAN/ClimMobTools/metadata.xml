		API Client for the 'ClimMob' Platform // API client for
		'ClimMob', an open source software for experimental
		crowdsourcing citizen science under the 'tricot' approach
		https://climmob.net/. Developed by van Etten et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1017/S0014479716000739, it turns the research paradigm
		on its head; instead of a few researchers designing complicated
		trials to compare several technologies in search of the best
		solutions for the target environment, it enables many
		participants to carry out reasonably simple experiments that
		taken together can offer even more information. 'ClimMobTools'
		enables project managers to deep explore and analyse their
		'ClimMob' data in R.
