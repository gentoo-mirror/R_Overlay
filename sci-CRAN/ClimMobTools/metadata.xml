		Tools for Crowdsourcing Citizen Science in Agriculture // Toolkit
		for the 'ClimMob' platform in R. 'ClimMob' is an open source
		software for crowdsourcing citizen science in agriculture
		https://climmob.net/climmob3/. Developed by van Etten et al.
		(2019) doi:10.1017/S0014479716000739, it turns the research
		paradigm on its head; instead of a few researchers designing
		complicated trials to compare several technologies in search of
		the best solutions, it enables many farmers to carry out
		reasonably simple experiments that taken together can offer
		even more information. 'ClimMobTools' enables project managers
		to deep explore and analyse their 'ClimMob' data in R.
