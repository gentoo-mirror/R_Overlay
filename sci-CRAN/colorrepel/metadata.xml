		Repel Visually Similar Colors for Colorblind Users in Various
		Plots // Iterate and repel visually similar colors away in
		various 'ggplot2' plots. When many groups are plotted at the
		same time on multiple axes, for instance stacked bars or
		scatter plots, effectively ordering colors becomes difficult.
		This tool iterates through color combinations to find the best
		solution to maximize visual distinctness of nearby groups, so
		plots are more friendly toward colorblind users. This is
		achieved by two distance measurements, distance between groups
		within the plot, and CIELAB color space distances between
		colors as described in Carter et al., (2018)
