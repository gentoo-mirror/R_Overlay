		Visualizing Panel Data with Dichotomous Treatments // Visualizes
		panel data with dichotomous treatments. 'panelView' has two
		main functionalities: (1) it visualizes the treatment and
		missing-value statuses of each observation in a panel/time-
		series-cross-sectional (TSCS) dataset; and (2) it plots the
		outcome variable (either continuous or discrete) in a time-
		series fashion.
