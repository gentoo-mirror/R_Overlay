		'Utilities of Institute of Data Analyses and Process Design
		(www.zhaw.ch/idp)' // Different high-level graphics functions
		for displaying large datasets, displaying circular data in a
		very flexible way, finding local maxima, brewing color ramps,
		drawing nice arrows, zooming 2D-plots, creating figures with
		differently colored margin and plot region.  In addition, the
		package contains auxiliary functions for data manipulation like
		omitting observations with irregular values or selecting data
		by logical vectors, which include NAs. Other functions are
		especially useful in spectroscopy and analyses of environmental
		data: robust baseline fitting, finding peaks in spectra,
		converting humidity measures.
