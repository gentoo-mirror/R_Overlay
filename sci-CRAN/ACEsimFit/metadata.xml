		ACE Kin Pair Data Simulations and Model Fitting // A few
		functions aim to provide a statistic tool for three purposes.
		First, simulate kin pairs data based on the assumption that
		every trait is affected by genetic effects (A), common
		environmental effects (C) and unique environmental effects
		(E).Second, use kin pairs data to fit an ACE model and get
		model fit output.Third, calculate power of A estimate given a
		specific condition. For the mechanisms of power calculation, we
		suggest to check Visscher(2004)doi:10.1375/twin.7.5.505.
