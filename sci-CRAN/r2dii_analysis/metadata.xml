		Tools to Calculate Climate Targets for Financial Portfolios //
		These tools help you to assess if a financial portfolio aligns
		with climate goals. They summarize key metrics attributed to
		the portfolio (e.g. production, emission factors), and
		calculate targets based on climate scenarios. They implement in
		R the last step of the free software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement
		Capital Transition Assessment; https://2degrees-
		investing.org/). Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study
		how their capital allocation impacts the climate.
