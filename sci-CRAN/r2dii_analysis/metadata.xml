		Measure Climate Scenario Alignment of Corporate Loans // These
		tools help you to assess if a corporate lending portfolio
		aligns with climate goals. They summarize key climate
		indicators attributed to the portfolio (e.g. production,
		emission factors), and calculate alignment targets based on
		climate scenarios. They implement in R the last step of the
		free software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition
		Assessment; https://www.transitionmonitor.com/). Financial
		institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital allocation
		decisions align with climate change mitigation goals.
