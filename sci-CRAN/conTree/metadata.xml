		Contrast Trees and Boosting // Contrast trees represent a new
		approach for assessing the accuracy of many types of machine
		learning estimates that are not amenable to standard (cross)
		validation methods; see "Contrast trees and distribution
		boosting", Jerome H. Friedman (2020)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.1921562117. In situations where inaccuracies
		are detected, boosted contrast trees can often improve
		performance. Functions are provided to to build such trees in
		addition to a special case, distribution boosting, an
		assumption free method for estimating the full probability
		distribution of an outcome variable given any set of joint
		input predictor variable values.
