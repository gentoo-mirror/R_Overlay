		Lightweight Modern  Responsive Card Component for 'shiny' //
		Responsive and modern 'HTML' card essentials for 'shiny'
		applications and dashboards. This novel card component in
		'Bootstrap' provides a flexible and extensible content
		container with multiple variants and options for building
		robust 'R' based apps e.g for graph build or machine learning
		projects. The features rely on a combination of 'JQuery'
		https://jquery.com and 'CSS' styles to improve the card
		functionality.
