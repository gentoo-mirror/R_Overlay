		Efficient Least Squares for Total Causal Effects // Estimate a
		total causal effect from observational data under linearity and
		causal sufficiency. The observational data is supposed to be
		generated from a linear structural equation model (SEM) with
		independent and additive noise. The underlying causal DAG
		associated the SEM is required to be known up to a maximally
		oriented partially directed graph (MPDAG), which is a general
		class of graphs consisting of both directed and undirected
		edges, including CPDAGs (i.e., essential graphs) and DAGs. Such
		graphs are usually obtained with structure learning algorithms
		with added background knowledge. The program is able to
		estimate every identified effect, including single and multiple
		treatment variables. Moreover, the resulting estimate has the
		minimal asymptotic covariance (and hence shortest confidence
		intervals) among all estimators that are based on the sample
		covariance.
