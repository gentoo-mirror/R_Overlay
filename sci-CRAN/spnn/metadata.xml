		Scale Invariant Probabilistic Neural Networks // Scale invariant
		version of the original PNN proposed by Specht (1990)
		doi:10.1016/0893-6080(90)90049-q with the added functionality
		of allowing for smoothing along multiple dimensions while
		accounting for covariances within the data set. It is written
		in the R statistical programming language. Given a data set
		with categorical variables, we use this algorithm to estimate
		the probabilities of a new observation vector belonging to a
		specific category. This type of neural network provides the
		benefits of fast training time relative to backpropagation and
		statistical generalization with only a small set of known
		observations.
