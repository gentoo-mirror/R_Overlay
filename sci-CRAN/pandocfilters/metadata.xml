		Pandoc Filters for R // The document converter 'pandoc'
		https://pandoc.org/ is widely used in the R community. One
		feature of 'pandoc' is that it can produce and consume JSON-
		formatted abstract syntax trees (AST). This allows to transform
		a given source document into JSON-formatted AST, alter it by so
		called filters and pass the altered JSON-formatted AST back to
		'pandoc'. This package provides functions which allow to write
		such filters in native R code. Although this package is
		inspired by the Python package 'pandocfilters'
		https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/, it provides additional
		convenience functions which make it simple to use the
		'pandocfilters' package as a report generator. Since
		'pandocfilters' inherits most of it's functionality from
		'pandoc' it can create documents in many formats (for more
		information see https://pandoc.org/) but is also bound to the
		same limitations as 'pandoc'.
