		Deficit Index (DI) // A set of utilities for calculating the
		Deficit (frailty) Index (DI) in gerontological studies. The
		deficit index was first proposed by Arnold Mitnitski and
		Kenneth Rockwood and represents a proxy measure of aging and
		also can be served as a sensitive predictor of survival. For
		more information, see (i)"Accumulation of Deficits as a Proxy
		Measure of Aging" by Arnold B. Mitnitski et al. (2001), The
		Scientific World Journal 1, DOI:10.1100/tsw.2001.58; (ii)
		"Frailty, fitness and late-life mortality in relation to
		chronological and biological age" by Arnold B Mitnitski et al.
