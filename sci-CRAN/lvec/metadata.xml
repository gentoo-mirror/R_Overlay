		Out of Memory Vectors // Core functionality for working with
		vectors (numeric, integer, logical and character) that are too
		large to keep in memory. The vectors are kept (partially) on
		disk using memory mapping. This package contains the basic
		functionality for working with these memory mapped vectors
		(e.g. creating, indexing, ordering and sorting) and provides
		C++ headers which can be used by other packages to extend the
		functionality provided in this package.
