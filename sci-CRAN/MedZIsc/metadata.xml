		Statistical Framework for Co-Mediators of Zero-Inflated Single-
		Cell Data // A causal mediation framework for single-cell data
		that incorporates two key features ('MedZIsc', pronounced
		Magics): (1) zero-inflation using beta regression and (2)
		overdispersed expression counts using negative binomial
		regression. This approach also includes a screening step based
		on penalized and marginal models to handle high-dimensionality.
		Full methodological details are available in our recent
		preprint by Ahn S and Li Z (2025)
