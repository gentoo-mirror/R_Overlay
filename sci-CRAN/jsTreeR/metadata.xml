		A Wrapper of the JavaScript Library 'jsTree' // Creates
		interactive trees that can be included in 'Shiny' apps and R
		markdown documents. A tree allows to represent hierarchical
		data (e.g. the contents of a directory). Similar to the
		'shinyTree' package but offers more features and options, such
		as the grid extension, restricting the drag-and-drop behavior,
		and settings for the search functionality. It is possible to
		attach some data to the nodes of a tree and then to get these
		data in 'Shiny' when a node is selected. Also provides a
		'Shiny' gadget allowing to manipulate one or more folders.
