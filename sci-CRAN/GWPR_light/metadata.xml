		Geographically Weighted Panel Regression // Geographically
		weighted panel regression is grounded in a branch of spatial
		statistics. Using geographically weights, the geographically
		weighted panel regression is try to solve the residuals from
		panel regression clustering spatially. To investigate whether
		the residuals cluster spatially, the Moran's I test is also
		improved. Furthermore, three local statistic tests are
		contained to help the users select model. The major references
		are Fotheringham et al. (2003, ISBN:978-0-470-85525-6) and
		Beenstock and Felsenstein (2019, ISBN:978-3-030-03614-0).
