		Data Science Box of Pandora Miscellaneous // Tool collection for
		common and not so common data science use cases. This includes
		custom made algorithms for data management as well as value
		calculations that are hard to find elsewhere because of their
		specificity but would be a waste to get lost nonetheless.
		Currently available functionality: find sub-graphs in an edge
		list data.frame, find mode or modes in a vector of values,
		extract (a) specific regular expression group(s), generate ISO
		time stamps that play well with file names, or generate URL
		parameter lists by expanding value combinations.
