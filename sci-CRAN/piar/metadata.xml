		Price Index Aggregation // Most price indexes are made with a
		two-step procedure, where period-over-period elemental indexes
		are first calculated for a collection of elemental aggregates
		at each point in time, and then aggregated according to a price
		index aggregation structure. These indexes can then be chained
		together to form a time series that gives the evolution of
		prices with respect to a fixed base period. This package
		contains a collection of functions that revolve around this
		work flow, making it easy to build standard price indexes, and
		implement the methods described by Balk (2008,
		doi:10.1017/CBO9780511720758), von der Lippe (2007,
		doi:10.3726/978-3-653-01120-3), and the CPI manual (2020,
		doi:10.5089/9781484354841.069) for bilateral price indexes.
