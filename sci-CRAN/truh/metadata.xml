		Two-Sample Nonparametric Testing Under Heterogeneity //
		Implements the TRUH test statistic for two sample testing under
		heterogeneity. TRUH incorporates the underlying heterogeneity
		and imbalance in the samples, and provides a conservative test
		for the composite null hypothesis that the two samples arise
		from the same mixture distribution but may differ with respect
		to the mixing weights. See Trambak Banerjee, Bhaswar B.
