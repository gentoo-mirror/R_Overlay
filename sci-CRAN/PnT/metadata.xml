		Peak Finder // This program contains a function to find the peaks
		and troughs of a data set. It filters the set of peaks to
		remove noise based on the expected height and expected slope of
		a peak. Peaks that are too short (caused by random noise), or
		too shallow (part of the background data) are filtered out.
