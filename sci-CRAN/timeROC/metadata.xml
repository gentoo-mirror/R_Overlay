		Time-Dependent ROC Curve and AUC for Censored Survival Data //
		Estimation of time-dependent ROC curve and area under time
		dependent ROC curve (AUC) in the presence of censored data,
		with or without competing risks. Confidence intervals of AUCs
		and tests for comparing AUCs of two rival markers measured on
		the same subjects can be computed, using the iid-representation
		of the AUC estimator. Plot functions for time-dependent ROC
		curves and AUC curves are provided. Time-dependent Positive
		Predictive Values (PPV) and Negative Predictive Values (NPV)
		can also be computed. See Blanche et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1002/sim.5958 and references therein for the details of
		the methods implemented in the package.
