		Support for Compiling Examination Tasks using the 'exams' Package
		// The main aim is to further facilitate the creation of
		exercises based on the package 'exams' by Grn, B., and Zeileis,
		A. (2009) doi:10.18637/jss.v029.i10. Creating effective student
		exercises involves challenges such as creating appropriate data
		sets and ensuring access to intermediate values for accurate
		explanation of solutions. The functionality includes the
		generation of univariate and bivariate data including simple
		time series, functions for theoretical distributions and their
		approximation, statistical and mathematical calculations for
		tasks in basic statistics courses as well as general tasks such
		as string manipulation, LaTeX/HTML formatting and the editing
		of XML task files for 'Moodle'.
