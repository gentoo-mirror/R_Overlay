		Statistical Toolbox for Radiometric Geochronology // An R
		implementation of Ken Ludwig's popular Isoplot add-in to
		Microsoft Excel. Currently plots U-Pb data on Wetherill and
		Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagrams. Calculates concordia and
		discordia ages. Performs linear regression of measurements with
		correlated errors using the 'York' approach. Generates Kernel
		Density Estimates (KDEs) and Cumulative Age Distributions
		(CADs). Produces Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) configurations
		and Shepard plots of multi-sample detrital datasets using the
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance as a dissimilarity measure.
		Calculates 40Ar/39Ar ages, isochrons, and age spectra. Computes
		weighted means accounting for overdispersion. Calculates U-Th-
		He (single grain and central) ages, logratio plots and ternary
		diagrams. Processes fission track data using the external
		detector method and LA-ICP-MS, calculates central ages and
		plots fission track and other data on radial (a.k.a.
		'Galbraith' plots). Constructs Re-Os, Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr
		isochrons. Future versions will include functionality for Lu-Hf
		and U-series dating methods. A graphical user interface is
		provided as an RStudio Shiny app at http://isoplotr.london-
		geochron.com.
