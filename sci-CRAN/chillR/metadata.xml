		Statistical Methods for Phenology Analysis in Temperate Fruit
		Trees // The phenology of plants (i.e. the timing of their
		annual life phases) depends on climatic cues. For temperate
		trees and many other plants, spring phases, such as leaf
		emergence and flowering, have been found to result from the
		effects of both cool (chilling) conditions and heat. Fruit tree
		scientists (pomologists) have developed some metrics to
		quantify chilling and heat (e.g. see Luedeling (2012)
		doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2012.07.011). 'chillR' contains
		functions for processing temperature records into chilling
		(Chilling Hours, Utah Chill Units and Chill Portions) and heat
		units (Growing Degree Hours). Regarding chilling metrics, Chill
		Portions are often considered the most promising, but they are
		difficult to calculate. This package makes it easy. 'chillR'
		also contains procedures for conducting a PLS analysis relating
		phenological dates (e.g. bloom dates) to either mean
		temperatures or mean chill and heat accumulation rates, based
		on long-term weather and phenology records (Luedeling and
		Gassner (2012) doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.10.020). As of
		version 0.65, it also includes functions for generating weather
		scenarios with a weather generator, for conducting climate
		change analyses for temperature-based climatic metrics and for
		plotting results from such analyses. Since version 0.70,
		'chillR' contains a function for interpolating hourly
		temperature records.
