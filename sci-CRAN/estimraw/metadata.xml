		Estimation of Four-Fold Table Cell Frequencies (Raw Data) from
		Effect Size Measures // Estimation of four-fold table cell
		frequencies (raw data) from risk ratios (relative risks), risk
		differences and odds ratios. While raw data can be useful for
		doing meta-analysis, such data is often not provided by primary
		studies (with summary statistics being solely presented).
		Therefore, based on summary statistics (namely, risk ratios,
		risk differences and odds ratios), this package estimates the
		value of each cell in a 2x2 table according to the equations
		described in Di Pietrantonj C (2006) doi:10.1002/sim.2287.
