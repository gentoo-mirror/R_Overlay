		Incomplete Block Designs using Hadamard Matrix (HadIBDs) //
		Hadamard matrix based statistical designs are of immense
		importance as the resultant designs carry various desirable
		characterizing properties. Constructing Partially Balanced
		Incomplete Block Designs (PBIBds) using Kronecker product of
		incidence matrices of Balanced Incomplete Block (BIB) and
		Partially Balanced Incomplete Block (PBIB) designs is much
		evident from literature. Here, we have constructed Incomplete
		Block Designs (IBDs) based on Hadamard matrices and Kronecker
		product of Hadamard matrices.
