		Bayesian Spatial Blind Source Separation // Gibbs sampling for
		Bayesian spatial blind source separation (BSP-BSS). BSP-BSS is
		designed for spatially dependent signals in high dimensional
		and large-scale data, such as neuroimaging. The method assumes
		the expectation of the observed images as a linear mixture of
		multiple sparse and piece-wise smooth latent source signals,
		and constructs a Bayesian nonparametric prior by thresholding
		Gaussian processes. Details can be found in our paper: Wu, B.,
		Guo, Y.,  Kang, J. (2024). Bayesian spatial blind source
		separation via the thresholded gaussian process. Journal of the
		American Statistical Association, 119(545), 422-433.
