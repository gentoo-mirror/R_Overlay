		Bayesian Spatial Blind Source Separation // Gibbs sampling for
		Bayesian spatial blind source separation (BSP-BSS). BSP-BSS is
		designed for spatially dependent signals in high dimensional
		and large-scale data, such as neuroimaging. The method assumes
		the expectation of the observed images as a linear mixture of
		multiple sparse and piece-wise smooth latent source signals,
		and constructs a Bayesian nonparametric prior by thresholding
		Gaussian processes. Details can be found in our working paper:
		Ben et al. (2022+) "Bayesian Spatial Blind Source Separation
		via the Thresholded Gaussian Process".
