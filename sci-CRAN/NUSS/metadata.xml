		Mixed N-Grams and Unigram Sequence Segmentation // Segmentation
		of short text sequences - like hashtags - into the separated
		words sequence, done with the use of dictionary, which may be
		built on custom corpus of texts. Unigram dictionary is used to
		find most probable sequence, and n-grams approach is used to
		determine possible segmentation given the text corpus.
