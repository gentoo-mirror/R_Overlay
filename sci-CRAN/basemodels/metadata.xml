		Baseline Models for Classification and Regression // Providing
		equivalent functions for the dummy classifier and regressor
		used in 'Python' 'scikit-learn' library. Our goal is to allow R
		users to easily identify baseline performance for their
		classification and regression problems. Our baseline models use
		no predictors, and are useful in cases of class imbalance,
		multiclass classification, and when users want to quickly
		identify how much improvement their statistical and machine
		learning models are over several baseline models. We use a
		"better" default (proportional guessing) for the dummy
		classifier than the 'Python' implementation ("prior", which is
		the most frequent class in the training set). The functions in
		the package can be used on their own, or introduce methods
		named 'dummy_regressor' or 'dummy_classifier' that can be used
		within the caret package pipeline.
