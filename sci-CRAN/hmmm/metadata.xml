		Hierarchical Multinomial Marginal Models // Functions for
		specifying and fitting marginal models for contingency tables
		proposed by Bergsma and Rudas (2002) here called hierarchical
		multinomial marginal models (hmmm) and their extensions
		presented by Bartolucci et al. (2007); multinomial Poisson
		homogeneous (mph) models and homogeneous linear predictor (hlp)
		models for contingency tables proposed by Lang (2004) and
		(2005); hidden Markov models where the distribution of the
		observed variables is described by a marginal model. Inequality
		constraints on the parameters are allowed and can be tested.
