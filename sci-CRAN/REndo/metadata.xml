		Fitting Linear Models with Endogenous Regressors using Latent
		Instrumental Variables // Fits linear models with endogenous
		regressor using latent instrumental variable approaches. The
		methods included in the package are Lewbel's (1997)
		doi:10.2307/2171884 higher moments approach as well as Lewbel's
		(2012) doi:10.1080/07350015.2012.643126 heteroskedasticity
		approach, Park and Gupta's (2012)
		doi:10.1287/mksc.1120.0718joint estimation method that uses
		Gaussian copula and Kim and Frees's (2007)
		doi:10.1007/s11336-007-9008-1 multilevel generalized method of
		moment approach that deals with endogeneity in a multilevel
		setting. These are statistical techniques to address the
		endogeneity problem where no external instrumental variables
		are needed. This version: - includes an omitted variable test
		in the multilevel estimation. It is reported in the summary()
		function of the multilevelIV() function. - resolves the error
		"Error in listIDs[, 1] : incorrect number of dimensions" when
		using the multilevelIV() function. - a new simulated dataset is
		provided, dataMultilevelIV, on which to exemplify the
		multilevelIV() function.
