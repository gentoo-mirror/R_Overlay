		Fitting Linear Models with Endogenous Regressors using Latent
		Instrumental Variables // Fits linear models with endogenous
		regressor using latent instrumental variable approaches. The
		methods included in the package are Lewbel's (1997)
		doi:10.2307/2171884 higher moments approach as well as Lewbel's
		(2012) doi:10.1080/07350015.2012.643126 heteroskedasticity
		approach, Park and Gupta's (2012)
		doi:10.1287/mksc.1120.0718joint estimation method that uses
		Gaussian copula and Kim and Frees's (2007)
		doi:10.1007/s11336-007-9008-1 multilevel generalized method of
		moment approach that deals with endogeneity in a multilevel
		setting. These are statistical techniques to address the
		endogeneity problem where no external instrumental variables
		are needed. This version: - solves an error occurring when
		using the multilevelIV() function with two levels, random
		intercept. - returns the AIC and BIC for copulaCorrection()
		(method 1) and latentIV() methods. - residuals and fitted
		values can be saved by users for latentIV() and
		copulaCorrection() methods. - improves the summary methods for
		copulaCorrection() and multilevelIV() functions.
