		Create Geographic and Non-Geographic Map Tiles // Creates
		geographic map tiles from geospatial map files or non-
		geographic map tiles from simple image files. This package
		provides a tile generator function for creating map tile sets
		for use with packages such as 'leaflet'. In addition to
		generating map tiles based on a common raster layer source, it
		also handles the non-geographic edge case, producing map tiles
		from arbitrary images. These map tiles, which have a non-
		geographic, simple coordinate reference system (CRS), can also
		be used with 'leaflet' when applying the simple CRS option. Map
		tiles can be created from a input file with any of the
		following extensions: tif, grd and nc for spatial maps and png,
		jpg and bmp for basic images. This package requires 'Python'
		and the 'gdal' library for 'Python'. 'Windows' users are
		recommended to install 'OSGeo4W'
		(https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) as an easy way to obtain the
		required 'gdal' support for 'Python'.
