		Cross-Covariance Isolate Detect: a New Change-Point Method for
		Estimating Dynamic Functional Connectivity // Provides
		efficient implementation of the Cross-Covariance Isolate Detect
		(CCID) methodology for the estimation of the number and
		location of multiple change-points in the second-order (cross-
		covariance or network) structure of multivariate, possibly
		high-dimensional time series. The method is motivated by the
		detection of change points in functional connectivity networks
		for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
		electroencephalography (EEG), magentoencephalography (MEG) and
		electrocorticography (ECoG) data. The main routines in the
		package have been extensively tested on fMRI data. For details
		on the CCID methodology, please see Anastasiou et al (2020)
