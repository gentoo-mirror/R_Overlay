		Find Range of Cronbach Alpha with a Dataset Including Missing
		Data // Provides functions to calculate the minimum and maximum
		possible values of Cronbach's alpha when item-level missing
		data are present. Cronbach's alpha (Cronbach, 1951
		doi:10.1007/BF02310555) is one of the most widely used measures
		of internal consistency in the social, behavioral, and medical
		sciences (Bland  Altman, 1997 doi:10.1136/bmj.314.7080.572;
		Tavakol  Dennick, 2011 doi:10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd). However,
		conventional implementations assume complete data, and listwise
		deletion is often applied when missingness occurs, which can
		lead to biased or overly optimistic reliability estimates
		(Enders, 2003 doi:10.1037/1082-989X.8.3.322). This package
		implements computational strategies including enumeration,
		Monte Carlo sampling, and optimization algorithms (e.g.,
		Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, Sequential Least
		Squares Programming) to obtain sharp lower and upper bounds of
		Cronbach's alpha under arbitrary missing data patterns. The
		approach is motivated by Manski's partial identification
		framework and pessimistic bounding ideas from optimization
		literature.
