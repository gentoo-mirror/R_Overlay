		Bayesian Estimation of Incoherent Neutron Scattering Backgrounds
		// We implemented a Bayesian-statistics approach for
		subtraction of incoherent scattering from neutron total-
		scattering data. In this approach, the estimated background
		signal associated with incoherent scattering maximizes the
		posterior probability, which combines the likelihood of this
		signal in reciprocal and real spaces with the prior that favors
		smooth lines. The description of the corresponding approach
		could be found at Gagin and Levin (2014)
