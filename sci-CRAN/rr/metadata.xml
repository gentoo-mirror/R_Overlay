		Statistical Methods for the Randomized Response Technique //
		Enables researchers to conduct multivariate statistical
		analyses of survey data with randomized response technique
		items from several designs, including mirrored question, forced
		question, and unrelated question. This includes regression with
		the randomized response as the outcome and logistic regression
		with the randomized response item as a predictor. In addition,
		tools for conducting power analysis for designing randomized
		response items are included. The package implements methods
		described in Blair, Imai, and Zhou (2015) ''Design and Analysis
		of the Randomized Response Technique,'' Journal of the American
		Statistical Association
