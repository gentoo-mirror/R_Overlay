		Identifying Unique Multilocus Genotypes where Genotyping Error
		and Missing Data may be Present // Tools for the identification
		of unique of multilocus genotypes when both genotyping error
		and missing data may be present. The package is targeted at
		those working with large datasets and databases containing
		multiple samples of each individual, a situation that is common
		in conservation genetics, and particularly in non-invasive
		wildlife sampling applications. Functions explicitly
		incorporate missing data, and can tolerate allele mismatches
		created by genotyping error. If you use this tool, please cite
		the package using the journal article in Molecular Ecology
		Resources (Galpern et al., 2012). Please use
		citation('allelematch') to call the full citation. For users
		with access to the associated journal article, tutorial
		material is also available as supplementary material to the
		article describing this software, the citation for which can be
		called using citation('allelematch').
