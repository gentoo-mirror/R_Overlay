		Identifying Unique Multilocus Genotypes where Genotyping Error
		and Missing Data may be Present // Tools for the identification
		of unique of multilocus genotypes when both genotyping error
		and missing data may be present; targeted for use with large
		datasets and databases containing multiple samples of each
		individual (a common situation in conservation genetics,
		particularly in non-invasive wildlife sampling applications).
		Functions explicitly incorporate missing data and can tolerate
		allele mismatches created by genotyping error. If you use this
		package, please cite the original publication in Molecular
		Ecology Resources (Galpern et al., 2012), the details for which
		can be generated using citation('allelematch'). For a complete
		vignette, please access via the Data S1 Supplementary
		documentation and tutorials (PDF) located at
		doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2012.03137.x.
