		Macroeconomics Tools // Provides a number of functions to
		facilitate the handling and production of reports using time
		series data. The package was developed to be understandable for
		beginners, so some functions aim to transform processes that
		would be complex into functions with a few lines. The main
		advantage of using the 'metools' package is the ease of
		producing reports and working with time series using a few
		lines of code, so the code is clean and easy to
		understand/maintain. Learn more about the 'metools' at
		https://metoolsr.wordpress.com.
