		Configuration of Jupiter's Four Largest Satellites // Calculate,
		plot and animate the configuration of Jupiter's four largest
		satellites (known as Galilean satellites) for a given date and
		time (UTC - Coordinated Universal Time). The galsat() function
		returns numerical values of the satellites positions. x  the
		apparent rectangular coordinate of the satellite with respect
		to the center of Jupiters disk in the equatorial plane in the
		units of Jupiters equatorial radius; X is positive toward the
		west, y  the apparent rectangular coordinate of the satellite
		with respect to the center of Jupiters disk from the equatorial
		plane in the units of Jupiters equatorial radius; Y is positive
		toward the north. For more details see Meeus (1988, ISBN
		0-943396-22-0) "Astronomical Formulae for Calculators". The
		galsat_animate() function creates an animation of the Galilean
		satellites' positions. You provide the starting time, duration,
		the time step between frames, and the pause between frames. The
		function delta_t() returns the value of delta-T in units of
		seconds.
