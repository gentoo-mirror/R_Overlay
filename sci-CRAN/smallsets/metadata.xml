		The Smallset Timeline Builder // Data practitioners regularly use
		the 'R' and 'Python' programming languages to prepare data for
		analyses. Thus, they encode data preprocessing decisions in 'R'
		and 'Python' scripts. The 'smallsets' package subsequently
		decodes these decisions into a Smallset Timeline, a
		visualisation proposed in Lucchesi et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1145/3531146.3533175. A Smallset Timeline is a series of
		small data snapshots of different preprocessing steps. The
		'smallsets' package builds this figure from a user's dataset
		and 'R'/'Python' preprocessing script, which contains
		structured comments with snapshot instructions.
