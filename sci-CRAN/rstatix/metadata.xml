		Pipe-Friendly Framework for Basic Statistical Tests // Provides a
		simple and intuitive pipe-friendly framework, coherent with the
		'tidyverse' design philosophy, for performing basic statistical
		tests, including t-test, Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis
		and correlation analyses. The output of each test is
		automatically transformed into a tidy data frame to facilitate
		visualization. Additional functions are available for
		reshaping, reordering, manipulating and visualizing correlation
		matrix. Functions are also included to facilitate the analysis
		of factorial experiments, including purely 'within-Ss' designs
		(repeated measures), purely 'between-Ss' designs, and mixed
		'within-and-between-Ss' designs. It's also possible to compute
		several effect size metrics, including "eta squared" for ANOVA,
		"Cohen's d" for t-test and "Cramer's V" for the association
		between categorical variables. The package contains helper
		functions for identifying univariate and multivariate outliers,
		assessing normality and homogeneity of variances.
