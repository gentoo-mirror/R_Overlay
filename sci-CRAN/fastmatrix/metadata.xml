		Fast Computation of some Matrices Useful in Statistics // Small
		set of functions designed to speed up the computation of
		certain matrix operations that are commonly used in statistics
		and econometrics. It provides efficient implementations for the
		computation of several structured matrices, matrix
		decompositions and statistical procedures, many of which have
		minimal memory overhead. Furthermore, the package provides
		interfaces to C code callable by another C code from other R
		packages.
