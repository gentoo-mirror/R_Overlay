		Fast Computation of some Matrices Useful in Statistics // Small
		set of functions to fast computation of some matrices and
		operations useful in statistics and econometrics. Currently,
		there are functions for efficient computation of duplication,
		commutation and symmetrizer matrices with minimal storage
		requirements. Some commonly used matrix decompositions (LU and
		LDL), basic matrix operations (for instance, Hadamard,
		Kronecker products and the Sherman-Morrison formula) and
		iterative solvers for linear systems are also available. In
		addition, the package includes a number of common statistical
		procedures such as the sweep operator, weighted mean and
		covariance matrix using an online algorithm, linear regression
		(using Cholesky, QR, SVD, sweep operator and conjugate
		gradients methods), ridge regression (with optimal selection of
		the ridge parameter considering the GCV procedure), functions
		to compute the multivariate skewness, kurtosis, Mahalanobis
		distance (checking the positive defineteness) and the Wilson-
		Hilferty transformation of chi squared variables. Furthermore,
		the package provides interfaces to C code callable by another C
		code from other R packages.
