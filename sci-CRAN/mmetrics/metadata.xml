		Easy Computation of Marketing Metrics with Different Analysis
		Axis // Provides a mechanism for easy computation of marketing
		metrics. By default in this package, metrics for digital
		marketing (e.g. CTR (Click Through Rate), CVR (Conversion
		Rate), CPC (Cost Per Click) etc) are calculated but you can
		define your own metrics easily. In addition to that, you can
		change an analysis axis to calculate these metrics.
