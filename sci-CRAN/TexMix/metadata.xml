		Supporting Functions and Data for Geo-Spatial Analytics Courses
		at UTDallas, Texas // A collection of functions and data -
		mostly from Texas - is provided. These are used as teaching
		tools for geo-spatial data analytics courses in the GISciences
		program at The University of Texas at Dallas. In addition,
		several vignettes illustrate geo-spatial data analytics
		practices, such as relative risk kernel density estimations
		based on food store locations within Dallas County or the
		identification of homogenous and spatially contiguous market
		areas built on socio-economic, demographic and infrastructure
		census information. The spatial resolution of the data-sets
		ranges from 1623 food store locations, over geo-referenced
		areal data of 258 Texan counties, to 529 census tracts as well
		as 1669 block groups in Dallas County. Cartographic,
		specialized regression and data handling functions are
		provided.
