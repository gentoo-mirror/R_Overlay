		Proximal/Distal Modeling Framework for Pavlovian Conditioning
		Phenomena // Fits a model of Pavlovian conditioning phenomena,
		such as response extinction and spontaneous recovery, and
		partial reinforcement extinction effects. Competing proximal
		and distal reward predictions, computed using fast and slow
		learning rates, combine according to their uncertainties and
		the recency of information. The resulting mean prediction
		drives the response rate.
