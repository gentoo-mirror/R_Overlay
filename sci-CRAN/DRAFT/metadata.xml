		Disease Rapid Analysis and Forecasting Tool // Fits epidemic data
		to and generates stochastic profiles of a model with constant
		or time-dependent behavior modification parameters. Two
		parameters, p and q, describe the effect of reduced contact
		rate of susceptible and infectious populations, respectively as
		described by Brauer (2011, ISSN:1471-2458). In the absence of
		behavior modification, p=q=1, we recover the familiar
		compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) equations.
		'DRAFT' supports both constant values for p and q and a time-
		dependent form which smoothly changes p and q from their
		initial, pre-epidemic value of 1.0 to the user chosen values
		that are between 0 and 1. The start and transient time of
		behavior change are set by the user. 'DRAFT' can be used to
		compare forecasts of epidemic incidence with and without
		behavior modification.  Additional parameters and data fitting
		methods are explained in Ben-Nun et al (2019)
