		Constrained Triangulation for Simple Features // Build a
		constrained high quality Delaunay triangulation from simple
		features objects, applying constraints based on input line
		segments, and triangle properties including maximum area,
		minimum internal angle. The triangulation code in 'RTriangle'
		uses the method of Cheng, Dey and Shewchuk (2012,
		ISBN:9781584887300). For a low-dependency alternative with low-
		quality path-based constrained  triangulation see
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=decido and for high-quality
		configurable triangulation see
		https://github.com/hypertidy/anglr. Also consider comparison
		with the 'GEOS' lib which since version 3.10.0 includes a low
		quality polygon triangulation method that starts with ear
		clipping and refines to Delaunay.
