		Adrian Dusa's Miscellaneous // Contains functions used across
		packages 'declared', 'DDIwR', 'mixed', 'QCA' and 'venn'.
		Interprets and translates, factorizes and negates SOP - Sum of
		Products expressions, for both binary and multi-value crisp
		sets, and extracts information (set names, set values) from
		those expressions. Other functions perform various other checks
		if possibly numeric (even if all numbers reside in a character
		vector) and coerce to numeric, or check if the numbers are
		whole. It also offers, among many others, a highly versatile
		recoding routine and a more flexible alternative to the base
		function 'with()'. Some of the functions in this package use
		related functions from package 'QCA'. Users are encouraged to
		install that package despite not being listed in the Imports
		field, due to circular dependency issues.
