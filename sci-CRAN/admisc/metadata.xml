		Adrian Dusa's Miscellaneous // Contains functions used across
		packages 'QCA', 'DDIwR', 'mixed' and 'venn'. Interprets and
		translates, factorizes and negates SOP - Sum of Products
		expressions, for both binary and multi-value crisp sets, and
		extracts information (set names, set values) from those
		expressions. Other functions perform various other checks if
		possibly numeric (even if all numbers reside in a character
		vector) and coerce to numeric, or check if the numbers are
		whole. It also offers, among many others, a highly flexible
		recoding routine.
