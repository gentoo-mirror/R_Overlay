		Adrian Dusa's Miscellaneous // Contains functions used across
		packages 'QCA', 'DDIwR', and 'venn'. Interprets and translates
		SOP - Sum of Products expressions, for both binary and multi-
		value crisp sets, and extracts information (set names, set
		values) from those expressions. Other functions perform various
		other checks if possibly numeric (even if all numbers reside in
		a character vector) and coerce to numeric, or check if the
		numbers are whole. It also offers, among others, a highly
		flexible recoding function. Some functions need specific
		functionality from package QCA, but since that package depends
		on this package, admisc cannot automatically load package QCA
		due to circular dependency.
