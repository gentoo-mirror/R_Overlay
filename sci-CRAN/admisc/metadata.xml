		Adrian Dusa's Miscellaneous // Contains functions used across
		packages 'QCA', 'DDIwR', and 'venn'. Interprets and translates
		DNF - Disjunctive Normal Form expressions, for both binary and
		multi-value crisp sets, and extracts information (set names,
		set values) from those expressions. Other functions perform
		various other checks if possibly numeric (even if all numbers
		reside in a character vector) and coerce to numeric, or check
		if the numbers are whole. It also offers, among many others, a
		highly flexible recoding function.
