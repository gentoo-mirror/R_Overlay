		Tests for Survival Data in General Factorial Designs //
		Implemented are three Wald-type statistic and respective
		permuted versions for null hypotheses formulated in terms of
		cumulative hazard rate functions, medians and the concordance
		measure, respectively, in the general framework of survival
		factorial designs with possibly heterogeneous survival and/or
		censoring distributions, for crossed designs with an arbitrary
		number of factors and nested designs with up to three factors.
