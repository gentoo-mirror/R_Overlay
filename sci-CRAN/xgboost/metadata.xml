		Extreme Gradient Boosting // Extreme Gradient Boosting, which is
		an efficient implementation of gradient boosting framework.
		This package is its R interface. The package includes efficient
		linear model solver and tree learning algorithms. The package
		can automatically do parallel computation on a single machine
		which could be more than 10 times faster than existing gradient
		boosting packages. It supports various objective functions,
		including regression, classification and ranking. The package
		is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to
		define their own objectives easily.
