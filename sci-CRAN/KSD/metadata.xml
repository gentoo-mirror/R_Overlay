		Goodness-of-Fit Tests using Kernelized Stein Discrepancy // An
		adaptation of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy, this package
		provides a goodness-of-fit test of whether a given i.i.d.
		sample is drawn from a given distribution. It works for any
		distribution once its score function (the derivative of log-
		density) can be provided. This method is based on "A Kernelized
		Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests and Model
		Evaluation" by Liu, Lee, and Jordan, available at
		arXiv:1602.03253.
