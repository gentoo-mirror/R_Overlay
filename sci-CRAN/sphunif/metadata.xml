		Uniformity Tests on the Circle, Sphere, and Hypersphere //
		Implementation of uniformity tests on the circle and
		(hyper)sphere. The main function of the package is unif_test(),
		which conveniently collects more than 30 tests for assessing
		uniformity on S^{p-1}={x in R^p : ||x||=1}, p = 2. The test
		statistics are implemented in the unif_stat() function, which
		allows computing several statistics to several samples within a
		single call, thus facilitating Monte Carlo experiments.
		Furthermore, the unif_stat_MC() function allows parallelizing
		them in a simple way. The asymptotic null distributions of the
		statistics are available through the function
		unif_stat_distr(). The core of 'sphunif' is coded in C++ by
		relying on the 'Rcpp' package. The package also provides
		several novel datasets and gives the reproducibility for the
		data application in Garca-Portugus, Navarro-Esteban and Cuesta-
		Albertos (2020) arXiv:2008.09897.
