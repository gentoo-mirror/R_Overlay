		Uniformity Tests on the Circle, Sphere, and Hypersphere //
		Implementation of uniformity tests on the circle and
		(hyper)sphere. The main function of the package is unif_test(),
		which conveniently collects more than 35 tests for assessing
		uniformity on S^{p-1} = {x in R^p : ||x|| = 1}, p = 2. The test
		statistics are implemented in the unif_stat() function, which
		allows computing several statistics for different samples
		within a single call, thus facilitating Monte Carlo
		experiments. Furthermore, the unif_stat_MC() function allows
		parallelizing them in a simple way. The asymptotic null
		distributions of the statistics are available through the
		function unif_stat_distr(). The core of 'sphunif' is coded in
		C++ by relying on the 'Rcpp' package. The package also provides
		several novel datasets and gives the replicability for the data
