		Available Light Within the Water Column and on the Seafloor of
		Arctic Fjords // Satellite data collected between 2003 and
		2022, in conjunction with gridded bathymetric data (50-150 m
		resolution), are used to estimate the irradiance reaching the
		bottom of a series of representative EU Arctic fjords. An Earth
		System Science Data (ESSD) manuscript, Schlegel et al. (2024),
		provides a detailed explanation of the methodology.
