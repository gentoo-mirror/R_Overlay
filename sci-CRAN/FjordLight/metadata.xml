		Available Light Within the Water Column and Seafloor of Arctic
		Fjords // Satellite data collected between 2003 and 2022, in
		conjunction with gridded bathymetric data (50-150 m
		resolution), are used to estimate the irradiance reaching the
		bottom of a series of representative EU Arctic fjords. An Earth
		System Science Data (ESSD) manuscript, Schlegel et al. (2023,
		in review), that provides a detailed explanation of the
		methodology is currently in review.
