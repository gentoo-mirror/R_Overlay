		The Nonparametric Classification Methods for Cognitive Diagnosis
		// Statistical tools for analyzing cognitive diagnosis (CD)
		data collected from small settings using the nonparametric
		classification (NPCD) framework. The core methods of the NPCD
		framework includes the nonparametric classification (NPC)
		method developed by Chiu and Douglas (2013)
		DOI:10.1007/s00357-013-9132-9 and the general NPC (GNPC) method
		developed by Chiu, Sun, and Bian (2018)
		DOI:10.1007/s11336-017-9595-4 and Chiu and Khn (2019)
		DOI:10.1007/s11336-019-09660-x. An extension of the NPCD
		framework included in the package is the nonparametric method
		for multiple-choice items (MC-NPC) developed by Wang, Chiu, and
		Koehn (2023) DOI:10.3102/10769986221133088.  Functions
		associated with various extensions concerning the evaluation,
		validation, and feasibility of the CD analysis are also
		provided. These topics include the completeness of Q-matrix,
		Q-matrix refinement method, as well as Q-matrix estimation.
