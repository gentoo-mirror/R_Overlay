		Methods for Transition Probabilities // Provides a function for
		estimating the transition probabilities in an illness-death
		model. The transition probabilities can be estimated from the
		unsmoothed landmark estimators developed by de Una-Alvarez and
		Meira-Machado (2015) doi:10.1111/biom.12288. Presmoothed
		estimates can also be obtained through the use of a parametric
		family of binary regression curves, such as logit, probit or
		cauchit. The additive logistic regression model and
		nonparametric regression are also alternatives which have been
		implemented. The idea behind the presmoothed landmark
		estimators is to use the presmoothing techniques developed by
		Cao et al. (2005) doi:10.1007/s00180-007-0076-6 in the landmark
		estimation of the transition probabilities.
