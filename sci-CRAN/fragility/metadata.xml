		Assessing and Visualizing Fragility of Clinical Results with
		Binary Outcomes // A collection of user-friendly functions for
		assessing and visualizing fragility of individual studies
		(Walsh et al., 2014 doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.10.019; Lin,
		2020 doi:10.1111/jep.13428), conventional pairwise meta-
		analyses (Atal et al., 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.03.012), and network meta-analyses
		of multiple treatments with binary outcomes (Xing et al., 2020
		doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.07.003). The included functions are
		designed to: 1) calculate the fragility index (i.e., the
		minimal event status modifications that can alter the
		significance or non-significance of the original result) and
		fragility quotient (i.e., fragility index divided by sample
		size) at a specific significance level; 2) give the cases of
		event status modifications for altering the result's
		significance or non-significance and visualize these cases; 3)
		visualize the trend of statistical significance as event status
		is modified; 4) efficiently derive fragility indexes and
		fragility quotients at multiple significance levels, and
		visualize the relationship between these fragility measures
		against the significance levels; and 5) calculate fragility
		indexes and fragility quotients of multiple datasets (e.g., a
		collection of clinical trials or meta-analyses) and produce
		plots of their overall distributions. The outputs from these
		functions may inform the robustness of clinical results in
		terms of statistical significance and aid the interpretation of
		fragility measures.
