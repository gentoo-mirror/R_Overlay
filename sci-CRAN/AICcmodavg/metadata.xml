		Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Based on (Q)AIC(c) //
		Functions to implement model selection and multimodel inference
		based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the second-
		order AIC (AICc), as well as their quasi-likelihood
		counterparts (QAIC, QAICc) from various model object classes.
		The package implements classic model averaging for a given
		parameter of interest or predicted values, as well as a
		shrinkage version of model averaging parameter estimates or
		effect sizes.  The package includes diagnostics and goodness-
		of-fit statistics for certain model types including those of
		'unmarkedFit' classes estimating demographic parameters after
		accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.  Some
		functions also allow the creation of model selection tables for
		Bayesian models of the 'bugs' and 'rjags' classes.  Objects
		following model selection and multimodel inference can be
		formatted to LaTeX using 'xtable' methods included in the
		package.
