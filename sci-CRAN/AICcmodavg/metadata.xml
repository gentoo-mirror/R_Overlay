		Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Based on (Q)AIC(c) //
		This package includes functions to create model selection
		tables based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the
		second-order AIC (AICc), as well as their quasi-likelihood
		counterparts (QAIC, QAICc).  The package also features
		functions to conduct classic model averaging (multimodel
		inference) for a given parameter of interest or predicted
		values, as well as a shrinkage version of model averaging
		parameter estimates.  Other handy functions enable the
		computation of relative variable importance, evidence ratios,
		and confidence sets for the best model.  The present version
		works with Cox proportional hazards models and conditional
		logistic regression ('coxph' and 'coxme' classes), linear
		models ('lm' class), generalized linear models ('glm', 'vglm',
		'hurdle', and 'zeroinfl' classes), linear models fit by
		generalized least squares ('gls' class), linear mixed models
		('lme' class), generalized linear mixed models ('mer' and
		'merMod' classes), multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions
		('multinom'}, 'polr', 'clm', and 'clmm' classes), robust
		regression models ('rlm' class), beta regression models
		('betareg' class), parametric survival models ('survreg'
		class), nonlinear models ('nls' and 'gnls' classes), and
		nonlinear mixed models ('nlme' and 'nlmer' classes).  The
		package also supports various models of 'unmarkedFit' and
		'maxLikeFit' classes estimating demographic parameters after
		accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.  Some
		functions also allow the creation of model selection tables for
		Bayesian models of the 'bugs' and 'rjags' classes.  Objects
		following model selection and multimodel inference can be
		formatted to LaTeX using 'xtable' methods included in the
		package.
