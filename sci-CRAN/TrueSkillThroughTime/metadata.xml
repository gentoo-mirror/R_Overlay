		Skill Estimation Based on a Single Bayesian Network // Most
		estimators implemented by the video game industry cannot obtain
		reliable initial estimates nor guarantee comparability between
		distant estimates. TrueSkill Through Time solves all these
		problems by modeling the entire history of activities using a
		single Bayesian network allowing the information to propagate
		correctly throughout the system. This algorithm requires only a
		few iterations to converge, allowing millions of observations
		to be analyzed using any low-end computer. Landfried G, Mocskos
		E (2025). "TrueSkill Through Time: Reliable Initial Skill
		Estimates and Historical Comparability with Julia, Python, and
		R." doi:10.18637/jss.v112.i06. The core ideas implemented in
		this project were developed by Dangauthier P, Herbrich R, Minka
		T, Graepel T (2007). "Trueskill through time: Revisiting the
		history of chess.".
