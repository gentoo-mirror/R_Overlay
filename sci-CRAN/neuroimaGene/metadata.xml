		Transcriptomic Atlas of Neuroimaging Derived Phenotypes //
		Contains functions to query and visualize the Neuroimaging
		features associated with genetically regulated gene expression
		(GReX). The primary utility, neuroimaGene(), relies on a list
		of user-defined genes and returns a table of neuroimaging
		features (NIDPs) associated with each gene. This resource is
		designed to assist in the interpretation of genome-wide and
		transcriptome-wide association studies that evaluate brain
		related traits. Bledsoe (2024) doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2024.06.002.
		In addition there are several visualization functions that
		generate summary plots and 2-dimensional visualizations of
		regional brain measures. Mowinckel (2020).
