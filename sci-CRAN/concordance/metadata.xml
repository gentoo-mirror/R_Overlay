		International Trade Classification (SITC1, SITC2, SITC3,
		SITC4), the North American Industry Classification System
		(NAICS combined), as well as the Broad Economic Categories
		(BEC), the International Standard of Industrial Classification
		(ISIC), and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). It
		also provides code nomenclature/descriptions look-up, Rauch
		classification look-up (via concordance to SITC2), and trade
		elasticity look-up (via concordance to HS0 or SITC3 codes).
