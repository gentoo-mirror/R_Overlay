		Robust Angle Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained // A
		robust alternative to the aJIVE (angle based Joint and
		Individual Variation Explained) method (Feng et al 2018:
		doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2018.03.008) for the estimation of joint and
		individual components in the presence of outliers in multi-
		source data. It decomposes the multi-source data into joint,
		individual and residual (noise) contributions. The
		decomposition is robust to outliers and noise in the data. The
		method is illustrated in Ponzi et al (2021) arXiv:2101.09110.
