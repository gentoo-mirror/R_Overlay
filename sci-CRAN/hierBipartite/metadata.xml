		Bipartite Graph-Based Hierarchical Clustering // Bipartite graph-
		based hierarchical clustering, developed for pharmacogenomic
		datasets and datasets sharing the same data structure. The goal
		is to construct a hierarchical clustering of groups of samples
		based on association patterns between two sets of variables. In
		the context of pharmacogenomic datasets, the samples are cell
		lines, and the two sets of variables are typically expression
		levels and drug sensitivity values. For this method, sparse
		canonical correlation analysis from Lee, W., Lee, D., Lee, Y.
		and Pawitan, Y. (2011) doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1638 is first
		applied to extract association patterns for each group of
		samples. Then, a nuclear norm-based dissimilarity measure is
		used to construct a dissimilarity matrix between groups based
		on the extracted associations. Finally, hierarchical clustering
		is applied.
