		Semi-Supervised Classification Methods // Provides a collection
		of self-labeled techniques for semi-supervised classification.
		In semi-supervised classification, both labeled and unlabeled
		data are used to train a classifier. This learning paradigm has
		obtained promising results, specifically in the presence of a
		reduced set of labeled examples. This package implements a
		collection of self-labeled techniques to construct a
		classification model. This family of techniques enlarges the
		original labeled set using the most confident predictions to
		classify unlabeled data. The techniques implemented can be
		applied to classification problems in several domains by the
		specification of a supervised base classifier. At low ratios of
		labeled data, it can be shown to perform better than classical
		supervised classifiers.
