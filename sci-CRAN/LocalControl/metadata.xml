		Nonparametric Methods for Generating High Quality Comparative
		Effectiveness Evidence // Implements novel nonparametric
		approaches to address biases and confounding when comparing
		treatments or exposures in observational studies of outcomes.
		While designed and appropriate for use in studies involving
		medicine and the life sciences, the package can be used in
		other situations involving outcomes with multiple confounders.
		The package implements a family of methods for non-parametric
		bias correction when comparing treatments in observational
		studies, including survival analysis settings, where competing
		risks and/or censoring may be present. The approach extends to
		bias-corrected personalized predictions of treatment outcome
		differences, and analysis of heterogeneity of treatment effect-
		sizes across patient subgroups. For further details, please
