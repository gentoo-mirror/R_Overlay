		Local Control: An R Package for Generating High Quality
		Comparative Effectiveness Evidence // Implements novel
		nonparametric approaches to address biases and confounding when
		comparing treatments or exposures in observational studies of
		outcomes. While designed and appropriate for use in studies
		involving medicine and the life sciences, the package can be
		used in other situations involving outcomes with multiple
		confounders. The package implements a family of methods for
		nonparametric bias correction when comparing treatments in
		cross-sectional, case-control, and survival analysis settings,
		including competing risks with censoring. The approach extends
		to bias-corrected personalized predictions of treatment outcome
		differences, and analysis of heterogeneity of treatment effect-
		sizes across patient subgroups.
