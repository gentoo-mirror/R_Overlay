		Create Logical Pairwise Comparison Matrix for the Analytic
		Hierarchy Process // Create Pairwise Comparison Matrices for
		use in the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The Pairwise Comparison
		Matrix created will be a logical matrix, which unlike a random
		comparison matrix, is similar to what a rational decision maker
		would create on the basis of a preference vector for the
		alternatives considered.
