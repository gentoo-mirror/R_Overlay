		Estimate Insect Survival from Fluorescence Data // Use
		spectrophotometry measurements performed on insects as a way to
		infer pathogens virulence. Insect movements cause fluctuations
		in fluorescence signal, and functions are provided to estimate
		when the insect has died as the moment when variance in
		autofluorescence signal drops to zero. The package provides
		functions to obtain this estimate together with functions to
		import spectrophotometry data from a Biotek microplate reader.
		Details of the method are given in Parthuisot et al. (2018)
