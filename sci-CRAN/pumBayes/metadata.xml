		Bayesian Estimation of Probit Unfolding Models for Binary
		Preference Data // Bayesian estimation and analysis methods for
		Probit Unfolding Models (PUMs), a novel class of scaling models
		designed for binary preference data. These models allow for
		both monotonic and non-monotonic response functions. The
		package supports Bayesian inference for both static and dynamic
		PUMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms with
		minimal or no tuning. Key functionalities include posterior
		sampling, hyperparameter selection, data preprocessing, model
		fit evaluation, and visualization. The methods are particularly
		suited to analyzing voting data, such as from the U.S. Congress
		or Supreme Court, but can also be applied in other contexts
		where non-monotonic responses are expected. For methodological
		details, see Shi et al. (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2504.00423.
