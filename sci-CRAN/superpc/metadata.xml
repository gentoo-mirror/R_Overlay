		Supervised Principal Components // Does prediction in the case of
		a censored survival outcome, or a regression outcome, using the
		"supervised principal component" approach. 'Superpc' is
		especially useful for high-dimensional data when the number of
		features p dominates the number of samples n (p  n paradigm),
		as generated, for instance, by high-throughput technologies.
