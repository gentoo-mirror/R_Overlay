		Species Identity and Evolution in R // Analysis of species limits
		and DNA barcoding data. Included are functions for generating
		important summary statistics from DNA barcode data, assessing
		specimen identification efficacy, testing and optimizing
		divergence threshold limits, assessment of diagnostic
		nucleotides, and calculation of the probability of reciprocal
		monophyly. Additionally, a sliding window function offers
		opportunities to analyse information across a gene, often used
		for marker design in degraded DNA studies. Further information
		on the package has been published in Brown et al (2012)
