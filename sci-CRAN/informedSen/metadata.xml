		Sensitivity Analysis Informed by a Test for Bias // After testing
		for biased treatment assignment in an observational study using
		an unaffected outcome, the sensitivity analysis is constrained
		to be compatible with that test.  The package uses the
		optimization software gurobi obtainable from
		https://www.gurobi.com/, together with its associated R
		package, also called gurobi; see: https://www.gurobi.com/docume
		ntation/7.0/refman/installing_the_r_package.html.  The method
		is a substantial computational and practical enhancement of a
		concept introduced in Rosenbaum (1992) Detecting bias with
		confidence in observational studies Biometrika, 79(2), 367-374
