		Collection of Scripts for Interface Between 'Cornerstone' and 'R'
		// Collection of generic 'R' scripts which enable you to use
		existing 'R' routines in 'Cornerstone'. --- The desktop
		application 'Cornerstone'
		(https://www.camline.com/en/products/cornerstone/cornerstone-
		core.html) is a data analysis software provided by 'camLine'
		that empowers engineering teams to find solutions even faster.
		The engineers incorporate intensified hands-on statistics into
		their projects. They benefit from an intuitive and uniquely
		designed graphical Workmap concept: you design experiments
		(DoE) and explore data, analyze dependencies, and find answers
		you can act upon, immediately, interactively, and without any
		programming. --- While 'Cornerstone's' interface to the
		statistical programming language 'R' has been available since
		version 6.0, the latest interface with 'R' is even much more
		efficient. 'Cornerstone' release 7.1.1 allows you to integrate
		user defined 'R' packages directly into the standard
		'Cornerstone' GUI. Your engineering team stays in
		'Cornerstone's' graphical working environment and can apply 'R'
		routines, immediately and without the need to deal with
		programming code. --- Learn how to use 'R' packages in
		'Cornerstone' 7.1.1 on 'camLineTV' YouTube channel
		(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEQHwq_laXU) (available in
		German).
