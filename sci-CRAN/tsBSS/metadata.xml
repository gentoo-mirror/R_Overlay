		Blind Source Separation and Supervised Dimension Reduction for
		Time Series // Different estimators are provided to solve the
		blind source separation problem for multivariate time series
		with stochastic volatility and supervised dimension reduction
		problem for multivariate time series. Different functions based
		on AMUSE and SOBI are also provided for estimating the
		dimension of the white noise subspace. The package is fully
		described in Nordhausen, Matilainen, Miettinen, Virta and
		Taskinen (2021) doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i15.
