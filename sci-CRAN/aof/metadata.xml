		Ontogenetic Shifts in Central-Place Foraging Insects // A
		breakpoint-based method to detect ontogenetic shifts in
		univariate time-activity budget series of central-place
		foraging insects. The method finds a single breakpoint
		according to the likelihood function. The method was developed
		with honey bees in order to detect the Age at Onset of Foraging
		(AOF), but can be used for the detection of other ontogenetic
		shifts in other central-place foraging insects.
