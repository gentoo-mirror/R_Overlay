		Robust Clustering Procedures // A clustering algorithm similar to
		K-Means is implemented, it has two main advantages, namely (a)
		The estimator is resistant to outliers, that means that results
		of estimator are still correct when there are atypical values
		in the sample and (b) The estimator is efficient, roughly
		speaking, if there are no outliers in the sample, results will
		be similar to those obtained by a classic algorithm (K-Means).
		Clustering procedure is carried out by minimizing the overall
		robust scale so-called tau scale. (see Gonzalez, Yohai and
		Zamar (2019) arxiv:1906.08198).
