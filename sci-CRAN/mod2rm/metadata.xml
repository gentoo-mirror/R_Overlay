		Moderation Analysis for Two-Instance Repeated Measures Designs //
		Multiple moderation analysis for two-instance repeated measures
		designs, with up to three simultaneous moderators (dichotomous
		and/or continuous) with additive or multiplicative
		relationship. Includes analyses of simple slopes and
		conditional effects at (automatically determined or manually
		set) values of the moderator(s), as well as an implementation
		of the Johnson-Neyman procedure for determining regions of
		significance in single moderator models. Based on Montoya, A.
		K. (2018) "Moderation analysis in two-instance repeated
		measures designs: Probing methods and multiple moderator
		models" doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1088-6 .
