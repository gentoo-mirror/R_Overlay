		Analysis with the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES)
		Function // Tools for econometric analysis and economic
		modelling with the traditional two-input Constant Elasticity of
		Substitution (CES) function and with nested CES functions with
		three and four inputs. The econometric estimation can be done
		by the Kmenta approximation, or non-linear least-squares using
		various gradient-based or global optimisation algorithms. Some
		of these algorithms can constrain the parameters to certain
		ranges, e.g. economically meaningful values. Furthermore, the
		non-linear least-squares estimation can be combined with a
		grid-search for the rho-parameter(s).
