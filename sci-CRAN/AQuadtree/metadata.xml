		Confidentiality of Spatial Point Data // Provides an automatic
		aggregation tool to manage point data privacy, intended to be
		helpful for the production of official spatial data and for
		researchers. The package pursues the data accuracy at the
		smallest possible areas preventing individual information
		disclosure. The methodology, based on hierarchical geographic
		data structures performs aggregation and local suppression of
		point data to ensure privacy as described in Lagonigro, R.,
		Oller, R., Martori J.C. (2017) doi:10.2436/20.8080.02.55. The
		data structures are created following the guidelines for grid
		datasets from the European Forum for Geography and Statistics.
