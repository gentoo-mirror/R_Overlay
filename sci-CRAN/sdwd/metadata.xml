		Sparse Distance Weighted Discrimination // Formulates a sparse
		distance weighted discrimination (SDWD) for high-dimensional
		classification and implements a very fast algorithm for
		computing its solution path with the L1, the elastic-net, and
		the adaptive elastic-net penalties. More details about the
		methodology SDWD is seen on Wang and Zou (2016)
		(doi:10.1080/10618600.2015.1049700).
