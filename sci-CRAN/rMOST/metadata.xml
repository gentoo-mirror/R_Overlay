		Estimates Pareto-Optimal Solution for Hiring with 3 Objectives //
		Estimates Pareto-optimal solution for personnel selection with
		3 objectives using Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) algorithm
		introduced by Das and Dennis (1998)
		doi:10.1137/S1052623496307510. Takes predictor
		intercorrelations and predictor-objective relations as input
		and generates a series of solutions containing predictor
		weights as output. Accepts between 3 and 10 selection
		predictors. Maximum 2 objectives could be adverse impact
		objectives. Partially modeled after De Corte (2006) TROFSS
		Fortran program https://users.ugent.be/~wdecorte/trofss.pdf and
		updated from 'ParetoR' package described in Song et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1037/apl0000240. For details, see Song et al. (in
		press).
