		Estimation for Multivariate Normal and Student-t Data with
		Monotone Missingness // Estimation of multivariate normal and
		student-t data of arbitrary dimension where the pattern of
		missing data is monotone. Through the use of
		parsimonious/shrinkage regressions (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge,
		etc.), where standard regressions fail, the package can handle
		a nearly arbitrary amount of missing data. The current version
		supports maximum likelihood inference and a full Bayesian
		approach employing scale-mixtures for Gibbs sampling. Monotone
		data augmentation extends this Bayesian approach to arbitrary
		missingness patterns.  A fully functional standalone interface
		to the Bayesian lasso (from Park  Casella), Normal-Gamma (from
		Griffin  Brown), Horseshoe (from Carvalho, Polson,  Scott), and
		ridge regression with model selection via Reversible Jump, and
		student-t errors (from Geweke) is also provided.
