		Functional Ensemble Survival Tree for Dynamic Prediction // A
		fast implementation of functional ensemble survival tree is
		provided to facilitate dynamic prediction with right-censored
		data. Multiple time-varying covariates can be accommodated via
		multivariate principal component analysis. These extracted
		features along with baseline covariates are nested within the
		ensemble survival tree where dynamic prediction can be done
		under user-specified sliding windows. Prediction accuracy
		measures, Area under the receiver operating characteristic
		(ROC) curve and Brier score, are provided in this package.
