		Produces 'bubbleHeatmap' Plots for Visualising Metabolomics Data
		// Plotting package based on the grid system, combining
		elements of a bubble plot and heatmap to conveniently display
		two numerical variables, (represented by color and size)
		grouped by categorical variables on the x and y axes. This is a
		useful alternative to a forest plot when the data can be
		grouped in two dimensions, such as predictors x outcomes. It
		has particular advantages for visualising the metabolic
		measures produced by the 'Nightingale Health' metabolomics
		platform, and templates are included for automatically
		generating figures from these datasets.
