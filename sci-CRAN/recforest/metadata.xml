		Random Survival Forest for Recurrent Events // Analyze recurrent
		events with right-censored data and the potential presence of a
		terminal event (that prevents further occurrences, like death).
		'recofest' extends the random survival forest algorithm,
		adapting splitting rules and node estimators to handle
		complexities of recurrent events. The methodology is fully
		described in Murris, J., Bouaziz, O., Jakubczak, M., Katsahian,
		S.,  Lavenu, A. (2024)
		(https://hal.science/hal-04612431v1/document).
