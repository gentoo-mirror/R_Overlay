		Downloading Supplementary Data from Published Manuscripts //
		Downloads data supplementary materials from manuscripts, using
		papers' DOIs as references. Facilitates open, reproducible
		research workflows: scientists re-analyzing published datasets
		can work with them as easily as if they were stored on their
		own computer, and others can track their analysis workflow
		painlessly. The main function suppdata() returns a (temporary)
		location on the user's computer where the file is stored,
		making it simple to use suppdata() with standard functions like
		read.csv().
