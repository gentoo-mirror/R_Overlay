		Tools for Simulating Direct Behavioral Observation Recording
		Procedures Based on Alternating Renewal Processes // Tools for
		simulating data generated by direct observation recording.
		Behavior streams are simulated based on an alternating renewal
		process, given specified distributions of event durations and
		interim times. Different procedures for recording data can then
		be applied to the simulated behavior streams. Functions are
		provided for the following recording methods: continuous
		duration recording, event counting, momentary time sampling,
		partial interval recording, and whole interval recording.
