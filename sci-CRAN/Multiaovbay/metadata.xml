		Classic, Nonparametric and Bayesian Two-Way Analysis of Variance
		Panel // Covers several approaches to ANOVA (Analysis of
		Variance), specifically studying a balanced two-factor fixed-
		fixed ANOVA design. It consists of four sections. The first
		section uses a dynamic scheme to indicate which possible
		alternatives to follow depending on the fulfillment of the
		assumptions of the model. It also presents an analysis on the
		fulfillment of the assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity,
		normality, and independence in the residuals of the model, as
		well as dynamic statistical graphs on the residuals of the
		model. The second section presents an analysis with a non-
		parametric approach of Kruskal Wallis. After Kruskal Wallis, a
		Post-Hoc analysis of multiple comparisons on the medians of the
		treatments is carried out. The third section presents a
		classical parametric ANOVA. Following classical ANOVA, a post-
		hoc analysis of multiple comparisons on the medians of the
		treatments, factor levels by Dunn's test, and statistical
		graphs for the treatments and factor levels are shown.
		Additionally, a post-hoc analysis of multiple comparisons on
		the means of the treatments is done. The fourth section
		presents an analysis of variance under a Bayesian approach. In
		this section, interactive statistical graphs are presented on
		the posterior distributions of treatments, factor levels, and a
		convergence analysis of the estimated parameters, using MCMC
		(Markov Chain Monte Carlo). These results are displayed in an
		interactive glossy panel which allows modification of the test
		arguments, contains interactive statistical plots, and presents
		automatic conclusions depending on the fulfillment of the
		assumptions of the balanced two-factor fixed ANOVA model.
