		GUI Tool for Data Management like SPSS or Stata // R is very
		powerful but it lacks some of the functionalities found in
		Stata or SPSS to manage survey data. The 'memisc' package
		provides these (variable labels, value labels, definable
		missing values and so on), but to efficiently work these
		functions need a graphical interface to allow the user to get
		an overview of the data. This package provides such a graphical
		interface, similar in fashion to SPSS's Variable View and data
		managing system. It uses the 'memisc' package as its backend.
		Additionally, 'Rz' has a powerful plot assistant interface
		based on 'ggplot2'.
