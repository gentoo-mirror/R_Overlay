		Mutexes, Semaphores, and Message Queues // Provides access to
		low-level operating system mechanisms for performing atomic
		operations on shared data structures. Mutexes provide shared
		and exclusive locks. Semaphores act as counters. Message queues
		move text strings from one process to another. All these
		interprocess communication (IPC) tools can optionally block
		with or without a timeout. Implemented using the cross-platform
		'boost' 'C++' library
		https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/interprocess/.
