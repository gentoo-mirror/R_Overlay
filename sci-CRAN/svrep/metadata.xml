		Tools for Creating, Updating, and Analyzing Survey Replicate
		Weights // Provides tools for creating and working with survey
		replicate weights, extending functionality of the 'survey'
		package from Lumley (2004) doi:10.18637/jss.v009.i08. Methods
		are provided for applying nonresponse adjustments to both full-
		sample and replicate weights as suggested by Rust and Rao
		(1996) doi:10.1177/096228029600500305 in order to account for
		the impact of these adjustments on sampling variances.
		Diagnostic functions are included to compare weights and
		weighted estimates from different sets of replicate weights.
