		Settings and File I/O using a Configuration YAML File // R data
		pipelines commonly require reading and writing data to
		versioned directories. Each directory might correspond to one
		step of a multi-step process, where that version corresponds to
		particular settings for that step and a chain of previous steps
		that each have their own versions. This package creates a
		configuration object that makes it easy to read and write
		versioned data, based on YAML configuration files loaded and
		saved to each versioned folder.
