		Perform the Weighted Multiplier Method on Trees // When many
		possible multiplier method estimates of a target population are
		available, a weighted sum of estimates from each back-
		calculated path can be achieved with this package.  Variance-
		minimizing weights are used and with any admissible tree-
		structured data.  The methodological basis used to create this
		package can be found in Flynn (2023)
