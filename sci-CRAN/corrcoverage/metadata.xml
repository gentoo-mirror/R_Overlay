		Corrected the Coverage of Credible Sets from Bayesian Genetic
		Fine Mapping // Using a computationally efficient method, the
		package can be used to find the corrected coverage estimate of
		a credible set of putative causal variants from Bayesian
		genetic fine-mapping. The package can also be used to obtain a
		corrected credible set if required; that is, the smallest set
		of variants required such that the corrected coverage estimate
		of the resultant credible set is within some user defined
		accuracy of the desired coverage. Maller et al. (2012)
