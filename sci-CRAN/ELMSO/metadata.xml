		Implementation of the Efficient Large-Scale Online Display
		Advertising Algorithm // An implementation of the algorithm
		described in "Efficient Large- Scale Internet Media Selection
		Optimization for Online Display Advertising" by Paulson, Luo,
		and James (Journal of Marketing Research 2018; see URL below
		for journal text/citation and http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu
		/gareth-james/Research/ELMSO.pdf for a full-text version of the
		paper). The algorithm here is designed to allocate budget
		across a set of online advertising opportunities using a
		coordinate-descent approach, but it can be used in any
		resource-allocation problem with a matrix of visitation (in the
		case of the paper, website page- views) and channels (in the
		paper, websites). The package contains allocation functions
		both in the presence of bidding, when allocation is dependent
		on channel-specific cost curves, and when advertising costs are
		fixed at each channel.
