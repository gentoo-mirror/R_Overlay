		Split Regularized Regression // Functions for computing split
		regularized estimators defined in Christidis, Lakshmanan,
		Smucler and Zamar (2019) doi:10.48550/arXiv.1712.03561. The
		approach fits linear regression models that split the set of
		covariates into groups. The optimal split of the variables into
		groups and the regularized estimation of the regression
		coefficients are performed by minimizing  an objective function
		that encourages sparsity within each group and diversity among
		them. The estimated coefficients are then pooled together to
		form the final fit.
