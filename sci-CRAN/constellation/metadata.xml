		Identify Event Sequences Using Time Series Joins // Examine any
		number of time series data frames to identify instances in
		which various criteria are met within specified time frames. In
		clinical medicine, these types of events are often called
		"constellations of signs and symptoms", because a single
		condition depends on a series of events occurring within a
		certain amount of time of each other. This package was written
		to work with any number of time series data frames and is
		optimized for speed to work well with data frames with millions
		of rows.
