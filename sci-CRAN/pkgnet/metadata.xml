		Get Network Representation of an R Package // Tools from the
		domain of graph theory can be used to quantify the complexity
		and vulnerability to failure of a software package. That is the
		guiding philosophy of this package. 'pkgnet' provides tools to
		analyze the dependencies between functions in an R package and
		between its imported packages.  See the pkgnet website for
		vignettes and other supplementary information.
