		R Individual Specialization (RInSp) // Functions to calculate
		several ecological indices of individual and population niche
		width (Araujo's E, clustering and pairwise similarity among
		individuals, IS, Petraitis' W, and Roughgarden's WIC/TNW) to
		assess individual specialization based on data of resource use.
		Resource use can be quantified by counts of categories,
		measures of mass or length, or proportions. Monte Carlo
		resampling procedures are available for hypothesis testing
		against multinomial null models.
