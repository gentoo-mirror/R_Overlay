		Create Event Based Data Architectures // Event-driven programming
		is a programming paradigm where the flow of execution is
		defined by event. In this paradigm an event can be defined as
		"a change in the state" of an object. This package offers a set
		of functions for creating event-based architectures using three
		basic functions: events, dispatchers, and handlers. The
		handlers manage the events, the dispatchers are in charge of
		redirecting the events to each of the handlers, finally the
		events are the objects that carry the information about the
		change of state.
