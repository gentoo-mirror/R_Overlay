		Exploit Data Leakages in Time Series Forecasting Competitions //
		Forecasting competitions are of increasing importance as a mean
		to learn best practices and gain knowledge. Data leakage is one
		of the most common issues that can often be found in
		competitions. Data leaks can happen when the training data
		contains information about the test data. For example: randomly
		chosen blocks of time series are concatenated to form a new
		time series, scale-shifts, repeating patterns in time series,
		white noise is added in the original time series to form a new
		time series, etc.  'tsdataleaks' package can be used to detect
		data leakages in a collection of  time series.
