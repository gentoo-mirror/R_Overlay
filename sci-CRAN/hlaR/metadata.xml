		Tools for HLA Data // A streamlined tool for eplet analysis of
		donor and recipient HLA (human leukocyte antigen) mismatch.
		Messy, low-resolution HLA typing data is cleaned, and imputed
		to high-resolution using the NMDP (National Marrow Donor
		Program) haplotype reference database
		https://haplostats.org/haplostats. High resolution data is
		analyzed for overall or single antigen eplet mismatch using a
		reference table (currently supporting 'HLAMatchMaker'
		http://www.epitopes.net versions 2 and 3). Data can enter or
		exit the workflow at different points depending on the user's
		aims and initial data quality.
