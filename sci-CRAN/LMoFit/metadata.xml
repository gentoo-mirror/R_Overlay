		Advanced L-Moment Fitting of Distributions // A complete
		framework for frequency analysis is provided by 'LMoFit'. It
		has functions related to the determination of sample L-moments
		as in Hosking, J.R.M. (1990)
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1990.tb01775.x, the fitting of various
		distributions as in Zaghloul et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103720 and Hosking, J.R.M. (2019)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lmom, besides plotting and
		manipulating L-space diagrams as in Papalexiou, S.M.
		Koutsoyiannis, D. (2016) doi:10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.05.005
		for two-shape parametric distributions on the L-moment ratio
		diagram. Additionally, the quantile, probability density, and
		cumulative probability functions of various distributions are
		provided in a user-friendly manner.
