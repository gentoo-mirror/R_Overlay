		The Breakdown of Genomic Ancestry Blocks in Hybrid Lineages //
		Individual based simulations of hybridizing populations, where
		the accumulation of junctions is tracked. Furthermore,
		mathematical equations are provided to verify simulation
		outcomes. Both simulations and mathematical equations are based
		on Janzen (2018, doi:10.1101/058107) and Janzen (2022,
		doi:10.1111/1755-0998.13519).
