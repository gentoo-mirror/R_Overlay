		Derive a Color Palette from a Particular Location on Earth //
		Downloads a satellite image via ESRI and maptiles (these are
		originally from a variety of aerial photography sources),
		translates the image into a perceptually uniform color space,
		runs one of a few different clustering algorithms on the colors
		in the image searching for a user-supplied number of colors,
		and returns the resulting color palette.
