		Analysis of Event Data with Two Time Scales // Analyse time to
		event data with two time scales by estimating a smooth hazard
		that varies over two time scales and also, if covariates are
		available, to estimate a proportional hazards model with such a
		two-dimensional baseline hazard. Functions are provided to
		prepare the raw data for estimation, to estimate and to plot
		the two-dimensional smooth hazard. Extension to a competing
		risks model are implemented. For details about the method
		please refer to Carollo et al. (2024) doi:10.1002/sim.10297.
