		Bayesian Reliability Estimation // Functionality for the most
		common single test reliability estimates is provided:
		Coefficient alpha, 'Guttman's' lambda-2/-4/-6, the Greatest
		lower bound and coefficient omega. The Bayesian estimates are
		provided with credible intervals. The frequentist estimates are
		provided with bootstrapped confidence intervals The method for
		the Bayesian estimates, except for omega, is sampling from the
		posterior inverse 'Wishart' for the covariance matrix based
		measures. See 'Murphy' (2007) https://www.seas.harvard.edu/cour
		ses/cs281/papers/murphy-2007.pdf. In the case of omega it is
		'Gibbs' Sampling from the joint conditional distributions of a
		single factor model. See 'Lee' (2007,
		doi:10.1002/9780470024737). The glb method is adjusted code
		from the 'Rcsdp' package by 'Hector Corrada Bravo',
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcsdp, which now uses a
		slightly adjusted solving algorithm from the 'CSDP' library by
		'Brian Borchers' https://github.com/coin-or/Csdp/wiki,
		doi.org/10.1080/10556789908805765 lambda-4 is from 'Benton'
		(2015) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-07503-7_19; the principal factor
		analysis for the frequentist omega is from 'Schlegel' (2017)
		https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/03/iterated-principal-factor-
		method-of-factor-analysis-with-r/; and the analytic alpha
		interval is from 'Bonett' and 'Wright' (2015)
		doi:10.1002/job.1960.
