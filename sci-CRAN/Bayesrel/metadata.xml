		Bayesian Reliability Estimation // Functionality for reliability
		estimates. For 'unidimensional' tests: Coefficient alpha,
		'Guttman's' lambda-2/-4/-6, the Greatest lower bound and
		coefficient omega_u ('unidimensional') in a Bayesian and a
		frequentist version. For multidimensional tests: omega_t
		(total) and omega_h (hierarchical). The results include
		confidence and credible intervals, the probability of a
		coefficient being larger than a cutoff, and a check for the
		factor models, necessary for the omega coefficients. The method
		for the Bayesian 'unidimensional' estimates, except for
		omega_u, is sampling from the posterior inverse 'Wishart' for
		the covariance matrix based measures (see 'Murphy', 2007, https
		://groups.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/murphy-2007.pdf
		. The Bayesian omegas (u, t, and h) are obtained by 'Gibbs'
		sampling from the conditional posterior distributions of (1)
		the single factor model and (2) the second-order factor model
		('Lee', 2007, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/
		9780470024737).
