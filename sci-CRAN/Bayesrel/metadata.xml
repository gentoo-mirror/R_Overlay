		Bayesian Reliability Estimation // Functionality for the most
		common single test reliability estimates: Coefficient alpha,
		'Guttman's' lambda-2/-4/-6, the Greatest lower bound and
		coefficient omega. The Bayesian estimates are provided with
		credible intervals. The frequentist estimates are provided with
		bootstrapped confidence intervals The method for the Bayesian
		estimates, except for omega, is sampling from the posterior
		inverse 'Wishart' for the covariance matrix based measures (see
		'Murphy', 2007, https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/pape
		rs/murphy-2007.pdf. In the case of omega it is 'Gibbs' Sampling
		from the joint conditional distributions of a single factor
		model ('Lee', 2007, doi:10.1002/9780470024737). The glb method
		uses adjusted code from the 'Rcsdp' package by 'Hector Corrada
		Bravo', https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcsdp. This process
		applies a slightly adjusted solving algorithm from the 'CSDP'
		library by 'Brian Borchers' https://github.com/coin-
		or/Csdp/wiki, doi:10.1080/10556789908805765, but is wrapped in
		'RcppArmadillo'. Guttman's Lambda-4 is from 'Benton' (2015)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-07503-7_19. The principal factor analysis
		for a version of frequentist omega is from 'Schlegel' (2017)
		https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/03/iterated-principal-factor-
		method-of-factor-analysis-with-r/. The analytic confidence
		interval of alpha is from 'Bonett' and 'Wright' (2015)
		doi:10.1002/job.1960.
