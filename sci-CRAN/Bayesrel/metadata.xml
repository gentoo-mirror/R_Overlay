		Bayesian Reliability Estimation // Functionality for reliability
		estimates. For unidimensional tests: Coefficient alpha,
		'Guttman's' lambda-2/-4/-6, the Greatest lower bound and
		coefficient omega in a Bayesian and a frequentist version. For
		multidimensional tests: omega-total and omega-hierarchical. The
		results include confidence and credible intervals, the
		probability of a coefficient being larger than a cutoff, and a
		check for the factor models, necessary for the omega
		coefficients. The method for the Bayesian unidimensional
		estimates, except for omega, is sampling from the posterior
		inverse 'Wishart' for the covariance matrix based measures (see
		'Murphy', 2007, https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/p
		apers/murphy-2007.pdf. The Bayesian omegas (unidimensional,
		hierarchical, and total) are obtained by 'Gibbs' Sampling from
		the conditional posterior distributions of (1) the single
		factor model and (2) the higher order factor model ('Lee',
		2007, doi:10.1002/9780470024737).
