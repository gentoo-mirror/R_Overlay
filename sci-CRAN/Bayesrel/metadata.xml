		Bayesian Reliability Estimation // So far, it provides the most
		common single test reliability estimates, being: Coefficient
		Alpha, Guttman's lambda-2/-4/-6, greatest lower bound and
		Mcdonald's Omega. The Bayesian estimates are provided with
		credible intervals. The method for the Bayesian estimates,
		except for omega, is sampling from the posterior inverse
		Wishart for the covariance matrix based measures. See Murphy
		(2007) https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/murphy
		-2007.pdf. Gibbs Sampling from the joint conditional
		distributions of a single factor model in the case of omega.
		See Lee (2007, ISBN:978-0-470-02424-9). Methods for the glb are
		from Moltner and Revelle (2018) https://www.rdocumentation.org/
		packages/psych/versions/1.8.10/topics/glb.algebraic; lambda-4
		is from Benton (2015) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-07503-7_19; the
		principal factor analysis is from Schlegel (2017)
		https://www.r-bloggers.com/iterated-principal-factor-method-of-
		factor-analysis-with-r/; and the analytic alpha interval is
		from Bonnett and Wright (2014) doi:10.1002/job.1960.
