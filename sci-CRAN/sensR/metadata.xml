		Thurstonian Models for Sensory Discrimination // Provides methods
		for sensory discrimination methods; duotrio, tetrad, triangle,
		2-AFC, 3-AFC, A-not A, same-different, 2-AC and degree-of-
		difference. This enables the calculation of d-primes, standard
		errors of d-primes, sample size and power computations, and
		comparisons of different d-primes. Methods for profile
		likelihood confidence intervals and plotting are included. Most
		methods are described in Brockhoff, P.B. and Christensen,
		R.H.B. (2010) doi:10.1016/j.foodqual.2009.04.003.
