		Generalized Kumaraswamy Regression Models for Bounded Data //
		Implements regression models for bounded continuous data in the
		open interval (0,1) using the five-parameter Generalized
		Kumaraswamy distribution. Supports modeling all distribution
		parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, lambda) as functions of
		predictors through various link functions. Provides efficient
		maximum likelihood estimation via Template Model Builder
		('TMB'), offering comprehensive diagnostics, model comparison
		tools, and simulation methods. Particularly useful for
		analyzing proportions, rates, indices, and other bounded
		response data with complex distributional features not
		adequately captured by simpler models.
