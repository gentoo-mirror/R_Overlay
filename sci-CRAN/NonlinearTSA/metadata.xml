		Nonlinear Time Series Analysis // Function and data sets in the
		book entitled "Nonlinear Time Series Analysis with R
		Applications" B.Guris (2020). The book will be published in
		Turkish and the original name of this book will be "R
		Uygulamali Dogrusal Olmayan Zaman Serileri Analizi". It is
		possible to perform nonlinearity tests, nonlinear unit root
		tests, nonlinear cointegration tests and estimate nonlinear
		error correction models by using the functions written in this
		package. The Momentum Threshold Autoregressive (MTAR), the
		Smooth Threshold Autoregressive (STAR) and the Self Exciting
		Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) type unit root tests can be
		performed using the functions written. In addition,
		cointegration tests using the Momentum Threshold Autoregressive
		(MTAR), the Smooth Threshold Autoregressive (STAR) and the Self
		Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) models can be
		applied. It is possible to estimate nonlinear error correction
		models. The Granger causality test performed using nonlinear
		models can also be applied.
