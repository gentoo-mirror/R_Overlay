		A Wrapper Around 'rjags' to Streamline 'JAGS' Analyses // A set
		of wrappers around 'rjags' functions to run Bayesian analyses
		in 'JAGS' (specifically, via 'libjags').  A single function
		call can control adaptive, burn-in, and sampling MCMC phases,
		with MCMC chains run in sequence or in parallel. Posterior
		distributions are automatically summarized (with the ability to
		exclude some monitored nodes if desired) and functions are
		available to generate figures based on the posteriors (e.g.,
		predictive check plots, traceplots). Function inputs, argument
		syntax, and output format are nearly identical to the
		'R2WinBUGS'/'R2OpenBUGS' packages to allow easy switching
		between MCMC samplers.
