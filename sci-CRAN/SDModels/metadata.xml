		Spectrally Deconfounded Models // Screen for and analyze non-
		linear sparse direct effects in the presence of unobserved
		confounding using the spectral deconfounding techniques (evid,
		Bhlmann, and Meinshausen (2020)jmlr.org/papers/v21/19-545.html,
		Guo, evid, and Bhlmann (2022) doi:10.1214/21-AOS2152). These
		methods have been shown to be a good estimate for the true
		direct effect if we observe many covariates, e.g., high-
		dimensional settings, and we have fairly dense confounding.
		Even if the assumptions are violated, it seems like there is
		not much to lose, and the deconfounded models will, in general,
		estimate a function closer to the true one than classical least
		squares optimization. 'SDModels' provides functions SDAM() for
		Spectrally Deconfounded Additive Models (Scheidegger, Guo, and
		Bhlmann (2025) doi:10.1145/3711116) and SDForest() for
		Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests (Ulmer, Scheidegger, and
		Bhlmann (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2502.03969).
