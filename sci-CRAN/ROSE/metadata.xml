		Random Over-Sampling Examples // Functions to deal with binary
		classification problems in the presence of imbalanced classes.
		Synthetic balanced samples are generated according to ROSE
		(Menardi and Torelli, 2013). Functions that implement more
		traditional remedies to the class imbalance are also provided,
		as well as different metrics to evaluate a learner accuracy.
		These are estimated by holdout, bootstrap or cross-validation
		methods.
