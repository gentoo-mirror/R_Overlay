		Canonical Correlations and Tests of Independence // A simple
		interface for multivariate correlation analysis that unifies
		various classical statistical procedures including t-tests,
		tests in univariate and multivariate linear models, parametric
		and nonparametric tests for correlation, Kruskal-Wallis tests,
		common approximate versions of Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed
		rank tests, chi-squared tests of independence, score tests of
		particular hypotheses in generalized linear models, canonical
		correlation analysis and linear discriminant analysis.
