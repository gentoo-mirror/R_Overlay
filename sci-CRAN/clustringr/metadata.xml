		Cluster Strings by Edit-Distance // Returns an edit-distance
		based clusterization of an input vector of strings. Each
		cluster will contain a set of strings w/ small mutual edit-
		distance (e.g., Levenshtein, optimum-sequence-alignment,
		Damerau-Levenshtein), as computed by stringdist::stringdist().
		The set of all mutual edit-distances is then used by graph
		algorithms (from package 'igraph') to single out subsets of
		high connectivity.
