		Emulation of Dynamic Simulators via One-Step-Ahead Approach //
		Performs emulation of dynamic simulators using Gaussian process
		via one-step ahead approach. The package implements a flexible
		framework for approximating time-dependent outputs from
		computationally expensive dynamic systems. It is specifically
		designed for nonlinear dynamic systems where full simulations
		may be costly. The underlying Gaussian process model accounts
		for temporal dependency through the one-step-ahead formulation,
		allowing for accurate emulation of complex dynamics.
		Hyperparameters are estimated via maximum likelihood. See Heo
		(2025, doi:10.48550/arXiv.2503.20250) for exact method, and
		Mohammadi, Challenor, and Goodfellow (2019,
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2019.05.006) for methodological details.
