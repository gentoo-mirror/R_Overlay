		Handling Missing Data in Stochastic Block Models // When a
		network is partially observed (here, NAs in the adjacency
		matrix rather than 1 or 0 due to missing information between
		node pairs), it is possible to account for the underlying
		process that generates those NAs. 'missSBM', presented in
		'Barbillon, Chiquet and Tabouy' (2021)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v101.i12, adjusts the popular stochastic block
		model from network data sampled under various missing data
		conditions, as described in 'Tabouy, Barbillon and Chiquet'
