		Genotype by Environment (GxE) Analysis // Analysis of multi
		environment data of plant breeding experiments following the
		analyses described in Malosetti, Ribaut, and van Eeuwijk
		(2013), doi:10.3389/fphys.2013.00044. One of a series of
		statistical genetic packages for streamlining the analysis of
		typical plant breeding experiments developed by Biometris. Some
		functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the
		R package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be
		obtained upon purchase from 'VSN' international
