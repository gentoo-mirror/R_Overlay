		Bayesian Model Selection for Generalized Linear Mixed Models // A
		Bayesian model selection approach for generalized linear mixed
		models. Currently, 'GLMMselect' can be used for Poisson GLMM
		and Bernoulli GLMM. 'GLMMselect' can select fixed effects and
		random effects simultaneously. Covariance structures for the
		random effects are a product of a unknown scalar and a known
		semi-positive definite matrix. 'GLMMselect' can be widely used
		in areas such as longitudinal studies, genome-wide association
		studies, and spatial statistics. 'GLMMselect' is based on Xu,
		Ferreira, Porter, and Franck (202X), Bayesian Model Selection
		Method for Generalized Linear Mixed Models, Biometrics, under
		review.
