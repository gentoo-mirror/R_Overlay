		Find the Outlier by Quantile Random Forests // Provides a method
		to find the outlier in custom data by quantile random forests
		method. Introduced by Meinshausen Nicolai (2006)
		https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1248547.1248582. It directly
		calls the ranger() function of the 'ranger' package to perform
		data fitting and prediction. We also implement the evaluation
		of outlier prediction results. Compared with random forest
		detection of outliers, this method has higher accuracy and
		stability on large datasets.
