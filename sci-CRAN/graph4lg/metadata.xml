		Build Graphs for Landscape Genetics Analysis // Build graphs for
		landscape genetics analysis. This set of functions can be used
		to import and convert spatial and genetic data initially in
		different formats, import landscape graphs created with
		'GRAPHAB' software (Foltete et al., 2012)
		doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.07.002, make diagnosis plots of
		isolation by distance relationships in order to choose how to
		build genetic graphs, create graphs with a large range of
		pruning methods, weight their links with several genetic
		distances, plot and analyse graphs,   compare them with other
		graphs. It uses functions from other packages such as
		'adegenet' (Jombart, 2008) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btn129
		and 'igraph' (Csardi et Nepusz, 2006) https://bit.ly/35a3V3H.
		It also implements methods commonly used in landscape genetics
		to create graphs, described by Dyer et Nason (2004)
		doi:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02177.x and Greenbaum et Fefferman
		(2017) doi:10.1111/mec.14059, and to analyse distance data (van
		Strien et al., 2015) doi:10.1038/hdy.2014.62.
