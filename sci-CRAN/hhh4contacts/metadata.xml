		Counts // Meyer and Held (2017)
		doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw051 present an age-structured
		spatio-temporal model for infectious disease counts. The
		approach is illustrated in a case study on norovirus
		gastroenteritis in Berlin, 2011-2015, by age group, city
		district and week, using additional contact data from the
		POLYMOD survey. This package contains the data and code to
		reproduce the results from the paper, see
