		Template Engine Inspired by 'Jinja' // Template engine powered by
		the 'inja' C++ library. Users write a template document, using
		syntax inspired by the 'Jinja' Python package, and then render
		the final document by passing data from R. The template syntax
		supports features such as variables, loops, conditions and
		inheritance.
