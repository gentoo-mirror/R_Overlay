		Data Modifcation and Analysis for Communication Research //
		Provides convenience functions for common data modification and
		analysis tasks in communication research. This includes
		functions for univariate and bivariate data analysis, index
		generation and reliability computation, and intercoder
		reliability tests. All functions follow the style and syntax of
		the tidyverse, and are construed to perform their computations
		on multiple variables at once. Functions for univariate and
		bivariate data analysis comprise summary statistics for
		continouos and categorical variables, as well as several tests
		of bivariate association including effect sizes. Functions for
		data modification comprise index generation and automated
		reliability analysis of index variables. Functions for
		intercoder reliability comprise tests of several intercoder
		reliability estimates, including simple and mean pairwise
		percent agreement, Krippendorff's Alpha, and various Kappa
		coefficients.
