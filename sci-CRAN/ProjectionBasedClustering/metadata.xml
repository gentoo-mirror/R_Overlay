		Projection Based Clustering // A clustering approach for every
		projection method based on the generalized  U*-matrix
		visualization of a topographic map is made available here
		[Thrun/Ultsch,2017] DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.13124.53124. The number
		of clusters and the cluster structure can be estimated by
		counting the valleys in a topographic map. If the number of
		clusters and the clustering method are chosen correctly, then
		the clusters will be well separated by mountains in the
		visualization. Most projection methods are wrappers for already
		available methods in R. However, the neighbor retrieval
		visualizer (NeRV) is based on C++ source code of the 'dredviz'
		software package and the Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA)
		is translated from 'MATLAB' ('SOM Toolbox' 2.0) to R.
