		Projection Based Clustering // A clustering approach applicable
		to every projection method is proposed here. The two-
		dimensional scatter plot of any projection method can construct
		a topographic map which displays unapparent data structures by
		using distance and density information of the data. The
		generalized U*-matrix renders this visualization in the form of
		a topographic map, which can be used to automatically define
		the clusters of high-dimensional data. The whole system is
		based on Thrun and Ultsch, "Using Projection based Clustering
		to Find Distance and Density based Clusters in High-Dimensional
		Data" DOI:10.1007/s00357-020-09373-2. Selecting the correct
		projection method will result in a visualization in which
		mountains surround each cluster. The number of clusters can be
		determined by counting valleys on the topographic map. Most
		projection methods are wrappers for already available methods
		in R. By contrast, the neighbor retrieval visualizer (NeRV) is
		based on C++ source code of the 'dredviz' software package, and
		the Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA) is translated from
		'MATLAB' ('SOM Toolbox' 2.0) to R.
