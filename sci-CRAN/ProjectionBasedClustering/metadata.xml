		Projection Based Clustering // A clustering approach applicable
		to every projection method is proposed here [Thrun/Ultsch,2017]
		DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.13124.53124. The two-dimensional scatter
		plot of any projection method can construct a topographic map
		which displays unapparent data structures by using distance and
		density information of the data. The visualization of the
		topographic map is derived from the generalized U*-matrix.
		Thus, it can be used to define the clusters of high-dimensional
		data automatically. The whole system is a generalization of the
		book "Projection-Based Clustering through Self-Organization and
		Swarm Intelligence" DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9. Choosing a
		correct projection method will result in a visualization where
		mountains surround each cluster. The number of clusters can be
		determined by counting valleys on the topographic map. Most
		projection methods are wrappers for already available methods
		in R. By contrast, the neighbor retrieval visualizer (NeRV) is
		based on C++ source code of the 'dredviz' software package, and
		the Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA) is translated from
		'MATLAB' ('SOM Toolbox' 2.0) to R.
