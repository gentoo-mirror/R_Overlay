		A Permutation Based Test for Biomarker Discovery in Microbiome
		Data // The permubiome R package was created to perform a
		permutation-based non-parametric analysis on microbiome data
		for biomarker discovery aims. This test executes thousands of
		comparisons in a pairwise manner, after a random shuffling of
		data into the different groups of study with a prior selection
		of the microbiome features with the largest variation among
		groups. Previous to the permutation test itself, data can be
		normalized according to different methods proposed to handle
		microbiome data ('proportions' or 'Anders'). The median-based
		differences between groups resulting from the multiple
		simulations are fitted to a normal distribution with the aim to
		calculate their significance. A multiple testing correction
		based on Benjamini-Hochberg method (fdr) is finally applied to
		extract the differentially presented features between groups of
		your dataset. LATEST UPDATES: v1.1 and olders incorporates
		function to parse COLUMN format; v1.2 and olders incorporates
		-optimize- function to maximize evaluation of features with
		largest inter-class variation; v1.3 and olders includes the
		-size.effect- function to perform estimation statistics using
		the bootstrap-coupled approach implemented in the 'dabestr' R
		package.
