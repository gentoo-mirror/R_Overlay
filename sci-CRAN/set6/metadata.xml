		R6 Mathematical Sets Interface // An object-oriented package for
		mathematical sets, upgrading the current gold-standard {sets}.
		Many forms of mathematical sets are implemented, including
		(countably finite) sets, tuples, intervals (countably infinite
		or uncountable), and fuzzy variants. Wrappers extend
		functionality by allowing symbolic representations of complex
		operations on sets, including unions, (cartesian) products,
		exponentiation, and differences (asymmetric and symmetric).
