		Cluster High Dimensional Categorical Datasets // Scalable
		Bayesian clustering of categorical datasets. The package
		implements a hierarchical Dirichlet (Process) mixture  of
		multinomial distributions. It is thus a probabilistic latent
		class model (LCM) and can be used to reduce the  dimensionality
		of hierarchical data and cluster individuals into latent
		classes. It can automatically infer an appropriate number of
		latent classes or find k classes, as defined by the user.  The
		model is based on a paper by Dunson and Xing (2009)
		doi:10.1198/jasa.2009.tm08439, but implements a scalable
		variational inference algorithm so that it is applicable to
		large datasets. It is described and tested in the accompanying
		paper by Ahlmann-Eltze and Yau (2018)
		doi:10.1109/DSAA.2018.00068.
