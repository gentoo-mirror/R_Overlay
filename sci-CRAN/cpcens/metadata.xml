		Changepoint Analysis using Censored Time Series Data // To detect
		the changepoint, this package uses most recent changepoint,
		double cumulative sum binary segmentation, multiple
		changepoints in multivariate time series, analyzing each series
		in the panel independently, and analyzing aggregated data
		methods. This package is useful to simulate censored time
		series to detect the most recent changepoint in censored panel
		data as well as to assess prediction accuracy.
