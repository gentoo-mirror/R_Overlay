		Pattern Causality Algorithm // The model proposes a robust
		methodology for detecting and reconstructing the hidden
		structure of dynamic complex systems through short-term
		forecasts and information embedded in reconstructed state
		spaces. The approach not only identifies critical components
		and causal interactions within these systems but also provides
		a practical tool for optimizing system performance and
		stability.
