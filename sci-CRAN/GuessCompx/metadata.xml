		Empirically Estimates Algorithm Complexity // Make an empirical
		guess on the time and memory complexities of an algorithm or a
		function. Tests multiple, increasing size random samples of
		your data and tries to fit various complexity functions o(n),
		o(n2), o(log(n)), etc. Based on best fit, it predicts the full
		computation time on your whole dataset. Results are plotted
		with 'ggplot2'.
