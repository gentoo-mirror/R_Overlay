		Organic Carbon and Plant Available Nutrient Contents in Soil //
		Testing of soil for the contents of organic carbon, and
		available macro- and micro-nutrients is a crucial part of soil
		fertility assessment. This package computes some routinely
		tested soil properties viz. organic carbon (C), total nitrogen
		(N), available N, mineral N, available phosphorus (P),
		available potassium (K), available iron (Fe), available zinc
		(Zn), available manganese (Mn), available copper (Cu), and
		available nickel (Ni) in soil based on laboratory analysis data
		obtained by most commonly followed protocols. Besides, it can
		also draw standard curves based on absorption/emission vs.
		concentration data, and give out unknown concentrations from
		absorption/emission readings.
