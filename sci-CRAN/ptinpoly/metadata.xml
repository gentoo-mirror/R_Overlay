		Point-in-Polyhedron Test (2D and 3D) // Function pip3d() tests
		whether a point in 3D space is within, exactly on, or outside
		an enclosed surface defined by a triangular mesh. Function
		pip2d() tests whether a point in 2D space is within, exactly
		on, or outside a polygon. For a reference, see: Liu et al., A
		new point containment test algorithm based on preprocessing and
		determining triangles, Computer-Aided Design 42(12):1143-1150.
