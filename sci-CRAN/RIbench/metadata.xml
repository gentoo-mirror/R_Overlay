		Benchmark Suite for Indirect Methods for RI Estimation // The
		provided benchmark suite enables the automated evaluation and
		comparison of any existing and novel indirect method for
		reference interval ('RI') estimation in a systematic way.
		Indirect methods take routine measurements of diagnostic tests,
		containing pathological and non-pathological samples as input
		and use sophisticated statistical methods to derive a model
		describing the distribution of the non-pathological samples,
		which can then be used to derive reference intervals. The
		benchmark suite contains 5,760 simulated test sets with varying
		difficulty. To include any indirect method, a custom wrapper
		function needs to be provided. The package offers functions for
		generating the test sets, executing the indirect method and
		evaluating the results. See ?RIbench or
		vignette("RIbench_package") for a more comprehensive
		description of the features. A detailed description and
		application is described in Ammer T., Schuetzenmeister A.,
		Prokosch H.-U., Zierk J., Rank C.M., Rauh M. "RIbench: A
		Proposed Benchmark for the Standardized Evaluation of Indirect
		Methods for Reference Interval Estimation". Clinical Chemistry
		(2022) doi:10.1093/clinchem/hvac142.
