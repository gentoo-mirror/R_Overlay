		Simulation of Piecewise Linear Fuzzy Numbers // The definition of
		fuzzy random variable and the methods of simulation from fuzzy
		random variables are two challenging statistical problems in
		three recent decades. This package is organized based on a
		special definition of fuzzy random variable and simulate fuzzy
		random variable by Piecewise Linear Fuzzy Numbers (PLFNs); see
		Coroianua et al. (2013) doi:10.1016/j.fss.2013.02.005 for
		details about PLFNs. Some important statistical functions are
		considered for obtaining the membership function of main
		statistics, such as mean, variance, summation, standard
		deviation and coefficient of variance. Some of applied
		advantages of 'Sim.PLFN' package are:  (1) Easily generating /
		simulation a random sample of PLFN, (2) drawing the membership
		functions of the simulated PLFNs or the membership function of
		the statistical result, and (3) Considering the simulated PLFNs
		for arithmetic operation or importing into some statistical
		computation. Finally, it must be mentioned that 'Sim.PLFN'
		package works on the basis of 'FuzzyNumbers' package.
