		A Bias Bound Approach to Non-Parametric Inference // A novel
		bias-bound approach for non-parametric inference is introduced,
		focusing on both density and conditional expectation
		estimation. It constructs valid confidence intervals that
		account for the presence of a non-negligible bias and thus make
		it possible to perform inference with optimal mean squared
		error minimizing bandwidths. This package is based on Schennach
		(2020) doi:10.1093/restud/rdz065.
