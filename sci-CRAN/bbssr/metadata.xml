		Blinded Sample Size Re-Estimation for Binary Endpoints //
		Provides comprehensive tools for blinded sample size re-
		estimation (BSSR) in two-arm clinical trials with binary
		endpoints. Unlike traditional fixed-sample designs, BSSR allows
		adaptive sample size adjustments during trials while
		maintaining statistical integrity and study blinding.
		Implements five exact statistical tests: Pearson chi-squared,
		Fisher exact, Fisher mid-p, Z-pooled exact unconditional, and
		Boschloo exact unconditional tests. Supports restricted,
		unrestricted, and weighted BSSR approaches with exact Type I
		error control. Statistical methods based on Mehrotra et al.
