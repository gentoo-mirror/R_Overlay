		Diagnosis of Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Fatty Liver Disease
		// The latest guidelines proposed by International Expert
		Consensus are used for the clinical diagnosis of Metabolic
		Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD). The new definition
		takes hepatic steatosis (determined by elastography or
		histology or biomarker-based fatty liver index) as a major
		criterion. In addition, race, gender, body mass index (BMI),
		waist circumference (WC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG),
		systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP),
		triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
		(HDLC), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance
		(HOMAIR), high sensitive c-reactive protein (HsCRP) for the
		diagnosis of MAFLD. Each parameter has to be interpreted based
		on the proposed cut-offs, making the diagnosis slightly complex
		and error-prone. This package is developed by incorporating the
		latest international expert consensus guidelines, and it will
		aid in the easy and quick diagnosis of MAFLD based on FibroScan
		in busy healthcare settings and also for research purposes. The
		new definition for MAFLD as per the International Consensus
		Statement is described by Eslam M et al (2020).
