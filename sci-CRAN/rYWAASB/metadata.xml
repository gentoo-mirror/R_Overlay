		Simultaneous Selection of Trait and WAASB Index // Proposes a new
		ranking algorithm that utilizes a "Y*WAASB" biplot generated
		from the 'metan' package. The aim of the package is to
		effectively distinguish the top-ranked genotypes. For a
		detailed explanation of the process of obtaining a "Y*WAASB"
		biplot and the related data, please refer to the manual
		included in this package as well as the study by Olivoto  Lcio
		(2020) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13384. In this context, "WAASB"
		refers to the "Weighted Average of Absolute Scores" provided by
		Olivoto et al. (2019) doi:10.2134/agronj2019.03.0220, which
		quantifies the stability of genotypes across different
		environments using linear mixed-effect models. In order to run
		the package, it is necessary to extract the "WAASB"
		coefficients using the 'metan' package.
