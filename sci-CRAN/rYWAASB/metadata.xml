		Simultaneous Selection by Trait and WAASB Index // This tool
		proposes a new ranking algorithm that utilizes a "Y*WAASB"
		biplot generated by the 'metan'. The aim of the current package
		is to effectively distinguish the top-ranked genotypes in MET
		(Multi-Environmental Trials). For a detailed explanation of the
		process of obtaining "WAASB", "WAASBY" indices, and a "Y*WAASB"
		biplot, refer to the manual included in this package as well as
		the study by Olivoto  Lcio (2020) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13384.
		In this context, "WAASB" refers to the "Weighted Average of
		Absolute Scores" provided by Olivoto et al. (2019)
		doi:10.2134/agronj2019.03.0220, which quantifies the stability
		of genotypes across different environments using linear mixed-
		effect models. To run the package, you need to extract the
		"WAASB" and "WAASBY" coefficients using the 'metan' and apply
		them. This tool utilizes PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and
		differentiates the entries which may be genotypes, hybrids,
		varieties, etc using "WAASB", "WAASBY", and a combination of
		the specified trait and WAASB index.
