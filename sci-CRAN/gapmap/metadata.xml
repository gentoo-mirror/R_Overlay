		Drawing Gapped Cluster Heatmap with 'ggplot2' // The gap encodes
		the distance between clusters and improves interpretation of
		cluster heatmaps. The gaps can be of the same distance based on
		a height threshold to cut the dendrogram. Another option is to
		vary the size of gaps based on the distance between clusters.
