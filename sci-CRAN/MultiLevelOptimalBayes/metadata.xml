		Regularized Bayesian Estimator for Two-Level Latent Variable
		Models // Implements a regularized Bayesian estimator that
		optimizes the estimation of between-group coefficients for
		multilevel latent variable models by minimizing mean squared
		error (MSE) and balancing variance and bias. The package
		provides more reliable estimates in scenarios with limited
		data, offering a robust solution for accurate parameter
		estimation in two-level latent variable models. It is designed
		for researchers in psychology, education, and related fields
		who face challenges in estimating between-group effects under
		small sample sizes and low intraclass correlation coefficients.
		The package includes comprehensive S3 methods for result
		objects: print(), summary(), coef(), se(), vcov(), confint(),
		as.data.frame(), dim(), length(), names(), and update() for
		enhanced usability and integration with standard R workflows.
		Dashuk et al. (2024) doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.18148.39048 derived
		the optimal regularized Bayesian estimator; Dashuk et al.
		(2024) doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.34350.01604 extended it to the
		multivariate case; and Luedtke et al. (2008)
		doi:10.1037/a0012869 formalized the two-level latent variable
		framework.
