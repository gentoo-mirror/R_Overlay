		Bessel and Beta Regressions via Expectation-Maximization
		Algorithm for Continuous Bounded Data // Functions to fit, via
		Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the Bessel and Beta
		regressions to a data set with a bounded continuous response
		variable. The Bessel regression is a new and robust approach
		proposed in the literature. The EM version for the well known
		Beta regression is another major contribution of this package.
