		Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average
		Model // Methods and tools for forecasting univariate time
		series using the NARFIMA (Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally
		Integrated Moving Average) model. It combines neural networks
		with fractional differencing to capture both nonlinear patterns
		and long-term dependencies. The NARFIMA model supports seasonal
		adjustment, Box-Cox transformations, optional exogenous
		variables, and the computation of prediction intervals. In
		addition to the NARFIMA model, this package provides
		alternative forecasting models including NARIMA (Neural ARIMA),
		NBSTS (Neural Bayesian Structural Time Series), and NNaive
		(Neural Naive) for performance comparison across different
		modeling approaches. The methods are based on algorithms
		introduced by Chakraborty et al. (2025)
