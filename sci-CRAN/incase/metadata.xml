		Pipe-Friendly Vector Replacement with Case Statements // Offers a
		pipe-friendly alternative to the 'dplyr' functions case_when()
		and if_else().  These functions accept a vector as an optional
		first argument, allowing conditional statements to be built
		using the 'magrittr' dot operator.  The functions also coerce
		all possible outputs to the same type, meaning you no longer
		have to worry about using specific typed variants of NA or
		explicitly declaring integer outputs.
