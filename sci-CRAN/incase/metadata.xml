		Pipe-Friendly Vector Replacement with Case Statements // Offers a
		pipe-friendly alternative to the 'dplyr' functions case_when()
		and if_else(), as well as a number of user-friendly
		simplifications for common use cases.  These functions accept a
		vector as an optional first argument, allowing conditional
		statements to be built using the 'magrittr' dot operator.  The
		functions also coerce all outputs to the same type, meaning you
		no longer have to worry about using specific typed variants of
		NA or explicitly declaring integer outputs, and evaluate
		outputs somewhat lazily, so you don't waste time on long
		operations that won't be used.
