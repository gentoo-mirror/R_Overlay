		Selenium Plugin to Manage Multi Level Shadow Elements on Web Page
		// Shadow Document Object Model is a web standard that offers
		component style and markup encapsulation. It is a critically
		important piece of the Web Components story as it ensures that
		a component will work in any environment even if other CSS or
		JavaScript is at play on the page. Custom HTML tags can't be
		directly identified with selenium tools, because Selenium
		doesn't provide any way to deal with shadow elements. Using
		this plugin you can handle any custom HTML tags.
