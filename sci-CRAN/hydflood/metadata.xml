		Flood Extents and Duration along the Rivers Elbe and Rhine //
		Raster based flood modelling internally using 'hyd1d', an R
		package to interpolate 1d water level and gauging data. The
		package computes flood extent and duration through strategies
		originally developed for 'INFORM', an 'ArcGIS'-based hydro-
		ecological modelling framework. It does not provide a full,
		physical hydraulic modelling algorithm, but a simplified, near
		real time 'GIS' approach for flood extent and duration
		modelling. Computationally demanding annual flood durations
		have been computed already and data products were published by
		Weber (2022) doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.948042.
