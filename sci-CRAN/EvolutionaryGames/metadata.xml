		game theory applies game theory to evolving populations in
		biology, see e.g. one of the books by Weibull (1994,
		ISBN:978-0262731218) or by Sandholm (2010, ISBN:978-0262195874)
		for more details. A comprehensive set of tools to illustrate
		the core concepts of evolutionary game theory, such as
		evolutionary stability or various evolutionary dynamics, for
