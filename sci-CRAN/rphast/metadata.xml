		Interface to 'PHAST' Software for Comparative Genomics //
		Provides an R interface to the
		'PHAST'(http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/) software (Phylogenetic
		Analysis with Space/Time Models).  It can be used for many
		types of analysis in comparative and evolutionary genomics,
		such as estimating models of evolution from sequence data,
		scoring alignments for conservation or acceleration, and
		predicting elements based on conservation or custom
		phylogenetic hidden Markov models.  It can also perform many
		basic operations on multiple sequence alignments and
		phylogenetic trees.
