		Interface to PHAST Software for Comparative Genomics // RPHAST is
		an R interface to the PHAST software (Phylogenetic Analysis
		with Space/Time Models).  It can be used for many types of
		analysis in comparative and evolutionary genomics, such as
		estimating models of evolution from sequence data, scoring
		alignments for conservation or acceleration, and predicting
		elements based on conservation or custom phylogenetic hidden
		Markov models.  It can also perform many basic operations on
		multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.
