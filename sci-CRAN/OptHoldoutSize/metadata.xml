		Estimation of Optimal Size for a Holdout Set for Updating a
		Predictive Score // Predictive scores must be updated with
		care, because actions taken on the basis of existing risk
		scores causes bias in risk estimates from the updated score. A
		holdout set is a straightforward way to manage this problem: a
		proportion of the population is 'held-out' from computation of
		the previous risk score. This package provides tools to
		estimate a size for this holdout set and associated errors.
		Comprehensive vignettes are included. Please see: Haidar-Wehbe
		S, Emerson SR, Aslett LJM, Liley J (2022) arXiv:2202.06374 for
		details of methods.
