		Distance-Sampling Analyses for Density and Abundance Estimation
		// Distance-sampling is a popular method for estimating density
		and abundance of organisms in ecology. Rdistance contains
		routines that assist with analysis of distance-sampling data
		collected on point or line transects. Distance models are
		specified using regression-like formula (similar to lm, glm,
		etc.). Abundance routines perform automated bootstrapping and
		automated detection-function selection. Overall (study area)
		and site-level (transect or point) abundance estimates are
		available. A large suite of classical, parametric detection
		functions are included along with some uncommon parametric
		functions (e.g., Gamma, negative exponential) and non-
		parametric smoothed distance functions. Custom (user-defined)
		detection functions are easily implemented (see vignette). The
		help files and vignettes have been vetted by multiple authors
		and tested in workshop settings.
