		Analyses for Distance-Sampling and Abundance Estimation //
		Distance-sampling is a popular method for abundance estimation
		in ecology. This package contains functions and associated
		routines to analyze distance-sampling data collected on point
		or line transects. It accommodates line and point transect
		analyses in one routine that accepts a regression-like formula
		object. Abundance routines perform automated bootstrapping and
		automated detection-function selection. Overall (study area)
		and site-level (transect or point) abundance estimates are
		available. A large suite of classical, parametric detection
		functions are included.  Some uncommon (e.g., Gamma, negative
		exponential) detection functions are also included and users
		can define their own custom detection functions if needed. One
		form of non-parametric smoothed distance function is included.
		The help files and vignettes have been vetted by multiple
		authors and tested in multiple workshop settings.
