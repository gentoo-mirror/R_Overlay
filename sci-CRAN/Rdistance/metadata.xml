		Distance-Sampling Analyses for Density and Abundance Estimation
		// Distance-sampling analyses estimate density and abundance of
		organisms in ecology when detection probability declines with
		increasing distance from the observers. Distance-sampling is
		popular in most branches of ecology and especially when
		organisms are observed from aerial platforms (e.g., airplane or
		drone), surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along walking
		transects. Rdistance analyzes data collected on both point and
		line transects, estimates overall (study area) and site-level
		(transect or point) density, and allows users to specify
		regression-like formula (similar to lm or glm) for covariates.
		A large suite of classical, parametric detection functions are
		included along with some uncommon parametric functions (e.g.,
		Gamma, negative exponential) and non-parametric smoothed
		distance functions. Custom (user-defined) detection functions
		can be implemented (see vignette).  Measurement unit integrity
		is enforced with internal unit conversion when necessary. The
		help files and vignettes have been vetted by multiple authors
		and tested in workshop settings.
