		Density and Abundance from Distance-Sampling Surveys // Distance-
		sampling (doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19219-2) estimates density and
		abundance of survey targets (e.g., animals) when detection
		probability declines with distance. Distance-sampling is
		popular in ecology, especially when survey targets are observed
		from aerial platforms (e.g., airplane or drone), surface
		vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along walking transects.
		Distance-sampling includes line-transect studies that measure
		observation distances as the closest approach of the sample
		route (transect) to the target (i.e., perpendicular off-
		transect distance), and point-transect studies that measure
		observation distances from stationary observers to the target
		(i.e., radial distance). The routines included here fit smooth
		(parametric) curves to histograms of observation distances and
		use those functions to compute effective sampling distances,
		density of targets in the surveyed area, and abundance of
		targets in a surrounding study area. Curve shapes include the
		half-normal, hazard rate, and negative exponential functions.
		Physical measurement units are required and used throughout to
		ensure density is reported correctly. The help files are
		extensive and have been vetted by multiple authors.
