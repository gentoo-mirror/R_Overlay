		Distance-Sampling Analyses for Density and Abundance Estimation
		// Distance-sampling analyses (doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19219-2)
		estimate density and abundance of survey targets (e.g.,
		animals) when detection declines with distance. Distance-
		sampling is popular ecology, especially when survey targets are
		observed from aerial platforms (e.g., airplane or drone),
		surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along walking
		transects. Both point and line transects can be analyzed.
		Outputs include overall (study area) density and abundance,
		effective sampling distances, and model fit statistics. A large
		suite of classical, parametric detection functions (e.g., half-
		normal, hazard rate) is included along with uncommon parametric
		functions (e.g., Gamma, negative exponential). Non-parametric
		smoothed distance functions are included. Measurement unit
		integrity is enforced via internal unit conversion. The help
		files and vignettes have been vetted by multiple authors and
		tested in workshop settings.
