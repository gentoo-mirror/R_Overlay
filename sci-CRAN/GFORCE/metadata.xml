		Clustering and Inference Procedures for High-Dimensional Latent
		Variable Models // A complete suite of computationally
		efficient methods for high dimensional clustering and inference
		problems in G-Latent Models (a type of Latent Variable Gaussian
		graphical model). The main feature is the FORCE (First-Order,
		Certifiable, Efficient) clustering algorithm which is a fast
		solver for a semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation of the
		K-means problem. For certain types of graphical models
		(G-Latent Models), with high probability the algorithm not only
		finds the optimal clustering, but produces a certificate of
		having done so. This certificate, however, is model independent
		and so can also be used to certify data clustering problems.
		The 'GFORCE' package also contains implementations of
		inferential procedures for G-Latent graphical models using
		n-fold cross validation. Also included are native code
		implementations of other popular clustering methods such as
		Lloyd's algorithm with kmeans++ initialization and complete
		linkage hierarchical clustering. The FORCE method is due to
		Eisenach and Liu (2019) arxiv:1806.00530.
