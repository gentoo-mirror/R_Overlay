		Determining the Number of Factors in Exploratory Factor Analysis
		by LSTM // A method for factor retention using a pre-trained
		Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network, which is originally
		developed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)
		doi:10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735, is provided. The sample size of
		the dataset used to train the LSTM model is 1,000,000. Each
		sample is a batch of simulated response data with a specific
		latent factor structure. The eigenvalues of these response data
		will be used as sequential data to train the LSTM. The pre-
		trained LSTM is capable of factor retention for real response
		data with a true latent factor number ranging from 1 to 10,
		that is, determining the number of factors.
