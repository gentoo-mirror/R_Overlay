		A Shiny Application for Automatic Measurements of Tree-Ring
		Widths on Digital Images // Use morphological image processing
		and edge detection algorithms to automatically identify tree-
		ring boundaries on digital images. Tree-ring boundaries are
		determined by the changes of light reflectance from late wood
		to early wood. Two geometric models are provided to calibrate
		the errors resulted from inclined rings. The package provides a
		Shiny-based application, allowing R beginners to easily analyze
		tree-ring images and export ring-width series in standard file
		formats.
