		A Shiny Application for Automatic Measurements of Tree-Ring
		Widths on Digital Images // Use morphological image processing
		and edge detection algorithms to automatically measure tree
		ring widths on digital images. Users can also manually mark
		tree rings on species with complex anatomical structures. The
		arcs of inner-rings and angles of successive inclined ring
		boundaries are used to correct ring-width series. The package
		provides a Shiny-based application, allowing R beginners to
		easily analyze tree ring images and export ring-width series in
		standard file formats.
