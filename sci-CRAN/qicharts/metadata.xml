		Quality Improvement Charts // Functions for making run charts
		[Anhoej, Olesen (2014) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113825] and
		basic Shewhart control charts [Mohammed, Worthington, Woodall
		(2008) doi:10.1136/qshc.2004.012047] for measure and count
		data. The main function, qic(), creates run and control charts
		and has a simple interface with a rich set of options to
		control data analysis and plotting, including options for
		automatic data aggregation by subgroups, easy analysis of
		before-and-after data, exclusion of one or more data points
		from analysis, and splitting charts into sequential time
		periods. Missing values and empty subgroups are handled
		gracefully.
