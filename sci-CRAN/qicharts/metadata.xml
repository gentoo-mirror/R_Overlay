		Quality Improvement Charts // Functions for making run charts and
		basic Shewhart control charts for measure and count data. The
		main function, qic(), creates run and control charts and has a
		simple interface with a rich set of options to control data
		analysis and plotting, including options for automatic data
		aggregation by subgroups, easy analysis of before-and-after
		data, exclusion of one or more data points from analysis, and
		splitting charts into sequential time periods. Missing values
		and empty subgroups are handled gracefully.
