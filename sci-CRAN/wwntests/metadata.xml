		Hypothesis Tests for Functional Time Series // Provides a
		collection of white noise hypothesis tests for functional time
		series and related visualizations. These include tests based on
		the norms of autocovariance operators that are built under both
		strong and weak white noise assumptions. Additionally, tests
		based on the spectral density operator and on principal
		component dimensional reduction are included, which are built
		under strong white noise assumptions. Also, this package
		provides goodness-of-fit tests for functional autoregressive of
		order 1 models. These methods are described in Kokoszka et al.
