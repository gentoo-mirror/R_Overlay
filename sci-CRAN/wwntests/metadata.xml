		Hypothesis Tests for Functional Time Series // Provides an array
		of white noise hypothesis tests for functional data and related
		visualizations. These include tests based on the norms of
		autocovariance operators that are built under both strong and
		weak white noise assumptions. Additionally, tests based on the
		spectral density operator and on principal component
		dimensional reduction are included, which are built under
		strong white noise assumptions. These methods are described in
		Kokoszka et al. (2017) doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2017.08.004,
		Characiejus and Rice (2019) doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2019.01.003,
		and Gabrys and Kokoszka (2007) doi:10.1198/016214507000001111,
		respectively.
