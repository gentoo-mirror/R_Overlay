		Flexible Implementation of a Structural MCMC Sampler for DAGs //
		Flexible implementation of a structural MCMC sampler for
		Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It supports the new edge
		reversal move from Grzegorczyk and Husmeier (2008)
		doi:10.1007/s10994-008-5057-7 and the Markov blanket resampling
		from Su and Borsuk (2016)
		https://jmlr.org/papers/v17/su16a.html. It supports three
		priors: a prior controlling for structure complexity from
		Koivisto and Sood (2004)
		https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v5/koivisto04a.html, an
		uninformative prior and a user-defined prior. The three main
		problems that can be addressed by this R package are selecting
		the most probable structure based on a cache of pre-computed
		scores, controlling for overfitting, and sampling the landscape
		of high scoring structures. It allows us to quantify the
		marginal impact of relationships of interest by marginalizing
		out over structures or nuisance dependencies. Structural MCMC
		seems an elegant and natural way to estimate the true marginal
		impact, so one can determine if it's magnitude is big enough to
		consider as a worthwhile intervention.
