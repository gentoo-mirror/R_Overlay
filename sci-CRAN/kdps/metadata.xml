		Kinship Decouple and Phenotype Selection (KDPS) // A phenotype-
		aware algorithm for resolving cryptic relatedness in genetic
		studies. It removes related individuals based on kinship or
		identity-by-descent (IBD) scores while prioritizing subjects
		with phenotypes of interest. This approach helps maximize the
		retention of informative subjects, particularly for rare or
		valuable traits, and improves statistical power in genetic and
		epidemiological studies. KDPS supports both categorical and
		quantitative phenotypes, composite scoring, and customizable
		pruning strategies using a fuzziness parameter. Benchmark
		results show improved phenotype retention and high
		computational efficiency on large-scale datasets like the UK
		Biobank. Methods used include Manichaikul et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq559 for kinship estimation,
		Purcell et al. (2007) doi:10.1086/519795 for IBD estimation,
		and Bycroft et al. (2018) doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0579-z for UK
		Biobank data reference.
