		Causal Inference and Prediction in Cohort-Based Analyses //
		Numerous functions for cohort-based analyses, either for
		prediction or causal inference. For causal inference, it
		includes Inverse Probability Weighting and G-computation for
		marginal estimation of an exposure effect when confounders are
		expected. We deal with binary outcomes, times-to-events,
		competing events, and multi-state data. For multistate data,
		semi-Markov model with interval censoring may be considered,
		and we propose the possibility to consider the excess of
		mortality related to the disease compared to reference lifetime
		tables. For predictive studies, we propose a set of functions
		to estimate time-dependent receiver operating characteristic
		(ROC) curves with the possible consideration of right-censoring
		times-to-events or the presence of confounders. Finally,
		several functions are available to assess time-dependent ROC
		curves or survival curves from aggregated data.
