		Causal Inference and Prediction in Cohort-Based Analyses // We
		propose numerous functions for cohort-based analyses, either
		for prediction or causal inference. For causal inference, it
		includes Inverse Probability Weighting and G-computation for
		marginal estimation of an exposure effect when confounders are
		expected. We deal with binary outcomes, times-to-events (Le
		Borgne, 2016, doi:10.1002/sim.6777), competing events (Trebern-
		Launay, 2018, doi: 10.1007/s10654-017-0322-3), and multi-state
		data (Gillaizeau, 2018, doi: 10.1002/sim.7550). For multistate
		data, semi-Markov model with interval censoring (Foucher, 2008,
		doi: 10.1177/0962280208093889) may be considered and we propose
		the possibility to consider the excess of mortality related to
		the disease compared to reference lifetime tables (Gillaizeau,
		2017, doi: 10.1177/0962280215586456). For predictive studies,
		we propose a set of functions to estimate time-dependent
		receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the
		possible consideration of right-censoring times-to-events or
		the presence of confounders (Le Borgne, 2018,  doi:
		10.1177/0962280217702416). Finally, several functions are
		available to assess time-dependant ROC curves (Combescure,
		2017, doi: 10.1177/0962280212464542) or survival curves
		(Combescure, 2014, doi: 10.1002/sim.6111) from aggregated data.
