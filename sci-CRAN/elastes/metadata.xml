		Elastic Full Procrustes Means for Sparse and Irregular Planar
		Curves // Provides functions for the computation of functional
		elastic shape means over sets of open planar curves. The
		package is particularly suitable for settings where these
		curves are only sparsely and irregularly observed. It uses a
		novel approach for elastic shape mean estimation, where planar
		curves are treated as complex functions and a full Procrustes
		mean is estimated from the corresponding smoothed Hermitian
		covariance surface. This is combined with the methods for
		elastic mean estimation proposed in Steyer, Stcker, Greven
		(2022) doi:10.1111/biom.13706. See Stcker et. al. (2022)
		arXiv:2203.10522 for details.
