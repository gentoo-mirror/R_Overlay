		Augmented Backward Elimination // Performs augmented backward
		elimination and checks the stability of the obtained model.
		Augmented backward elimination combines significance or
		information based criteria with the change in estimate to
		either select the optimal model for prediction purposes or to
		serve as a tool to obtain a practically sound, highly
		interpretable model. More details can be found in Dunkler et
		al. (2014) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113677.
