		Fast, Low Memory Footprint Digests of R Objects // Provides an R
		interface to Bob Jenkin's streaming, non-cryptographic
		'SpookyHash' hash algorithm for use in digest-based comparisons
		of R objects. 'fastdigest' plugs directly into R's internal
		serialization machinery, allowing digests of all R objects the
		serialize() function supports, including reference-style
		objects via custom hooks. Speed is high and scales linearly by
		object size; memory usage is constant and negligible.
