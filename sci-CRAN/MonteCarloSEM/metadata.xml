		Monte Carlo Data Simulation Package // Monte Carlo simulation
		allows testing different conditions given to the correct
		structural equation models. This package runs Monte Carlo
		simulations under different conditions (such as sample size or
		normality of data). Within the package data sets can be
		simulated and run based on the given model. First, continuous
		and normal data sets are generated based on the given model.
		Later Fleishman's power method (1978) DOI:10.1007/BF02293811 is
		used to add non-normality if exists. When data generation is
		completed (or when generated data sets are given) model test
		can also be run. Please cite as "Oran, F. (2021).
