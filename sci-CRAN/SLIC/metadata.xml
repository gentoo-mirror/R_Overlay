		LIC for Distributed Skewed Regression // This comprehensive
		toolkit for skewed regression is designated as "SLIC" (The LIC
		for Distributed Skewed Regression Analysis). It is predicated
		on the assumption that the error term follows a skewed
		distribution, such as the Skew-Normal, Skew-t, or Skew-Laplace.
		The methodology and theoretical foundation of the package are
		described in Guo G.(2020) doi:10.1080/02664763.2022.2053949.
