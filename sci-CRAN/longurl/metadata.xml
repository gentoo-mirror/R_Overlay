		Expand Short 'URLs' // Tools are provided to expand vectors of
		short URLs into long 'URLs'. No 'API' services are used, which
		may mean that this operates more slowly than 'API' services do
		(since they usually cache results of expansions that every user
		of the service requests). You can setup your own caching layer
		with the 'memoise' package if you wish to have a speedup during
		single sessions or add larger dependencies, such as 'Redis', to
		gain a longer-term performance boost at the expense of added
		complexity.
