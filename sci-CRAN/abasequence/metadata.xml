		Coding 'ABA' Patterns for Sequence Data // Provides a suite of
		functions for analyzing sequences of events. Users can generate
		and code sequences based on predefined rules, with a special
		focus on the identification of sequences coded as 'ABA' (when
		one element appears, followed by a different one, and then
		followed by the first). Additionally, the package offers the
		ability to calculate the length of consecutive 'ABA'-coded
		sequences sharing common elements. The methods implemented in
		this package are based on the work by Ziembowicz, K.,
		Rychwalska, A.,  Nowak, A. (2022).
