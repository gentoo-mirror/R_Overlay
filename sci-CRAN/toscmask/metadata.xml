		Improved Versions of Base Functions // Operators and functions
		provided by base R sometimes lack some features found in other
		programming languages, such as the ability to concatenate
		strings using + or to repeat strings using *. This package aims
		at providing such functionality without breaking existing code,
		i.e., only statements, that would throw errors in pure base R
		are patched.
