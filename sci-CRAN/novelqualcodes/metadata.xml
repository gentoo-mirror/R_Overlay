		Visualise the Path to a Stopping Point in Qualitative Interviews
		Based on Novel Codes // In semi-structured interviews that use
		the 'framework' method, it is not always clear how refinements
		to interview questions affect the decision of when to stop
		interviews. The trend of 'novel' and 'duplicate' interview
		codes (novel codes are information that other interviewees have
		not previously mentioned) provides insight into the richness of
		qualitative information. This package provides tools to
		visualise when refinements occur and how that affects the
		trends of novel and duplicate codes. These visualisations, when
		used progressively as new interviews are finished, can help the
		researcher to decide on a stopping point for their interviews.
