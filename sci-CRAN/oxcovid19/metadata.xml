		An R API to the Oxford COVID-19 Database // The OxCOVID19 Project
		https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk aims to increase our understanding
		of the COVID-19 pandemic and elaborate possible strategies to
		reduce the impact on the society through the combined power of
		statistical, mathematical modelling, and machine learning
		techniques. The OxCOVID19 Database is a large, single-centre,
		multimodal relational database consisting of information (using
		acknowledged sources) related to COVID-19 pandemic. This
		package provides an R-specific interface to the OxCOVID19
		Database based on widely-used data handling and manipulation
		approaches in R.
