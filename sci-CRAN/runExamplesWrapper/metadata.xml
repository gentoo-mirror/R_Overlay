		Wrapper for 'run_examples()' // Captures errors encountered when
		running 'run_examples()', and processes and archives them. The
		function 'run_examples()' within the 'devtools' package allows
		batch execution of all of the examples within a given package.
		This is much more convenient than testing each example
		manually. However, a major inconvenience is that if an error is
		encountered, the program stops and does not complete testing
		the remaining examples. Also, there is not a systematic record
		of the results, namely which package functions had no examples,
		which had examples that failed, and which had examples that
		succeeded. The current package provides the missing
		functionality.
