		Preprocessing Pupil Size Data // Pupillometric data collected
		using SR Research Eyelink eye trackers requires significant
		preprocessing. This package contains functions for preparing
		pupil dilation data for visualization and statistical analysis.
		Specifically, it provides a pipeline of functions which aid in
		data validation, the removal of blinks/artifacts, downsampling,
		and baselining, among others. Additionally, plotting functions
		for creating grand average and conditional average plots are
		provided. See the vignette for samples of the functionality.
		The package is designed for handling data collected with SR
		Research Eyelink eye trackers using Sample Reports created in
		SR Research Data Viewer.
