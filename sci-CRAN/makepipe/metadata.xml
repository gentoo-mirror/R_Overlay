		Pipeline Tools Inspired by 'GNU Make' // A suite of tools for
		transforming an existing workflow into a self-documenting
		pipeline with very minimal upfront costs. Segments of the
		pipeline are specified in much the same way a 'Make' rule is,
		by declaring an executable recipe (which might be an R script),
		along with the corresponding targets and dependencies. When the
		entire pipeline is run through, only those recipes that need to
		be executed will be. Meanwhile, execution metadata is captured
		behind the scenes for later inspection.
