		File System Cache // Manages a file system cache. Regular files
		can be moved or copied to the cache folder. Sub-folders can be
		created in order to organize the files. Files can be located
		inside the cache using a glob function. Text contents can be
		easily stored in and retrieved from the cache using dedicated
		functions. It can be used for an application or a package, as a
		global cache, or as a per-user cache, in which case the
		standard OS user cache folder will be used (e.g.: on Linux
		$HOME/.cache/R/my_app_or_pkg_cache_folder).
