		Fitting Markov-Modulated Linear Regression Models // A set of
		tools for fitting Markov-modulated linear regression, where
		responses Y(t) are time-additive, and model operates in the
		external environment, which is described as a continuous time
		Markov chain with finite state space. Model is proposed by
		Alexander Andronov (2012) arXiv:1901.09600v1 and algorithm of
		parameters estimation is based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors
		decomposition. Also, package will provide a set of data
		simulation tools for Markov-modulated linear regression (for
		academical/research purposes). Research project No.
		1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/075.
