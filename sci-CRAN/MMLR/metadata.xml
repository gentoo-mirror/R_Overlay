		Fitting Markov-Modulated Linear Regression Models // A set of
		tools for fitting Markov-modulated linear regression, where
		responses Y(t) are time-additive, and model operates in the
		external environment, which is described as a continuous time
		Markov chain with finite state space. Model is proposed by
		Alexander Andronov (2012) arXiv:1901.09600v1 and algorithm of
		parameters estimation is based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors
		decomposition. Markov-switching regression models have the same
		idea of varying the regression parameters randomly in
		accordance with external environment. The difference is that
		for Markov-modulated linear regression model the external
		environment is described as a continuous-time homogeneous
		irreducible Markov chain with known parameters while switching
		models consider Markov chain as unobserved and estimation
		procedure involves estimation of transition matrix. These
		models have significant differences in terms of the analytical
		approach. Also, package provides a set of data simulation tools
		for Markov-modulated linear regression (for academical/research
		purposes). Research project No. 1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/075.
