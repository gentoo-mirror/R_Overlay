		Variant Effect Calibration to ACMG/AMP Evidence Strength //
		Provides a function to calibrate variant effect scores against
		evidence strength categories defined by the American College of
		Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for
		Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines. The method computes
		likelihood ratios of pathogenicity via kernel density
		estimation of pathogenic and benign score distributions, and
		derives score intervals corresponding to ACMG/AMP evidence
		levels. This enables researchers and clinical geneticists to
		interpret functional and computational variant scores in a
		reproducible and standardised manner. For details, see Badonyi
		and Marsh (2025) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf503.
