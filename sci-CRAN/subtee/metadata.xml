		Subgroup Treatment Effect Estimation in Clinical Trials // Naive
		and adjusted treatment effect estimation for subgroups. Model
		averaging (Bornkamp et.al, 2016 doi:10.1002/pst.1796) and
		bagging (Rosenkranz, 2016 doi:10.1002/bimj.201500147) are
		proposed to address the problem of selection bias in treatment
		effect estimates for subgroups. The package can be used for all
		commonly encountered type of outcomes in clinical trials
		(continuous, binary, survival, count). Additional functions are
		provided to build the subgroup variables to be used and to plot
		the results using forest plots.
