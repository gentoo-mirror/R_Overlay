		A Bayesian Dose-Finding Design using Pharmacokinetics(PK) for
		Phase I Clinical Trials // Statistical methods involving PK
		measures are provided, in the dose allocation process during a
		Phase I clinical trials. These methods enter pharmacokinetics
		(PK) in the dose finding designs in different ways, including
		covariates models, dependent variable or hierarchical models.
		This package provides functions to generate data from several
		scenarios and functions to run simulations which their
		objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
		and to investigate the pharmacokinetics of a drug or a
		combination of drugs.
