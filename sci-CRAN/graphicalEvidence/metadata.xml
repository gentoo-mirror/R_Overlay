		Graphical Evidence // Computes marginal likelihood in Gaussian
		graphical models through a novel telescoping block
		decomposition of the precision matrix which allows estimation
		of model evidence. The top level function used to estimate
		marginal likelihood is called evidence(), which expects the
		prior name, data, and relevant prior specific parameters. This
		package also provides an MCMC prior sampler using the same
		underlying approach, implemented in prior_sampling(), which
		expects a prior name and prior specific parameters. Both
		functions also expect the number of burn-in iterations and the
		number of sampling iterations for the underlying MCMC sampler.
