		Robust Stepwise Split Regularized Regression // Functions to
		perform robust stepwise split regularized regression. The
		approach first uses a robust stepwise algorithm to split the
		variables into the models of an ensemble. An adaptive robust
		regularized estimator is then applied to each subset of
		predictors in the models of an ensemble.
