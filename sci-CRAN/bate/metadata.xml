		Computes Bias-Adjusted Treatment Effect // Compute bounds for the
		treatment effect after adjusting for the presence of omitted
		variables in linear econometric models, according to the method
		of Basu (2022) arXiv:2203.12431. You supply the data, identify
		the outcome and treatment variables and additional regressors.
		The main functions will compute bounds for the bias-adjusted
		treatment effect. Many plot functions allow easy visualization
		of results.
