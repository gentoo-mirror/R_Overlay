		String Functions for Compact R Code // A collection of string
		functions designed for writing compact and expressive R code.
		'yasp' (Yet Another String Package) is simple, fast,
		dependency-free, and written in pure R. The package provides: a
		coherent set of abbreviations for paste() from package 'base'
		with a variety of defaults, such as p() for "paste" and pcc()
		for "paste and collapse with commas"; wrap(), bracket(), and
		others for wrapping a string in flanking characters; unwrap()
		for removing pairs of characters (at any position in a string);
		and sentence() for cleaning whitespace around punctuation and
		capitalization appropriate for prose sentences.
