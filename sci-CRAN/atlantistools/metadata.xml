		Process and Visualise Output from Atlantis Models // Atlantis is
		an end-to-end marine ecosystem modelling framework. It was
		originally developed in Australia by E.A. Fulton, A.D.M. Smith
		and D.C. Smith (2007) and has since been adopted in many marine
		ecosystems around the world (http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au).
		The output of an Atlantis simulation is stored in various file
		formats like .netcdf and .txt and different output structures
		are used for the output variables like e.g. productivity or
		biomass. This package is used to convert the different output
		types to a unified format according to the "tidy-data" approach
		by H. Wickham (2014) DOI:10.18637/jss.v059.i10. Additionally,
		ecological metrics like for example spatial overlap of predator
		and prey or consumption can be calculated and visualised with
		this package. Due to the unified data structure it is very easy
		to share model output with each other and perform model
		comparisons.
