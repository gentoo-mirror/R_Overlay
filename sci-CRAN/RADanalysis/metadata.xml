		Normalization and Analysis of Rank Abundance Distributions //
		Implementation of the MaxRank normalization method, which
		enables standardization of Rank Abundance Distributions (RADs)
		to a specified number of ranks. Rank abundance distributions
		are widely used in biology and ecology to describe species
		abundances, and are mathematically equivalent to complementary
		cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) used in physics,
		linguistics, sociology, and other fields. The method is
		described in Saeedghalati et al. (2017)
