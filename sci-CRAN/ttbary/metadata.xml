		Barycenter Methods for Spatial Point Patterns // Computes a point
		pattern in R^2 or on a graph that is representative of a
		collection of many data patterns. The result is an approximate
		barycenter (also known as Frchet mean or prototype) based on a
		transport-transform metric. Possible choices include Optimal
		SubPattern Assignment (OSPA) and Spike Time metrics. Details
		can be found in Mller, Schuhmacher and Mateu (2019)
