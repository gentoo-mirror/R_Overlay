		Bayesian Inference for Multinomial Models with Inequality
		Constraints // Implements Gibbs sampling and Bayes factors for
		multinomial models with linear inequality constraints on the
		vector of probability parameters. As special cases, the model
		class includes models that predict a linear order of binomial
		probabilities (e.g., p[1]  p[2]  p[3]  .50) and mixture models
		assuming that the parameter vector p must be inside the convex
		hull of a finite number of predicted patterns (i.e., vertices).
		A formal definition of inequality-constrained multinomial
		models and the implemented computational methods is provided
		in: Heck, D.W.,  Davis-Stober, C.P. (2019). Multinomial models
		with linear inequality constraints: Overview and improvements
		of computational methods for Bayesian inference. Journal of
		Mathematical Psychology, 91, 70-87.
		doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2019.03.004. Inequality-constrained
		multinomial models have applications in the area of judgment
		and decision making to fit and test random utility models
		(Regenwetter, M., Dana, J.,  Davis-Stober, C.P. (2011).
		Transitivity of preferences. Psychological Review, 118, 4256,
		doi:10.1037/a0021150) or to perform outcome-based strategy
		classification to select the decision strategy that provides
		the best account for a vector of observed choice frequencies
		(Heck, D.W., Hilbig, B.E.,  Moshagen, M. (2017). From
		information processing to decisions: Formalizing and comparing
		probabilistic choice models. Cognitive Psychology, 96, 2640.
