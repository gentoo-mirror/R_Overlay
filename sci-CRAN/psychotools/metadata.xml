		Psychometric Modeling Infrastructure // Infrastructure for
		psychometric modeling such as data classes (for item response
		data and paired comparisons), basic model fitting functions
		(for Bradley-Terry, Rasch, partial credit, rating scale,
		multinomial processing tree models), extractor functions for
		different types of parameters (item, person, threshold,
		discrimination), unified inference and visualizations, and
		various datasets for illustration. Intended as a common
		lightweight and efficient toolbox for psychometric modeling and
		a common building block for fitting psychometric mixture models
		in package "psychomix" and trees based on psychometric models
		in package "psychotree".
