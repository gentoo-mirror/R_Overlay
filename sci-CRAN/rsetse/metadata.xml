		Strain Elevation Tension Spring Embedding // An R implementation
		for the Strain Elevation and Tension embedding algorithm from
		Bourne (2020) doi:10.1007/s41109-020-00329-4. The package
		embeds graphs and networks using the Strain Elevation and
		Tension embedding (SETSe) algorithm. SETSe represents the
		network as a physical system, where edges are elastic, and
		nodes exert a force either up or down based on node features.
		SETSe positions the nodes vertically such that the tension in
		the edges of a node is equal and opposite to the force it
		exerts for all nodes in the network. The resultant structure
		can then be analysed by looking at the node elevation and the
		edge strain and tension. This algorithm works on weighted and
		unweighted networks as well as networks with or without
		explicit node features.  Edge elasticity can be created from
		existing edge weights or kept as a constant.
