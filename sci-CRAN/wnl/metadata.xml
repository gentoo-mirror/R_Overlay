		Minimization Tool for Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Data
		Analysis // This is a set of minimization tools (maximum
		likelihood estimation and least square fitting) to solve
		examples in the Johan Gabrielsson and Dan Weiner's book
		"Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis - Concepts
		and Applications" 5th ed. (ISBN:9198299107). Examples include
		linear and nonlinear compartmental model, turn-over model,
		single or multiple dosing bolus/infusion/oral models,
		allometry, toxicokinetics, reversible metabolism, in-vitro/in-
		vivo extrapolation, enterohepatic circulation, metabolite
		modeling, Emax model, inhibitory model, tolerance model,
		oscillating response model, enantiomer interaction model,
		effect compartment model, drug-drug interaction model, receptor
		occupancy model, and rebound phenomena model.
