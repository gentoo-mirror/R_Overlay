		Parametric Statistical Modelling and Inference for the 'spatstat'
		Family // Functionality for parametric statistical modelling
		and inference for spatial data, mainly spatial point patterns,
		in the 'spatstat' family of packages. (Excludes analysis of
		spatial data on a linear network, which is covered by the
		separate package 'spatstat.linnet'.) Supports parametric
		modelling, formal statistical inference, and model validation.
		Parametric models include Poisson point processes, Cox point
		processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, Gibbs point
		processes and determinantal point processes. Models can be
		fitted to data using maximum likelihood, maximum
		pseudolikelihood, maximum composite likelihood and the method
		of minimum contrast. Fitted models can be simulated and
		predicted. Formal inference includes hypothesis tests (quadrat
		counting tests, Cressie-Read tests, Clark-Evans test, Berman
		test, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford test, scan test, studentised
		permutation test, segregation test, ANOVA tests of fitted
		models, adjusted composite likelihood ratio test, envelope
		tests, Dao-Genton test, balanced independent two-stage test),
		confidence intervals for parameters, and prediction intervals
		for point counts. Model validation techniques include leverage,
		influence, partial residuals, added variable plots, diagnostic
		plots, pseudoscore residual plots, model compensators and Q-Q
		plots.
