		HIGHT Algorithm // HIGHT(HIGh security and light weigHT)
		algorithm is a block cipher encryption algorithm developed to
		provide confidentiality in computing environments that demand
		low power consumption and lightweight, such as RFID(Radio-
		Frequency Identification) and USN(Ubiquitous Sensor Network),
		or in mobile environments that require low power consumption
		and lightweight, such as smartphones and smart cards.
		Additionally, it is designed with a simple structure that
		enables it to be used with basic arithmetic operations, XOR,
		and circular shifts in 8-bit units. This algorithm was designed
		to consider both safety and efficiency in a very simple
		structure suitable for limited environments, compared to the
		former 128-bit encryption algorithm SEED. In December 2010, it
		became an ISO(International Organization for Standardization)
		standard. The detailed procedure is described in Hong et al.
