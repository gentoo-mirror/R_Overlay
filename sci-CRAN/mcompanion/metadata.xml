		Objects and Methods for Multi-Companion Matrices // Provides a
		class for multi-companion matrices with methods for arithmetic
		and factorization.  A method for generation of multi-companion
		matrices with prespecified spectral properties is provided, as
		well as some utilities for periodically correlated and
		multivariate time series models. See Boshnakov (2002)
