		Spatial Autoregressive Graphical Model // Implements the
		methodological developments found in Hermes, van Heerwaarden,
		and Behrouzi (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.04325, and allows
		for the statistical modeling of asymmetric between-location
		effects, as well as within-location effects using spatial
		autoregressive graphical models. The package allows for the
		generation of spatial weight matrices to capture asymmetric
		effects for strip-type intercropping designs, although it can
		handle any type of spatial data commonly found in other
		sciences.
