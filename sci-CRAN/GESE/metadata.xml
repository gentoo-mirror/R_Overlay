		Gene-Based Segregation Test // Implements the gene-based
		segregation test(GESE) and the weighted GESE test for
		identifying genes with causal variants of large effects for
		family-based sequencing data. The methods are described in
		Qiao, D. Lange, C., Laird, N.M., Won, S., Hersh, C.P., et al.
		(2017). DOI:10.1002/gepi.22037. Gene-based segregation method
		for identifying rare variants for family-based sequencing
		studies. Genet Epidemiol 41(4):309-319. More details can be
