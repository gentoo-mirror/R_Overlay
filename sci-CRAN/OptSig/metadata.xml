		Optimal Level of Significance for Regression and Other
		Statistical Tests // Calculates the optimal level of
		significance based on a decision-theoretic approach. The
		optimal level is chosen so that the expected loss from
		hypothesis testing is minimized. A range of statistical tests
		are covered, including the test for the population mean,
		population proportion, and a linear restriction in a multiple
		regression model. The details are covered in Kim, Jae H. and
		Choi, In, Choosing the Level of Significance: A Decision-
		Theoretic Approach (December 18, 2017), available at SSRN:
		https://ssrn.com/abstract=2652773 or doi:10.2139/ssrn.2652773.
