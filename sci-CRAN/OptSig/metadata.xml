		Optimal Level of Significance for Regression and Other
		Statistical Tests // The optimal level of significance is
		calculated based on a decision-theoretic approach. The optimal
		level is chosen so that the expected loss from hypothesis
		testing is minimized. A range of statistical tests are covered,
		including the test for the population mean, population
		proportion, and a linear restriction in a multiple regression
		model. The details are covered in Kim and Choi (2020)
		doi:10.1111/abac.12172, and Kim (2021)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2020.1750484.
