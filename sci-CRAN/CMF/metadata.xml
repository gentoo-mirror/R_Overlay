		Collective Matrix Factorization // Collective matrix
		factorization (CMF) finds joint low-rank representations for a
		collection of matrices with shared row or column entities. This
		code learns a variational Bayesian approximation for CMF,
		supporting multiple likelihood potentials and missing data,
		while identifying both factors shared by multiple matrices and
		factors private for each matrix. For further details on the
		method see Klami et al. (2014) arXiv:1312.5921. The package can
		also be used to learn Bayesian canonical correlation analysis
		(CCA) and group factor analysis (GFA) models, both of which are
		special cases of CMF. This is likely to be useful for people
		looking for CCA and GFA solutions supporting missing data and
		non-Gaussian likelihoods. See Klami et al. (2013)
		https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/online-papers/klami13a.pdf and
		Virtanen et al. (2012)
		http://proceedings.mlr.press/v22/virtanen12.html for details on
		Bayesian CCA and GFA, respectively.
