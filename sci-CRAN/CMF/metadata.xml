		Collective Matrix Factorization // Collective matrix
		factorization (CMF) finds joint low-rank representations for a
		collection of matrices with shared row or column entities. This
		code learns variational Bayesian approximation for CMF,
		supporting multiple likelihood potentials and missing data,
		while identifying both factors shared by multiple matrices and
		factors private for each matrix.
