		Simulation and Statistical Analysis of Multifractional Processes
		// Simulation of several fractional and multifractional
		processes. Includes Brownian and fractional Brownian motions,
		bridges and Gaussian Haar-based multifractional processes
		(GHBMP). Implements the methods from Ayache, Olenko and
		Samarakoon (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2503.07286 for simulation
		of GHBMP. Estimation of Hurst functions and local fractal
		dimension. Clustering realisations based on the Hurst
		functions. Several functions to estimate and plot geometric
		statistics of the processes and time series. Provides a 'shiny'
		application for interactive use of the functions from the
		package.
