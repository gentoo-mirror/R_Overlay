		Tree Sap Flow Extractor // Performs data assimilation, processing
		and analyses on sap flow data obtained with the thermal
		dissipation method (TDM). The package includes functions for
		gap filling time-series data, detecting outliers, calculating
		data-processing uncertainties and generating uniform data
		output and visualisation. The package is designed to deal with
		large quantities of data and to apply commonly used data-
		processing methods. The functions have been validated on data
		collected from different tree species across the northern
		hemisphere (Peters et al. 2018 doi:10.1111/nph.15241).
