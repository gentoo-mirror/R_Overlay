		Microbe-Metabolite Interactions-Based Metabolic Profiles
		Predictor // Implements a computational framework to predict
		microbial community-based metabolic profiles with 'O2PLS'
		model. It provides procedures of model training and prediction.
		Paired microbiome and metabolome data are needed for modeling,
		and the trained model can be applied to predict metabolites of
		analogous environments using new microbial feature abundances.
