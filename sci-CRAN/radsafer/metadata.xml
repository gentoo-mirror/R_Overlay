		Radiation Safety // Provides functions for radiation safety, also
		known as "radiation protection" and "radiological control". The
		science of radiation protection is called "health physics" and
		its engineering functions are called "radiological
		engineering". Functions in this package cover many of the
		computations needed by radiation safety professionals. Examples
		include: obtaining updated calibration and source check values
		for radiation monitors to account for radioactive decay in a
		reference source, simulating instrument readings to better
		understand measurement uncertainty, correcting instrument
		readings for geometry and ambient atmospheric conditions. Many
		of these functions are described in Johnson and Kirby (2011,
		ISBN-13: 978-1609134198). Utilities are also included for
		developing inputs and processing outputs with radiation
		transport codes, such as MCNP, a general-purpose Monte Carlo
		N-Particle code that can be used for neutron, photon, electron,
		or coupled neutron/photon/electron transport (Werner et. al.
		(2018) doi:10.2172/1419730).
