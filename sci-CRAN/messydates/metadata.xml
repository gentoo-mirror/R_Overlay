		A Flexible Class for Messy Dates // Contains a set of tools for
		constructing and coercing into and from the "mdate" class. This
		date class implements ISO 8601-2:2019(E) and allows regular
		dates to be annotated to express unspecified date components,
		approximate or uncertain date components, date ranges, and sets
		of dates. This is useful for describing and analysing temporal
		information, whether historical or recent, where date precision
		may vary.
