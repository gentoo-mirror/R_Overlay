		Bayesian Model Averaging Library // Bayesian Model Averaging for
		linear models with a wide choice of (customizable) priors.
		Built-in priors include coefficient priors (fixed, hyper-g and
		empirical priors), 5 kinds of model priors, moreover model
		sampling by enumeration or various MCMC approaches. Post-
		processing functions allow for inferring posterior inclusion
		and model probabilities, various moments, coefficient and
		predictive densities. Plotting functions available for
		posterior model size, MCMC convergence, predictive and
		coefficient densities, best models representation, BMA
		comparison. Also includes Bayesian normal-conjugate linear
		model with Zellner's g prior, and assorted methods.
