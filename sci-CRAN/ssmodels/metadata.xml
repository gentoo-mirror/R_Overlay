		Sample Selection Models // In order to facilitate the adjustment
		of the sample selection models existing in the literature, we
		created the 'ssmodels' package. Our package allows the
		adjustment of the classic Heckman model (Heckman (1976),
		Heckman (1979) doi:10.2307/1912352), and the estimation of the
		parameters of this model via the maximum likelihood method and
		two-step method, in addition to the adjustment of the Heckman-t
		models introduced in the literature by Marchenko and Genton
		(2012) doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.656011 and the Heckman-Skew
		model introduced in the literature by Ogundimu and Hutton
		(2016) doi:10.1111/sjos.12171. We also implemented functions to
		adjust the generalized version of the Heckman model, introduced
		by Bastos, Barreto-Souza, and Genton (2021)
		doi:10.5705/ss.202021.0068, that allows the inclusion of
		covariables to the dispersion and correlation parameters, and a
		function to adjust the Heckman-BS model introduced by Bastos
		and Barreto-Souza (2020) doi:10.1080/02664763.2020.1780570 that
		uses the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution as a joint distribution
		of the selection and primary regression variables. This package
		extends and complements existing R packages such as
		'sampleSelection' (Toomet and Henningsen, 2008) and 'ssmrob'
		(Zhelonkin et al., 2016), providing additional robust and
		flexible sample selection models.
