		Ordinary Differential Equation Systems in Ecology // A framework
		to simulate ecosystem dynamics through ordinary differential
		equations (ODEs). You create an ODE model, tells 'ecode' to
		explore its behaviour, and perform numerical simulations on the
		model. 'ecode' also allows you to fit model parameters by
		machine learning algorithms. Potential users include
		researchers who are interested in the dynamics of ecological
		community and biogeochemical cycles.
