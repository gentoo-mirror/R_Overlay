		Creating and Working with Pedigrees and Marker Data // A
		lightweight, but comprehensive collection of tools for
		creating, manipulating and visualising pedigrees and genetic
		marker data. Pedigrees can be read from text files or created
		on the fly with built-in functions. A range of utilities enable
		modifications like adding or removing individuals, breaking
		loops, and merging pedigrees. Pedigree plots are produced by
		wrapping the plotting functionality of the 'kinship2' package.
