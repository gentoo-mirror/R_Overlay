		Optimal Analysis of Test and Rating Scale Data // Develop,
		evaluate, and score multiple choice examinations, psychological
		scales, questionnaires, and similar types of data involving
		sequences of choices among one or more sets of answers. This
		version of the package should be considered as brand new.
		Almost all of the functions have been changed, including their
		argument list. See the file NEWS.Rd in the Inst folder for more
		information. Using the package does not require any formal
		statistical knowledge beyond what would be provided by a first
		course in statistics in a social science department.  There the
		user would encounter the concept of probability and how it is
		used to model data and make decisions, and would become
		familiar with basic mathematical and statistical notation. Most
		of the output is in graphical form.
