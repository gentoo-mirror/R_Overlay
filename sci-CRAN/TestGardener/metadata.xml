		Optimal Analysis of Test and Rating Scale Data // Develop,
		evaluate, and score multiple choice examinations, psychological
		scales, questionnaires, and similar types of data involving
		sequences of choices among one or more sets of answers. Using
		the package does not require any formal statistical knowledge
		beyond what would be provided by a first course in statistics
		in a social science department.  There the user would encounter
		the concept of probability and how it is used to model data and
		make decisions, and would become familiar with basic
		mathematical and statistical notation. The essential aspects of
		each display were designed to be self-explanatory, although
		more statistically sophisticated users will also find
		information that they may find helpful. Most of the output is
		in graphical form. Two recent papers on the methodology are
