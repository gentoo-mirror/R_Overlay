		Partial Linear Single Index Models for Environmental Mixture
		Analysis // Collection of ancillary functions and utilities for
		Partial Linear Single Index Models for Environmental mixture
		analyses, which currently provides functions for scalar
		outcomes. The outputs of these functions include the single
		index function, single index coefficients, partial linear
		coefficients, mixture overall effect, exposure main and
		interaction effects, and differences of quartile effects. In
		the future, we will add functions for binary, ordinal, Poisson,
		survival, and longitudinal outcomes, as well as models for
		time-dependent exposures. See Wang et al (2020)
		doi:10.1186/s12940-020-00644-4 for an overview.
