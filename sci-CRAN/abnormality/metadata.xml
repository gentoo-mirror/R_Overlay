		Measure a Subject's Abnormality with Respect to a Reference
		Population // Contains the functions to implement the
		methodology and considerations laid out by Marks et al. in the
		manuscript Measuring Abnormality in High Dimensional Spaces:
		Applications in Biomechanical Gait Analysis. As of 2/27/2018
		this paper has been submitted and is under scientific review.
		Using high-dimensional datasets to measure a subjects overall
		level of abnormality as compared to a reference population is
		often needed in outcomes research. Utilizing applications in
		instrumented gait analysis, that article demonstrates how using
		data that is inherently non-independent to measure overall
		abnormality may bias results. A methodology is introduced to
		address this bias to accurately measure overall abnormality in
		high dimensional spaces. While this methodology is in line with
		previous literature, it differs in two major ways.
		Advantageously, it can be applied to datasets in which the
		number of observations is less than the number of
		features/variables, and it can be abstracted to practically any
		number of domains or dimensions. After applying the proposed
		methodology to the original data, the researcher is left with a
		set of uncorrelated variables (i.e. principal components) with
		which overall abnormality can be measured without bias.
		Different considerations are discussed in that article in
		deciding the appropriate number of principal components to keep
		and the aggregate distance measure to utilize.
