		Automatize Diagnosis Standardized Assignation Using the Banff
		Classification // Assigns standardized diagnoses using the
		Banff Classification (Category 1 to 6 diagnoses, including
		Acute and Chronic active T-cell mediated rejection as well as
		Active, Chronic active, and Chronic antibody mediated
		rejection). The main function considers a minimal dataset
		containing biopsies information in a specific format (described
		by a data dictionary), verifies its content and format (based
		on the data dictionary), assigns diagnoses, and creates a
		summary report. The package is developed on the reference guide
		to the Banff classification of renal allograft pathology
		Roufosse C, Simmonds N, Clahsen-van Groningen M, et al. A
		(2018) doi:10.1097/TP.0000000000002366. The full description of
		the Banff classification is available at
