		Paleontological and Phylogenetic Analyses of Evolution //
		Provides tools for transforming, a posteriori time-scaling, and
		modifying phylogenies containing extinct (i.e. fossil)
		lineages. In particular, most users are interested in the
		functions timePaleoPhy(), bin_timePaleoPhy(),
		cal3TimePaleoPhy() and bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy(), which date
		cladograms of fossil taxa using stratigraphic data. This
		package also contains a large number of likelihood functions
		for estimating sampling and diversification rates from
		different types of data available from the fossil record (e.g.
		range data, occurrence data, etc). paleotree users can also
		simulate diversification and sampling in the fossil record
		using the function simFossilRecord(), which is a detailed
		simulator for branching birth-death-sampling processes composed
		of discrete taxonomic units arranged in ancestor-descendant
		relationships. Users can use simFossilRecord() to simulate
		diversification in incompletely sampled fossil records, under
		various models of morphological differentiation (i.e. the
		various patterns by which morphotaxa originate from one
		another), and with time-dependent, longevity-dependent and/or
		diversity-dependent rates of diversification, extinction and
		sampling. Additional functions allow users to translate
		simulated ancestor-descendant data from simFossilRecord() into
		standard time-scaled phylogenies or unscaled cladograms that
		reflect the relationships among taxon units.
