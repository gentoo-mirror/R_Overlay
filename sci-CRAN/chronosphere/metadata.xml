		Earth System History Variables // The purpose of the
		'chronosphere' project is to facilitate spatially explicit
		analyses of (paleo)environmental/ecological research. The
		package serves as a gateway to plate tectonic reconstructions,
		deep time global climate model results as well as fossil
		occurrence datasets such as the Paleobiology Database
		https://paleobiodb.org/ and the PaleoReefs Database https://www
		.paleo-reefs.pal.uni-erlangen.de/. Environmental data stored on
		a remote server can be downloaded and imported directly to the
		R environment. Query functions to the GPlates
		https://www.gplates.org/ desktop application or the GPlates Web
		Service https://gws.gplates.org/ allow users to reconstruct
		coordinates, static plates, and Spatial objects. A wrapper
		class 'RasterArray' is implemented around the 'RasterLayer'
		class, allowing the organization of spatially explicit raster
		data in n-dimensional arrays. The project is developed under
		the umbrella of the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)
		Research Unit TERSANE2 (For 2332, TEmperature Related Stressors
		in ANcient Extinctions).
