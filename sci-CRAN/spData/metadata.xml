		Datasets for Spatial Analysis // Diverse spatial datasets for
		demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching spatial data analysis.
		It includes R data of class sf (defined by the package 'sf'),
		Spatial (sp), and nb (spdep). Unlike other spatial data
		packages such as 'rnaturalearth' and 'maps', it also contains
		data stored in a range of file formats including GeoJSON, ESRI
		Shapefile and GeoPackage. Some of the datasets are designed to
		illustrate specific analysis techniques. cycle_hire and
		cycle_hire_osm, for example, is designed to illustrate point
		pattern analysis techniques. This package interacts with data
		available through the 'spDataLarge' package, which is available
		in a 'drat' repository. To access this data package, run
		'install.packages("spDataLarge", repos =
		"https://nowosad.github.io/drat/", type = "source")'. The size
		of the 'spDataLarge' package is approximately 12 MB.
