		Datasets for Spatial Analysis // Diverse spatial datasets for
		demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching spatial data analysis.
		It includes R data of class sf (defined by the package 'sf'),
		Spatial ('sp'), and nb ('spdep'). Unlike other spatial data
		packages such as 'rnaturalearth' and 'maps', it also contains
		data stored in a range of file formats including GeoJSON and
		GeoPackage, but from version 2.3.4, no longer ESRI Shapefile -
		use GeoPackage instead. Some of the datasets are designed to
		illustrate specific analysis techniques. cycle_hire() and
		cycle_hire_osm(), for example, is designed to illustrate point
		pattern analysis techniques.
