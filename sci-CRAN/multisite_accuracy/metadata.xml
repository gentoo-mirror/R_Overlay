		Estimation of Accuracy in Multisite Machine-Learning Models //
		The effects of the site may severely bias the accuracy of a
		multisite machine-learning model, even if the analysts removed
		them when fitting the model in the 'training set' and when
		applying the model in the 'test set'. This simple R package
		estimates the accuracy of a multisite machine-learning model
		unbiasedly as described in (Solanes et al, Psychiatry Research:
		Neuroimaging 2021, in Press). It currently supports the
		estimation of sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, the
		area under the curve, correlation, mean squarer error, and
		hazard ratio for binomial, gaussian, and survival (time-to-
		event) outcomes.
