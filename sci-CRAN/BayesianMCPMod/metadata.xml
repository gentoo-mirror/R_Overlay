		Simulate, Evaluate, and Analyze Dose Finding Trials with Bayesian
		MCPMod // Bayesian MCPMod (Fleischer et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1002/pst.2193) is an innovative method that improves the
		traditional MCPMod by systematically incorporating historical
		data, such as previous placebo group data. This R package
		offers functions for simulating, analyzing, and evaluating
		Bayesian MCPMod trials with normally distributed endpoints.  It
		enables the assessment of trial designs incorporating
		historical data across various true dose-response relationships
		and sample sizes. Robust mixture prior distributions, such as
		those derived with the Meta-Analytic-Predictive approach
		(Schmidli et al. (2014) doi:10.1111/biom.12242), can be
		specified for each dose group.  Resulting mixture posterior
		distributions are used in the Bayesian Multiple Comparison
		Procedure and modeling steps.  The modeling step also includes
		a weighted model averaging approach (Pinheiro et al. (2014)
		doi:10.1002/sim.6052). Estimated dose-response relationships
		can be bootstrapped and visualized.
