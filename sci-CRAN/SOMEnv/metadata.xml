		SOM Algorithm for the Analysis of Multivariate Environmental Data
		// Analysis of multivariate environmental high frequency data
		by Self-Organizing Map and k-means clustering algorithms. By
		means of the graphical user interface it provides a comfortable
		way to elaborate by self-organizing map algorithm rather big
		datasets (txt files up to 100 MB ) obtained by environmental
		high-frequency monitoring by sensors/instruments. The functions
		present in the package are based on 'kohonen' and 'openair'
		packages implemented by functions embedding Vesanto et al.
		(2001) http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/somtoolbox/package/papers
		/techrep.pdf  heuristic rules for map initialization
		parameters, k-means clustering algorithm and map features
		visualization. Cluster profiles visualization as well as graphs
		dedicated to the visualization of time-dependent variables
