		Diverse Cluster Ensemble in R // Performs cluster analysis using
		an ensemble clustering framework, Chiu  Talhouk (2018)
		doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1996-y.  Results from a diverse set of
		algorithms are pooled together using methods such as majority
		voting, K-Modes, LinkCluE, and CSPA. There are options to
		compare cluster assignments across algorithms using internal
		and external indices, visualizations such as heatmaps, and
		significance testing for the existence of clusters.
