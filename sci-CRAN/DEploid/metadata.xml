		Deconvolute Mixed Genomes with Unknown Proportions // Traditional
		phasing programs are limited to diploid organisms. Our method
		modifies Li and Stephens algorithm with Markov chain Monte
		Carlo (MCMC) approaches, and builds a generic framework that
		allows haplotype searches in a multiple infection setting. This
		package is primarily developed as part of the Pf3k project,
		which is a global collaboration using the latest sequencing
		technologies to provide a high-resolution view of natural
		variation in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
		Parasite DNA are extracted from patient blood sample, which
		often contains more than one parasite strain, with unknown
		proportions. This package is used for deconvoluting mixed
		haplotypes, and reporting the mixture proportions from each
		sample.
