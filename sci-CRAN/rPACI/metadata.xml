		Placido Analysis of Corneal Irregularity // Analysis of corneal
		data obtained from a Placido disk corneal topographer with
		calculation of irregularity indices. This package performs
		analyses of corneal data obtained from a Placido disk corneal
		topographer, with the calculation of the Placido irregularity
		indices and the posterior analysis. The package is intended to
		be easy to use by a practitioner, providing a simple interface
		and yielding easily interpretable results. A corneal
		topographer is an ophthalmic clinical device that obtains
		measurements in the cornea (the anterior part of the eye). A
		Placido disk corneal topographer makes use of the Placido disk
		[Rowsey et al. (1981)]doi:10.1001/archopht.1981.03930011093022,
		which produce a circular pattern of measurement nodes. The raw
		information measured by such a topographer is used by
		practitioners to analyze curvatures, to study optical
		aberrations, or to diagnose specific conditions of the eye
		(e.g. keratoconus, an important corneal disease). The rPACI
		package allows the calculation of the corneal irregularity
		indices described in [Castro-Luna et al.
		(2020)]doi:10.1016%2Fj.clae.2019.12.006, [Ramos-Lopez et al.
		(2013)]doi:10.1097%2FOPX.0b013e3182843f2a, and [Ramos-Lopez et
		al. (2011)]doi:10.1097/opx.0b013e3182279ff8. It provides a
		simple interface to read corneal topography data files as
		exported by a typical Placido disk topographer, to compute the
		irregularity indices mentioned before, and to display summary
		plots that are easy to interpret for a clinician.
