		Placido Analysis of Corneal Irregularity // Analysis of corneal
		data obtained from a Placido disk corneal topographer with
		calculation of irregularity indices. A corneal topographer is
		an ophthalmic clinical device that obtains measurements in the
		cornea (the anterior part of the eye). A Placido disk corneal
		topographer makes use of the Placido disk (Rowsey et al.
		(1981), doi:10.1001/archopht.1981.03930011093022, Rand et al.
		(1997), doi:10.1016/S0886-3350(99)00355-7), which produce a
		circular pattern of measurement nodes. The raw information
		measured by such a topographer is used by practitioners to
		analyze curvatures, to study optical aberrations, or to
		diagnose specific conditions of the eye. The rPACI package
		allows the calculation of the corneal irregularity indices
		described in Ramos-Lopez et al. (2013),
		doi:10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182843f2a, and that were firstly
		introduced in Ramos-Lopez et al. (2011),
		doi:10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182843f2a. It provides a simple
		interface to read corneal topography data files as exported by
		a typical Placido disk topographer, to compute the irregularity
		indices mentioned before, and to display summary plots that are
		easy to interpret for a clinician.
