		Individual R Markdown Templates // Simplifies the generation of
		customized R Markdown PDF templates. A template may include an
		individual logo, typography, geometry or color scheme. The
		package provides a skeleton with detailed instructions for
		customizations. The skeleton can be modified by changing
		defaults in the 'YAML' header, by adding additional 'LaTeX'
		commands or by applying dynamic adjustments in R. Individual
		corporate design elements, such as a title page, can be added
		as R functions that produce 'LaTeX' code.
