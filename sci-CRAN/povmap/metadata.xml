		Extension to the 'emdi' Package // The R package 'povmap'
		supports small area estimation of means and poverty headcount
		rates. It adds several new features to the 'emdi' package (see
		"The R Package emdi for Estimating and Mapping Regionally
		Disaggregated Indicators" by Kreutzmann et al. (2019)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i07). These include new options for
		incorporating survey weights, ex-post benchmarking of
		estimates, two additional transformations, several new
		convenient functions to assist with reporting results, and a
		wrapper function to facilitate access from 'Stata'.
