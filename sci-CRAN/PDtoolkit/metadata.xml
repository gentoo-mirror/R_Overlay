		Collection of Tools for PD Rating Model Development and
		Validation // The goal of this package is to cover the most
		common steps in probability of default (PD) rating model
		development and validation. The main procedures available are
		those that refer to univariate, bivariate, multivariate
		analysis, calibration and validation. Along with accompanied
		'monobin' and 'monobinShiny' packages, 'PDtoolkit' provides
		functions which are suitable for different data transformation
		and modeling tasks such as: imputations, monotonic binning of
		numeric risk factors, binning of categorical risk factors,
		weights of evidence (WoE) and information value (IV)
		calculations, WoE coding (replacement of risk factors
		modalities with WoE values), risk factor clustering, area under
		curve (AUC) calculation and others. Additionally, package
		provides set of validation functions for testing homogeneity,
		heterogeneity, discriminatory and predictive power of the
		model.
