		'DataSHIELD' 'Tidyverse' Clientside Package // Implementation of
		selected 'Tidyverse' functions within 'DataSHIELD', an open-
		source federated analysis solution in R. Currently,
		'DataSHIELD' contains very limited tools for data manipulation,
		so the aim of this package is to improve the researcher
		experience by implementing essential functions for data
		manipulation, including subsetting, filtering, grouping, and
		renaming variables. This is the clientside package which should
		be installed locally, and is used in conjuncture with the
		serverside package 'dsTidyverse' which is installed on the
		remote server holding the data. For more information, see
		https://www.tidyverse.org/, https://datashield.org/ and
		https://github.com/molgenis/ds-tidyverse.
