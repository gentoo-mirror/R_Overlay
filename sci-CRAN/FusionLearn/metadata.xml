		Fusion Learning // The fusion learning method uses a model
		selection algorithm to learn from multiple data sets across
		different experimental platforms through group penalization.
		The responses of interest may include a mix of discrete and
		continuous variables. The responses may share the same set of
		predictors, however, the models and parameters differ across
		different platforms. Integrating information from different
		data sets can enhance the power of model selection. Package is
		based on Xin Gao, Raymond J. Carroll (2017) arXiv:1610.00667v1.
