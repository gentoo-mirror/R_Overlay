		Tests of White Noise using Wavelets // Provides methods to test
		whether time series is consistent with white noise. Two new
		tests based on Haar wavelets and general wavelets described by
		Nason and Savchev (2014) doi:10.1002/sta4.69 are provided and,
		for comparison purposes this package also implements the B test
		of Bartlett (1967) doi:10.2307/2333850. Functionality is
		provided to compute an approximation to the theoretical power
		of the general wavelet test in the case of general ARMA
		alternatives.
