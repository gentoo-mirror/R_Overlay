		Identification and Analysis of ceRNA Regulation // Provides
		several functions to identify and analyse miRNA sponge,
		including popular methods for identifying miRNA sponge
		interactions, two types of global ceRNA regulation prediction
		methods and three types of context-specific prediction methods(
		Li Y et al.(2017) doi:10.1093/bib/bbx137), which are based on
		miRNA-messenger RNA regulation alone, or by integrating
		heterogeneous data, respectively. In addition, this package
		provides several network analysis modules for viewing the
		constructed ceRNA-ceRNA network and analysis of the topological
		features.
