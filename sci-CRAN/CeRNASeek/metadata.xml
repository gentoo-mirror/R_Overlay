		Identification and Analysis of ceRNA Regulation // Provides
		several functions to identify and analyse miRNA sponge,
		including popular methods for identifying miRNA sponge
		interactions, two types of global ceRNA regulation prediction
		methods and four types of context-specific prediction methods(
		Li Y et al.(2017) doi:10.1093/bib/bbx137), which are based on
		miRNA-messenger RNA regulation alone, or by integrating
		heterogeneous data, respectively. In addition, For predictive
		ceRNA relationship pairs, this package provides several
		downstream analysis algorithms, including regulatory network
		analysis and functional annotation analysis, as well as
		survival prognosis analysis based on expression of ceRNA
		ternary pair.
