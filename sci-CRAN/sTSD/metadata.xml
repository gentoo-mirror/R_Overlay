		Simulate Time Series Diagnostics // These are tools that allow
		users to do time series diagnostics, primarily tests of unit
		root, by way of simulation. While there is nothing necessarily
		wrong with the received wisdom of critical values generated
		decades ago, simulation provides its own perks. Not only is
		simulation broadly informative as to what these various test
		statistics do and what are their plausible values, simulation
		provides more flexibility for assessing unit root by way of
		different thresholds or different hypothesized distributions.
