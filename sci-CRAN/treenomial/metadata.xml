		Comparison of Trees using a Tree Defining Polynomial // Provides
		functionality for creation and comparison of polynomials that
		uniquely describe trees as introduced in Liu (2019,
		arXiv:1904.03332). The core method converts rooted unlabeled
		phylo objects from 'ape' to the tree defining polynomials
		described with coefficient matrices. Additionally, a conversion
		for rooted binary trees with binary trait labels is also
		provided. Once the polynomials of trees are calculated there
		are functions to calculate distances, distance matrices and
		plot different distance trees from a target tree. Manipulation
		and conversion to the tree defining polynomials is implemented
		in C++ with 'Rcpp' and 'RcppArmadillo'. Furthermore, parallel
		programming with 'RcppThread' is used to improve performance
		converting to polynomials and calculating distances.
