		Reshape Disorganised Messy Data // Helps the user to build and
		register schema descriptions of disorganised (messy) tables.
		Disorganised tables are tables that are not in a topologically
		coherent form, where packages such as 'tidyr' could be used for
		reshaping. The schema description documents the arrangement of
		input tables and is used to reshape them into a standardised
		(tidy) output format.
