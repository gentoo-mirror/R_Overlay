		Capture-Mark-Recapture Analysis using Multiple Non-Invasive Marks
		// Traditional and spatial capture-mark-recapture analysis with
		multiple non-invasive marks. The models implemented in
		'multimark' combine encounter history data arising from two
		different non-invasive ``marks'', such as images of left-sided
		and right-sided pelage patterns of bilaterally asymmetrical
		species, to estimate abundance and related demographic
		parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. Bayesian
		models are specified using simple formulae and fitted using
		Markov chain Monte Carlo. Addressing deficiencies in currently
		available software, 'multimark' also provides a user-friendly
		interface for performing Bayesian multimodel inference using
		non-spatial or spatial capture-recapture data consisting of a
		single conventional mark or multiple non-invasive marks.
