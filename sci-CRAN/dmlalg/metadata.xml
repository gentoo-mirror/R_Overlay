		Double Machine Learning Algorithms // Implementation of double
		machine learning (DML) algorithms in R, based on Emmenegger and
		Buehlmann (2021) "Regularizing Double Machine Learning in
		Partially Linear Endogenous Models" arXiv:2101.12525 and
		Emmenegger and Buehlmann (2021) arXiv:2108.13657 "Double
		Machine Learning for Partially Linear Mixed-Effects Models with
		Repeated Measurements". First part: our goal is to perform
		inference for the linear parameter in partially linear models
		with confounding variables. The standard DML estimator of the
		linear parameter has a two-stage least squares interpretation,
		which can lead to a large variance and overwide confidence
		intervals. We apply regularization to reduce the variance of
		the estimator, which produces narrower confidence intervals
		that are approximately valid. Nuisance terms can be flexibly
		estimated with machine learning algorithms. Second part: our
		goal is to estimate and perform inference for the linear
		coefficient in a partially linear mixed-effects model with DML.
		Machine learning algorithms allows us to incorporate more
		complex interaction structures and high-dimensional variables.
