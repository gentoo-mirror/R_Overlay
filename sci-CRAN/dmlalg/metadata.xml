		Double Machine Learning Algorithms // Implementation of double
		machine learning (DML) algorithms in R, based on Emmenegger and
		Buehlmann (2021) "Regularizing Double Machine Learning in
		Partially Linear Endogenous Models" arXiv:2101.12525. Our goal
		is to perform inference for the linear parameter in partially
		linear models with confounding variables. The standard DML
		estimator of the linear parameter has a two-stage least squares
		interpretation, which can lead to a large variance and overwide
		confidence intervals. We apply regularization to reduce the
		variance of the estimator, which produces narrower confidence
		intervals that are approximately valid. Nuisance terms can be
		flexibly estimated with machine learning algorithms.
