		Automated Cytometry Gating // Given the hypothesis of a bimodal
		distribution of cells for each marker, the algorithm constructs
		a binary tree, the nodes of which are subpopulations of cells.
		At each node, observed cells and markers are modeled by both a
		family of normal distributions and a family of bimodal normal
		mixture distributions. Splitting is done according to a
		normalized difference of AIC between the two families.
