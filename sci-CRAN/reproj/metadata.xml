		Coordinate System Transformations for Generic Map Data //
		Transform coordinates from a specified source to a specified
		target map projection. This uses the 'PROJ' library directly,
		by wrapping the 'PROJ' package which leverages 'libproj',
		otherwise the 'proj4' package. The 'reproj()' function is
		generic, methods may be added to remove the need for an
		explicit source definition. If 'proj4' is in use 'reproj()'
		handles the requirement for conversion of angular units where
		necessary. This is for use primarily to transform generic data
		formats and direct leverage of the underlying 'PROJ' library.
		(There are transformations that aren't possible with 'PROJ' and
		that are provided by the 'GDAL' library, a limitation which
		users of this package should be aware of.) The 'PROJ' library
		is available at https://proj.org/.
