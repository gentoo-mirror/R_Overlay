		Causal Distillation Trees // Causal Distillation Tree (CDT) is a
		novel machine learning method for estimating interpretable
		subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects. CDT allows
		researchers to fit any machine learning model (or metalearner)
		to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects for each
		individual, and then "distills" these predicted heterogeneous
		treatment effects into interpretable subgroups by fitting an
		ordinary decision tree to predict the previously-estimated
		heterogeneous treatment effects. This package provides tools to
		estimate causal distillation trees (CDT), as detailed in Huang,
		Tang, and Kenney (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2502.07275.
