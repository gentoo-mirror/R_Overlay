		Transmissions and Receptions in a Hop by Hop Network // Computes
		the expectation of the number of transmissions and receptions
		considering a Hop-by-Hop transport model with limited number of
		retransmissions per packet. It provides the theoretical results
		shown in Palma et. al.(2016) DOI:10.1109/TLA.2016.7555237 and
		also estimated values based on Monte Carlo simulations.
