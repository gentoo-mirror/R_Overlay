		High-Dimensional Metrics // Implementation of selected high-
		dimensional statistical and econometric methods for estimation
		and inference. Efficient estimators and  uniformly valid
		confidence intervals for various low-dimensional
		causal/structural parameters are provided which appear in high-
		dimensional approximately sparse models. Including functions
		for fitting heteroscedastic robust Lasso regressions with non-
		Gaussian errors and for instrumental variable (IV) and
		treatment effect estimation in a high-dimensional setting.
		Moreover, the methods enable valid post-selection inference and
		rely on a theoretically grounded, data-driven choice of the
		penalty.
