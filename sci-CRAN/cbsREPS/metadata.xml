		Hedonic and Multilateral Index Methods for Real Estate Price
		Statistics // Compute price indices using various Hedonic and
		multilateral methods, including Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher, and
		HMTS (Hedonic Multilateral Time series re-estimation with
		splicing). The central function calculate_price_index() offers
		a unified interface for running these methods on structured
		datasets. This package is designed to support index
		construction workflows for real estate and other domains where
		quality-adjusted price comparisons over time are essential. The
		development of this package was funded by Eurostat and
		Statistics Netherlands (CBS), and carried out by Statistics
		Netherlands. The HMTS method implemented here is described in
		Ishaak, Ouwehand and Remy (2024) doi:10.1177/0282423X241246617.
		For broader methodological context, see Eurostat (2013,
		ISBN:978-92-79-25984-5, doi:10.2785/34007).
