		Perform Permutation Test on General Linear and Mixed Linear
		Regression // We provide a solution for performing permutation
		tests on linear and mixed linear regression models. It allows
		users to obtain accurate p-values without making distributional
		assumptions about the data. By generating a null distribution
		of the test statistics through repeated permutations of the
		response variable, permutation tests provide a powerful
		alternative to traditional parameter tests (Holt et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s10683-023-09799-6). In this early version, we
		focus on the permutation tests over observed t values of beta
		coefficients, i.e.original t values generated by parameter
		tests. After generating a null distribution of the test
		statistic through repeated permutations of the response
		variable, each observed t values would be compared to the null
		distribution to generate a p-value. To improve the efficiency,a
		stop criterion (Anscombe (1953)
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1953.tb00121.x) is adopted to force
		permutation to stop if the estimated standard deviation of the
		value falls below a fraction of the estimated p-value. By doing
		so, we avoid the need for massive calculations in exact
		permutation methods while still generating stable and accurate
		p-values.
