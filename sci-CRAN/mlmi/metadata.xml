		Maximum Likelihood Multiple Imputation // Implements so called
		Maximum Likelihood Multiple Imputation as described by von
		Hippel (2018) arXiv:1210.0870v9. A number of different
		imputations are available, by utilising the 'norm', 'cat' and
		'mix' packages. Inferences can be performed either using
		combination rules similar to Rubin's or using a likelihood
		score based approach based on theory by Wang and Robins (1998)
