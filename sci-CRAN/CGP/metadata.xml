		Composite Gaussian Process Models // Fit composite Gaussian
		process (CGP) models as described in Ba and Joseph (2012)
		"Composite Gaussian Process Models for Emulating Expensive
		Functions", Annals of Applied Statistics. The CGP model is
		capable of approximating complex surfaces that are not second-
		order stationary.  Important functions in this package are CGP,
		print.CGP, summary.CGP, predict.CGP and plotCGP.
