		A Mutual Information-Weighted k-NN Imputation Algorithm //
		Implementation of an adaptive weighted k-nearest neighbours
		(wk-NN) imputation algorithm for clinical register data
		developed to explicitly handle missing values of
		continuous/ordinal/categorical and static/dynamic features
		conjointly. For each subject with missing data to be imputed,
		the method creates a feature vector constituted by the
		information collected over his/her first 'window_size' time
		units of visits. This vector is used as sample in a k-nearest
		neighbours procedure, in order to select, among the other
		patients, the ones with the most similar temporal evolution of
		the disease over time. An ad hoc similarity metric was
		implemented for the sample comparison, capable of handling the
		different nature of the data, the presence of multiple missing
		values and include the cross-information among features.
