		Helpful Additional Infix Functions // Infix functions in R are
		those that comes between its arguments such as %in%, +, and *.
		These are useful in R programming when manipulating data,
		performing logical operations, and making new functions.
		'infixit' extends the infix functions found in R to simplify
		frequent tasks, such as finding elements that are NOT in a set,
		in-line text concatenation, augmented assignment operations,
		additional logical and control flow operators, and identifying
		if a number or date lies between two others.
