		Factor Adjusted Robust Model Selection // Implements a consistent
		model selection strategy for high dimensional sparse regression
		when the covariate dependence can be reduced through factor
		models. By separating the latent factors from idiosyncratic
		components, the problem is transformed from model selection
		with highly correlated covariates to that with weakly
		correlated variables. It is appropriate for cases where we have
		many variables compared to the number of samples. Moreover, it
		implements a robust procedure to estimate distribution
		parameters wherever possible, hence being suitable for cases
		when the underlying distribution deviates from Gaussianity. See
		the paper on the 'FarmSelect' method, Fan et al.(2017)
		arXiv:1612.08490, for detailed description of methods and
		further references.
