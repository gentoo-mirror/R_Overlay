		Effect Size Estimation and Visualisation // An easy-to-use yet
		powerful system for plotting grouped data effect sizes. Various
		types of effect size can be estimated, then plotted together
		with a representation of the original data. Select from many
		possible data representations (box plots, violin plots, raw
		data points etc.), and combine as desired. 'Durga' plots are
		implemented in base R, so are compatible with base R methods
		for combining plots, such as 'layout()'. See Khan  McLean
