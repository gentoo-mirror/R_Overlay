		L1 Regularized Regression (Lasso) Solver using the Cyclic
		Coordinate Descent Algorithm aka Lasso Shooting // L1
		regularized regression (Lasso) solver using the Cyclic
		Coordinate Descent algorithm aka Lasso Shooting is fast. This
		implementation can choose which coefficients to penalize. It
		support coefficient-specific penalties and it can take X'X and
		X'y instead of X and y.
