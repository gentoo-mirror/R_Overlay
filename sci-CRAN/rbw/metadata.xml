		Residual Balancing Weights for Marginal Structural Models //
		Residual balancing is a robust method of constructing weights
		for marginal structural models, which can be used to estimate
		marginal effects of time-varying treatments and controlled
		direct/mediator effects in causal mediation analysis (Zhou and
		Wodtke 2020 doi:10.1017/pan.2020.2). This package provides two
		main functions, rbwPanel() and rbwMed(), that produce residual
		balancing weights for analyzing time-varying treatments and
		causal mediation respectively.
