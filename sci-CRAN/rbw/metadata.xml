		Residual Balancing Weights for Marginal Structural Models //
		Residual balancing is a robust method of constructing weights
		for marginal structural models, which can be used to estimate
		(a) the average treatment effect in a cross-sectional
		observational study, (b) controlled direct/mediator effects in
		causal mediation analysis, and (c) the effects of time-varying
		treatments in panel data (Zhou and Wodtke 2020
		doi:10.1017/pan.2020.2). This package provides three functions,
		rbwPoint(), rbwMed(), and rbwPanel(), that produce residual
		balancing weights for estimating (a), (b), (c), respectively.
