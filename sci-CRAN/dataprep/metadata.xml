		Efficient and Flexible Data Preprocessing Tools // Efficiently
		and flexibly preprocess data using a set of data filtering,
		deletion, and interpolation tools. These data preprocessing
		methods are developed based on the principles of completeness,
		accuracy, threshold method, and linear interpolation and
		through the setting of constraint conditions, time completion
		recovery, and fast  efficient calculation of moving averages.
		Key preprocessing steps include deletions of variables and
		observations, outlier removal, and missing values (NA)
		interpolation, which are dependent on the incomplete and
		dispersed degrees of raw data. They clean data more accurately,
		keep more samples, and add no outliers after interpolation,
		compared with ordinary methods. Auto-identification of
		consecutive NA via moving averages is used in observation
		deletion, outlier removal, and NA interpolation; thus, new
		outliers are not generated in interpolation. Conditional
		extremum is proposed to realize point-by-point weighed outlier
		removal that saves non-outliers from being removed. Plus, time
		series interpolation with values to refer to within short
		periods further ensures reliable interpolation. These methods
		are based on and improved from the reference: Liang, C.-S., Wu,
		H., Li, H.-Y., Zhang, Q., Li, Z.  He, K.-B. (2020)
