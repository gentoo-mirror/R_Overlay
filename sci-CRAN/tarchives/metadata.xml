		Make Your 'targets' Pipelines into a Package // Runs 'targets'
		pipeline in '/inst/tarchives' and stores the results in the R
		user directory. This means that the user does not have to run
		the process repeatedly, and the developer has the flexibility
		to update the data as versions are updated.
