		Factor-Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing // Performs robust
		multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown
		latent factors presented in Fan et al.(2019) "FarmTest: Factor-
		Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing With Approximate False
		Discovery Control" doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1527700.
		Implements a series of adaptive Huber methods combined with
		fast data-drive tuning schemes proposed in Ke et al.(2019)
		"User-Friendly Covariance Estimation for Heavy-Tailed
		Distributions" doi:10.1214/19-STS711 to estimate model
		parameters and construct test statistics that are robust
		against heavy-tailed and/or asymmetric error distributions.
		Extensions to two-sample simultaneous mean comparison problems
		are also included. As by-products, this package contains
		functions that compute adaptive Huber mean, covariance and
		regression estimators that are of independent interest.
