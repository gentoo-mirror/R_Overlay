		Factor Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing // Performs robust
		multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown
		latent factors. It implements a robust procedure to estimate
		distribution parameters using the Huber's loss function and
		accounts for strong dependence among coordinates via an
		approximate factor model. This method is particularly suitable
		for high dimensional data when there are many variables but
		only a small number of observations available. Moreover, the
		method is tailored to cases when the underlying distribution
		deviates from Gaussian, which is commonly assumed in the
		literature. Besides the results of hypotheses testing, the
		estimated underlying factors and diagnostic plots are also
		output. Multiple comparison correction is done after estimating
		the proportion of true null hypotheses using the method in
		Storey (2015) https://github.com/jdstorey/qvalue. See the paper
		on the 'FarmTest' method, Zhou et al.(2017)
		https://goo.gl/68SJpd, for detailed description of methods and
		further references.
