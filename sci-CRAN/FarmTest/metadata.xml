		Factor Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing // Performs robust
		multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown
		latent factors. It implements a series of adaptive Huber
		methods combined with fast data-drive tuning schemes to
		estimate model parameters and construct test statistics that
		are robust against heavy-tailed and/or asymetric error
		distributions. Extensions to two-sample simultaneous mean
		comparison problems are also included. As by-products, this
		package also contains functions that compute adaptive Huber
		mean and covariance matrix estimators that are of independent
		interest.
