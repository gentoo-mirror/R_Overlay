		Analysis of Conflicting Claims // The analysis of conflicting
		claims arises when an amount has to be divided among a set of
		agents with claims that exceed what is available. A rule is a
		way of selecting a division among the claimants. This package
		computes the main rules introduced in the literature from
		ancient times to the present. The inventory of rules covers the
		proportional and the adjusted proportional rules, the
		constrained equal awards and the constrained equal losses
		rules, the constrained egalitarian, the Piniles and the minimal
		overlap rules, the random arrival and the Talmud rules.
		Besides, the Dominguez and Thomson and the average-of-awards
		rules are also included.  All of them can be found in the book
		by W. Thomson (2019), How to divide when there isn't enough.
		From Aristotle, the Talmud, and Maimonides to the axiomatics of
		resource allocation', except for the average-of-awards rule,
		introduced by Mirs Calvo et al. (2022),
		doi:10.1007/s00355-022-01414-6.  In addition, graphical
		diagrams allow the user to represent, among others, the set of
		awards, the paths of awards, the schedules of awards of a rule,
		and some indexes. A good understanding of the similarities and
		differences between the rules is useful for better decision-
		making. Therefore, this package could be helpful to students,
		researchers, and managers alike.  For a more detailed
		explanation of the package, see Mirs Calvo et al. (2023),
		doi:10.1016/j.dajour.2022.100160.
