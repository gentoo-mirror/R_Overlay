		Analysis of Conflicting Claims // The analysis of conflicting
		claims arises when an amount has to be divided among a set of
		agents with claims that exceed what is available. A rule is a
		way of selecting a  division among the claimants. This package
		computes the main rules introduced in the literature from the
		old times until nowadays. The inventory of rules covers the
		proportional and the adjusted proportional rules, the
		constrained equal awards and the constrained equal losses
		rules, the  constrained egalitarian, the Piniles and the
		minimal overlap rules, the random arrival and the Talmud rules.
		Besides, the Dominguez and Thomson and the average of awards
		rules are also included. All of them can be found in the book
		of W. Thomson (2019), 'How to divide when there isn't enough.
		From Aristotle, the Talmud, and Maimonides to the axiomatics of
		resource allocation'. Cambridge University Press, ISBN:
		9781316646441, with the exception of the average of awards rule
		(Mirs et al. (2020) http://ecobas.webs.uvigo.es/wk/2020-02-core
		centerforthebankruptcyproblem.pdf). In addition,  graphical
		diagrams allow the user to represent, among others, the set of
		awards, the paths of awards, and the schedules of awards of a
		rule, and some indexes. A good understanding of the
		similarities and the differences of the rules is useful for a
		better decision making. Therefore this package could be helpful
		to students, researchers and managers alike.
