		or a character vector of fractions.  Supports mixed or improper
		fractions, finding common denominators for vectors of
		fractions, limiting denominators to powers of ten, and limiting
		denominators to a maximum value.  Also includes helper
		functions for finding the least common multiple and greatest
		common divisor for a vector of integers.  Implemented using C++
