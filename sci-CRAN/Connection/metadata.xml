		Measures of Independence and Connection Without Linear Models //
		Provides tools to measure connection and independence between
		variables without relying on linear models. Includes functions
		to compute Eta squared, Chi-squared, and Cramer V. The main
		advantage of this package is that it works without requiring
		parametric assumptions. The methods implemented are based on
		educational material and statistical decomposition techniques,
		not directly on previously published software or articles.
