		Transform Serial R Code into Parallel R Code // Writing parallel
		R code can be difficult, particularly for code that is not
		"embarrassingly parallel". This experimental package automates
		the transformation of serial R code into more efficient
		parallel versions. It identifies task parallelism by statically
		analyzing entire scripts to detect dependencies between
		statements. It implements an extensible system for scheduling
		and generating new code. It includes a reference implementation
		of the 'List Scheduling' approach to the general task
		scheduling problem of scheduling statements on multiple
		processors.
