		Distinct Colour Palettes Based on 'iwanthue' // Creating
		effective colour palettes for figures is challenging. This
		package generates and plot palettes of optimally distinct
		colours in perceptually uniform colour space, based on
		'iwanthue' http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/. This
		is done through k-means clustering of CIE Lab colour space,
		according to user-selected constraints on hue, chroma, and
		lightness.
