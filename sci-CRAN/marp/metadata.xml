		Model-Averaged Renewal Process // To implement a model-averaging
		approach with different renewal models, with a primary focus on
		forecasting large earthquakes. Based on six renewal models
		(i.e., Poisson, Gamma, Log-Logistics, Weibull, Log-Normal and
		BPT), model-averaged point estimates are calculated using AIC
		(or BIC) weights. Additionally, both percentile and studentized
		bootstrapped model-averaged confidence intervals are
		constructed. In comparison, point and interval estimation from
		the individual or "best" model (determined via model selection)
		can be retrieved.
