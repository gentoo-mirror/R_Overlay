		Matching Event Data by Location, Time and Type // Framework for
		merging and disambiguating event data based on spatiotemporal
		co-occurrence and secondary event characteristics. It can
		account for intrinsic "fuzziness" in the coding of events,
		varying event taxonomies and different geo-precision codes.
