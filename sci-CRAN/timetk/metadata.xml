		A Tool Kit for Working with Time Series // Get the time series
		index (date or date-time component), time series signature
		(feature extraction of date or date-time component for time
		series machine learning), and time series summary (summary
		attributes about time series). Create future time series based
		on properties of existing time series index using logistic
		regression. Coerce between time-based tibbles ('tbl') and
		'xts', 'zoo', and 'ts'. Methods discussed herein are
		commonplace in machine learning, and have been cited in various
		literature. Refer to "Calendar Effects" in papers such as
		Taieb, Souhaib Ben. "Machine learning strategies for multi-
		step-ahead time series forecasting." Universit Libre de
		Bruxelles, Belgium (2014): 75-86. http://souhaib-
