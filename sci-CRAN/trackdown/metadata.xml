		Collaborative Editing of Rmd (or Rnw) Documents in Google Drive
		// Collaborative writing and editing of R Markdown (or Sweave)
		documents. The local .Rmd (or .Rnw) is uploaded as a plain-text
		file to Google Drive. By taking advantage of the easily
		readable Markdown (or LaTeX) syntax and the well-known online
		interface offered by Google Docs, collaborators can easily
		contribute to the writing and editing process. After
		integrating all authors contributions, the final document can
		be downloaded and rendered locally.
