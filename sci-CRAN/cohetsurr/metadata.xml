		Assessing Complex Heterogeneity in Surrogacy // Provides
		functions to assess and test for complex heterogeneity in the
		utility of a surrogate marker with respect to multiple baseline
		covariates, using both a parametric model and a semiparametric
		two-step model. More details are available in: Knowlton, R.,
		Tian, L.,  Parast, L. (2025). "A General Framework to Assess
		Complex Heterogeneity in the Strength of a Surrogate Marker,"
		Statistics in Medicine, 44(5), e70001 doi:10.1002/sim.70001. A
		tutorial for this package can be found at
