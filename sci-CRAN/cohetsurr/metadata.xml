		Assessing Complex Heterogeneity in Surrogacy // Provides
		functions to assess complex heterogeneity in the strength of a
		surrogate marker with respect to multiple baseline covariates,
		in either a randomized treatment setting or observational
		setting. For a randomized treatment setting, the functions
		assess and test for heterogeneity using both a parametric model
		and a semiparametric two-step model. More details for the
		randomized setting are available in: Knowlton, R., Tian, L.,
		Parast, L. (2025). "A General Framework to Assess Complex
		Heterogeneity in the Strength of a Surrogate Marker,"
		Statistics in Medicine, 44(5), e70001 doi:10.1002/sim.70001.
		For an observational setting, functions in this package assess
		complex heterogeneity in the strength of a surrogate marker
		using meta-learners, with options for different base learners.
		More details for the observational setting will be available in
		the future in: Knowlton, R., Parast, L. (2025) "Assessing
		Surrogate Heterogeneity in Real World Data Using Meta-
		Learners." A tutorial for this package can be found at
		https://www.laylaparast.com/cohetsurr.
