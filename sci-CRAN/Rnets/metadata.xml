		Resistance Relationship Networks using Graphical LASSO // Novel
		methods are needed to analyze the large amounts of
		antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data generated by AMR
		surveillance programs. This package is used to estimate
		resistance relationship networks, or 'Rnets', from empirical
		antimicrobial susceptibility data. These networks can be used
		to study relationships between antimicrobial resistances
		(typically measured using MICs) and genes in populations. The
		'GitHub' for this package is available at
		https://GitHub.com/EpidemiologyDVM/Rnets. Bug reports and
		features requests should be directed to the same 'GitHub' site.
		The methods used in 'Rnets' are available in the following
		publications: An overview of the method in WJ Love, et al.,
		"Markov Networks of Collateral Resistance: National
		Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System Surveillance Results
		from Escherichia coli Isolates, 2004-2012" (2016)
