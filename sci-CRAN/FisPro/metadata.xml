		Fuzzy Inference System Design and Optimization // Fuzzy inference
		systems are based on fuzzy rules, which have a good capability
		for managing progressive phenomenons. This package is a basic
		implementation of the main functions to use a Fuzzy Inference
		System (FIS) provided by the open source software 'FisPro'
		https://www.fispro.org. 'FisPro' allows to create fuzzy
		inference systems and to use them for reasoning purposes,
		especially for simulating a physical or biological system.
