		Frictionless Standards // A "tabular-data-resource"
		(https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) is a
		simple format to describe a singular tabular data resource such
		as a CSV file. It includes support both for metadata such as
		author and title and a schema to describe the data, for example
		the types of the fields/columns in the data. Create a tabular-
		data-resource by providing a data.frame and specifying
		metadata. Write and read tabular-data-resources to and from
		disk.
