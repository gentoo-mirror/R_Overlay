		Simulate Survival Data // Simulate survival times from standard
		parametric survival distributions (exponential, Weibull,
		Gompertz), 2-component mixture distributions, or a user-defined
		hazard or log hazard function. Baseline covariates can be
		included under a proportional hazards assumption. Time
		dependent effects (i.e. non-proportional hazards) can be
		included by interacting covariates with linear time or some
		transformation of time. The 2-component mixture distributions
		can allow for a variety of flexible baseline hazard functions.
		If the user wishes to provide a user-defined hazard or log
		hazard function then this is also possible, and the resulting
		cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form
		solution. Note that this package is modelled on the 'survsim'
		package available in the 'Stata' software (see Crowther and
		Lambert (2012) http://www.stata-
		journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0275 or Crowther and
		Lambert (2013) doi:10.1002/sim.5823).
