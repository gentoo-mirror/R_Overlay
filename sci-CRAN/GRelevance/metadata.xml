		Graph-Based k-Sample Comparisons and Relevance Analysis in High
		Dimensions // We propose two distribution-free test statistics
		based on between-sample edge counts and measure the degree of
		relevance by standardized counts. Users can set edge costs in
		the graph to compare the parameters of the distributions.
		Methods for comparing distributions are as described in:
