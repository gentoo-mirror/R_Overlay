		Calculate Effective Number of Clusters for a Linear Model //
		Calculates the (approximate) effective number of clusters for a
		regression model, as described in Carter, Schnepel, and
		Steigerwald (2017) doi:10.1162/REST_a_00639.  The effective
		number of clusters is a statistic to assess the reliability of
		asymptotic inference when sampling or treatment assignment is
		clustered. Methods are implemented for stats::lm(), plm::plm(),
		and fixest::feols(). There is also a formula method.
