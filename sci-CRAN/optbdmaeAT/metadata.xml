		Optimal Block Designs for Two-Colour cDNA Microarray Experiments
		// Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal block
		designs for two-colour cDNA microarray experiments using the
		linear fixed effects and mixed effects models where the
		interest is in a comparison of all possible elementary
		treatment contrasts. The algorithms used in this package are
		based on the treatment exchange and array exchange algorithms
		of Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2018)
		doi:10.1080/03610918.2018.1429617. The package also provides an
		optional method of using the graphical user interface (GUI) R
		package tcltk to ensure that it is user friendly.
