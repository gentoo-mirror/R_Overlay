		Automated MALDI Cell Assays Using Dose-Response Curve Fitting //
		Conduct automated cell-based assays using Matrix-Assisted Laser
		Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) methods for high-throughput
		screening of signals responsive to treatments. The package
		efficiently identifies high variance signals and fits dose-
		response curves to them. Quality metrics such as Z', V',
		log2FC, and CRS are provided for evaluating the potential of
		signals as biomarkers. The methodologies were introduced by
		Weigt et al. (2018) doi:10.1038/s41598-018-29677-z and refined
		by Unger et al. (2021) doi:10.1038/s41596-021-00624-z.
