		Whole Genome Phylogenies Using Sequence Environments // Contains
		utilities for the analysis of protein sequences in a
		phylogenetic context. Allows   the generation of phylogenetic
		trees base on protein sequences in an alignment-independent
		way. Two different methods have been implemented. One approach
		is based on the frequency analysis of n-grams, previously
		described in Stuart et al. (2002)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/18.1.100. The other approach is
		based on the species-specific neighborhood preference around
		amino acids. Features include the conversion of a protein set
		into a vector reflecting these neighborhood preferences,
		pairwise distances (dissimilarity) between these vectors, and
		the generation of trees based on these distance matrices.
