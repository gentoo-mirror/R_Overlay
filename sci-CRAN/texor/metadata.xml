		Converting 'LaTeX' 'R Journal' Articles into 'RJ-web-articles' //
		Articles in the 'R Journal' were first authored in 'LaTeX',
		which performs admirably for 'PDF' files but is less than ideal
		for modern online interfaces. The 'texor' package does all the
		transitional chores and conversions necessary to move to the
		online versions.
