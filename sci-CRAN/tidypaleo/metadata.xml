		Tidy Tools for Paleoenvironmental Archives // Provides a set of
		functions with a common framework for age-depth model
		management, stratigraphic visualization, and common statistical
		transformations. The focus of the package is stratigraphic
		visualization, for which 'ggplot2' components are provided to
		reproduce the scales, geometries, facets, and theme elements
		commonly used in publication-quality stratigraphic diagrams.
		Helpers are also provided to reproduce the exploratory
		statistical summaries that are frequently included on
		stratigraphic diagrams. See Dunnington et al. (2021)
