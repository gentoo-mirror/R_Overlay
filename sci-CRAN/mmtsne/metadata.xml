		Multiple Maps t-SNE // An implementation of multiple maps
		t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Multiple
		maps t-SNE is a method for projecting high-dimensional data
		into several low-dimensional maps such that non-metric space
		properties are better preserved than they would be by a single
		map. Multiple maps t-SNE with only one map is equivalent to
		standard t-SNE. When projecting onto more than one map,
		multiple maps t-SNE estimates a set of latent weights that
		allow each point to contribute to one or more maps depending on
		similarity relationships in the original data. This
		implementation is a port of the original 'Matlab' library by
		Laurens van der Maaten. See Van der Maaten and Hinton (2012)
