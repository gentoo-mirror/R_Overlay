		Chandler-Bate Sandwich Loglikelihood Adjustment // Performs
		adjustments of a user-supplied independence loglikelihood
		function using a robust sandwich estimator of the parameter
		covariance matrix, based on the methodology in Chandler and
		Bate (2007) doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015.  This can be used for
		cluster correlated data when interest lies in the parameters of
		the marginal distributions or for performing inferences that
		are robust to certain types of model misspecification.
		Functions for profiling the adjusted loglikelihoods are also
		provided, as are functions for calculating and plotting
		confidence intervals, for single model parameters, and
		confidence regions, for pairs of model parameters.  Nested
		models can be compared using an adjusted likelihood ratio test.
