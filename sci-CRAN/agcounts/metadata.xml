		Calculate 'ActiGraph' Counts from Accelerometer Data // Calculate
		'ActiGraph' counts from the X, Y, and Z axes of a triaxial
		accelerometer. This work was inspired by Neishabouri et al. who
		published the article "Quantification of Acceleration as
		Activity Counts in 'ActiGraph' Wearables" on February 24, 2022.
		The link to the article
		(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35831446) and 'python'
		implementation of this code
