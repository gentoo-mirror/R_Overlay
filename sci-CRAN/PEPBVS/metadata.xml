		Bayesian Variable Selection using Power-Expected-Posterior Prior
		// Performs Bayesian variable selection under normal linear
		models for the data with the model parameters following as
		prior either the power-expected-posterior (PEP) or the
		intrinsic (a special case of the former) (Fouskakis and
		Ntzoufras (2022) doi: 10.1214/21-BA1288, Fouskakis and
		Ntzoufras (2020) doi: 10.3390/econometrics8020017). The prior
		distribution on model space is the uniform on model space or
		the uniform on model dimension (a special case of the beta-
		binomial prior). The selection can be done either with full
		enumeration of all possible models or using the Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo Model Composition (MC3) algorithm (Madigan and York
		(1995) doi: 10.2307/1403615). Complementary functions for
		making predictions, as well as plotting and printing the
		results are also provided.
