		Bayesian Inference for Log-Normal Data // Bayesian inference
		under log-normality assumption must be performed very
		carefully. In fact, under the common priors for the variance,
		useful quantities in the original data scale (like mean and
		quantiles) do not have posterior moments that are finite
		(Fabrizi et al. 2012 doi:10.1214/12-BA733). This package allows
		to easily carry out a proper Bayesian inferential procedure by
		fixing a suitable distribution (the generalized inverse
		Gaussian) as prior for the variance. Functions to estimate
		several kind of means (unconditional, conditional and
		conditional under a mixed model) and quantiles (unconditional
		and conditional) are provided.
