		Tools for Cleaning Up Messy Files // Some tools for cleaning up
		messy 'Excel' files to be suitable for R. People who have been
		working with 'Excel' for years built more or less complicated
		sheets with names, characters, formats that are not
		homogeneous. To be able to use them in R nowadays, we built a
		set of functions that will avoid the majority of importation
		problems and keep all the data at best.
