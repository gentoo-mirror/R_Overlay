		Power Calculations for Assessing Correlates of Risk in Clinical
		Efficacy Trials // Calculates power for assessment of
		intermediate biomarker responses as correlates of risk in the
		active treatment group in clinical efficacy trials, as
		described in Gilbert, Janes, and Huang, Power/Sample Size
		Calculations for Assessing Correlates of Risk in Clinical
		Efficacy Trials (2016, Statistics in Medicine). The methods
		differ from past approaches by accounting for the level of
		clinical treatment efficacy overall and in biomarker response
		subgroups, which enables the correlates of risk results to be
		interpreted in terms of potential correlates of
		efficacy/protection. The methods also account for inter-
		individual variability of the observed biomarker response that
		is not biologically relevant (e.g., due to technical
		measurement error of the laboratory assay used to measure the
		biomarker response), which is important because power to detect
		a specified correlate of risk effect size is heavily affected
		by the biomarker's measurement error. The methods can be used
		for a general binary clinical endpoint model with a univariate
		dichotomous, trichotomous, or continuous biomarker response
		measured in active treatment recipients at a fixed timepoint
		after randomization, with either case-cohort Bernoulli sampling
		or case-control without-replacement sampling of the biomarker
		(a baseline biomarker is handled as a trivial special case). In
		a specified two-group trial design, the computeN() function can
		initially be used for calculating additional requisite design
		parameters pertaining to the target population of active
		treatment recipients observed to be at risk at the biomarker
		sampling timepoint. Subsequently, the power calculation employs
		an inverse probability weighted logistic regression model
		fitted by the tps() function in the 'osDesign' package. Power
		results as well as the relationship between the correlate of
		risk effect size and treatment efficacy can be visualized using
		various plotting functions. To link power calculations for
		detecting a correlate of risk and a correlate of treatment
		efficacy, a baseline immunogenicity predictor (BIP) can be
		simulated according to a specified classification rule (for
		dichotomous or trichotomous BIPs) or correlation with the
		biomarker response (for continuous BIPs), then outputted along
		with biomarker response data under assignment to treatment, and
		clinical endpoint data for both treatment and placebo groups.
