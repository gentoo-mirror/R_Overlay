		Design Shaded Contour Lines (or Tanaka) Maps // The Tanaka method
		enhances the representation of topography on a map using shaded
		contour lines. In this simplified implementation of the method,
		north-west white contours represent illuminated topography and
		south-east black contours represent shaded topography. See
