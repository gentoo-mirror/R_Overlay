		Threshold regression that fits the (randomized drift) inverse
		Gaussian distribution to survival data. // invGauss fits the
		(randomized drift) inverse Gaussian distribution to survival
		data. The model is described in Aalen OO, Borgan O, Gjessing
		HK. Survival and Event History Analysis. A Process Point of
		View. Springer, 2008. It is based on describing time to event
		as the barrier hitting time of a Wiener process, where drift
		towards the barrier has been randomized with a Gaussian
		distribution. The model allows covariates to influence starting
		values of the Wiener process and/or average drift towards a
		barrier, with a user-defined choice of link functions.
