		Threshold Regression that Fits the (Randomized Drift) Inverse
		Gaussian Distribution to Survival Data // Fits the (randomized
		drift) inverse Gaussian distribution to survival data. The
		model is described in Aalen OO, Borgan O, Gjessing HK. Survival
		and Event History Analysis. A Process Point of View. Springer,
		2008. It is based on describing time to event as the barrier
		hitting time of a Wiener process, where drift towards the
		barrier has been randomized with a Gaussian distribution. The
		model allows covariates to influence starting values of the
		Wiener process and/or average drift towards a barrier, with a
		user-defined choice of link functions.
