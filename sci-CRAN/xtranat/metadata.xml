		Network Metrics Based on Random Walks // There are two new
		network metrics, RWC (random walk centrality) and CBET
		(counting betweenness). Also available are the normalized
		versions of those metrics. These measures of centrality and
		betweenness are particularly useful for the analysis of very
		dense weighted networks which include loops. Traditional
		measures do not work as well for those network characteristics.
