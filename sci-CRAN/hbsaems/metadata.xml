		Hierarchical Bayes Small Area Estimation Model using 'Stan' //
		Implementing Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation models
		using the 'brms' package as the computational backend. The
		modeling framework follows the methodological foundations
		described in area-level models. This package is designed to
		facilitate a principled Bayesian workflow, enabling users to
		conduct prior predictive checks, model fitting, posterior
		predictive checks, model comparison, and sensitivity analysis
		in a coherent and reproducible manner. It supports flexible
		model specifications via 'brms' and promotes transparency in
		model development, aligned with the recommendations of modern
		Bayesian data analysis practices, implementing methods
		described in Rao and Molina (2015) doi:10.1002/9781118735855.
