		Sparse-Group SLOPE: Adaptive Bi-Level Selection with FDR Control
		// Implementation of Sparse-group SLOPE: Adaptive bi-level with
		FDR-control (Feser et al. (2023) arXiv:2305.09467). Linear and
		logistic regression models are supported, both of which can be
		fit using k-fold cross-validation. Dense and sparse input
		matrices are supported. In addition, a general adaptive three
		operator splitting (ATOS) implementation is provided.
