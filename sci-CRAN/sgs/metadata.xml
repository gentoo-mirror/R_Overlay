		Sparse-Group SLOPE: Adaptive Bi-Level Selection with FDR Control
		// Implementation of Sparse-group SLOPE (SGS) (Feser and
		Evangelou (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2305.09467) models. Linear
		and logistic regression models are supported, both of which can
		be fit using k-fold cross-validation. Dense and sparse input
		matrices are supported. In addition, a general adaptive three
		operator splitting (ATOS) implementation is provided. Group
		SLOPE (gSLOPE) (Brzyski et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1411269) models are also implemented.
		Both gSLOPE and SGS are available with strong screening rules
		(Feser and Evangelou (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2405.15357) for
		computational speed-up.
