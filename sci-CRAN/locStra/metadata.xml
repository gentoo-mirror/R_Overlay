		Fast Implementation of (Local) Population Stratification Methods
		// Fast implementations to compute the genetic covariance
		matrix, the Jaccard similarity matrix, the s-matrix (the
		weighted Jaccard similarity matrix), and the (classic or
		robust) genomic relationship matrix of a (dense or sparse)
		input matrix (see Hahn, Lutz, Hecker, Prokopenko, Cho,
		Silverman, Weiss, and Lange (2020) doi:10.1002/gepi.22356).
		Full support for sparse matrices from the R-package 'Matrix'.
		Additionally, an implementation of the power method (von Mises
		iteration) to compute the largest eigenvector of a matrix is
		included, a function to perform an automated full run of global
		and local correlations in population stratification data, a
		function to compute sliding windows, and a function to invert
		minor alleles and to select those variants/loci exceeding a
		minimal cutoff value. New functionality in locStra allows one
		to extract the k leading eigenvectors of the genetic covariance
		matrix, Jaccard similarity matrix, s-matrix, and genomic
		relationship matrix without actually computing the similarity
		matrices.
