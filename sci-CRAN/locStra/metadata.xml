		Fast Implementation of (Local) Population Stratification Methods
		// Fast and fully sparse 'cpp' implementations to compute the
		genetic covariance matrix, the genomic relationship matrix, the
		Jaccard matrix, and the s-matrix of an input matrix. Full
		support for sparse matrices from the R-package 'Matrix'.
		Additionally, a 'cpp' implementation of the power method (von
		Mises iteration) algorithm to compute the largest eigenvector
		of a matrix is included, and a function to compute sliding
		windows.
