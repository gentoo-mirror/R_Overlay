		Fast Implementation of (Local) Population Stratification Methods
		// Fast implementations to compute the genetic covariance
		matrix, the Jaccard similarity matrix, the s-matrix (the
		weighted Jaccard similarity matrix), and the (classic or
		robust) genomic relationship matrix of a (dense or sparse)
		input matrix. Full support for sparse matrices from the
		R-package 'Matrix'. Additionally, an implementation of the
		power method (von Mises iteration) to compute the largest
		eigenvector of a matrix is included, a function to perform an
		automated full run of global and local correlations in
		population stratification data, and a function to compute
		sliding windows. New functionality in locStra allows one to
		extract the k leading eigenvectors of the genetic covariance
		matrix, Jaccard similarity matrix, s-matrix, and genomic
		relationship matrix without actually computing the similarity
		matrices.
