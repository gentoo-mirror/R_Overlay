		Time-Ordered and Time-Aggregated Network Analyses // Approaches
		for incorporating time into network analysis. Methods include:
		construction of time-ordered networks (temporal graphs);
		shortest-time and shortest-path-length analyses; resource
		spread calculations; data resampling and rarefaction for null
		model construction; reduction to time-aggregated networks with
		variable window sizes; application of common descriptive
		statistics to these networks; vector clock latencies; and
		plotting functionalities. The package supports
