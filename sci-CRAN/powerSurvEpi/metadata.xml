		Power and sample size calculation for survival analysis of
		epidemiological studies // This package includes a set of
		functions to calculate power and sample size for testing main
		effect or interaction effect in the survival analysis of
		epidemiological studies (non-randomized studies), taking into
		account the correlation between the covariate of the interest
		and other covariates. Some calculations also take into account
		the competing risks and stratified analysis.  This package also
		includes a set of functions to calculate power and sample size
		for testing main effect in the survival analysis of randomized
		clinical trials.
