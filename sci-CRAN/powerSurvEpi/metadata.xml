		Power and Sample Size Calculation for Survival Analysis of
		Epidemiological Studies // Functions to calculate power and
		sample size for testing main effect or interaction effect in
		the survival analysis of epidemiological studies (non-
		randomized studies), taking into account the correlation
		between the covariate of the interest and other covariates.
		Some calculations also take into account the competing risks
		and stratified analysis. This package also includes a set of
		functions to calculate power and sample size for testing main
		effect in the survival analysis of randomized clinical trials
		and conditional logistic regression for nested case-control
		study.
