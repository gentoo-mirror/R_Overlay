		Odds Ratio Calculation for GAM(M)s  GLM(M)s // Simplified odds
		ratio calculation of GAM(M)s  GLM(M)s. Provides structured
		output (data frame) of all predictors and their corresponding
		odds ratios and confident intervals for further analyses. It
		helps to avoid false references of predictors and increments by
		specifying these parameters in a list instead of using
		'exp(coef(model))' (standard approach of odds ratio calculation
		for GLMs) which just returns a plain numeric output. For
		GAM(M)s, odds ratio calculation is highly simplified with this
		package since it takes care of the multiple 'predict()' calls
		of the chosen predictor while holding other predictors
		constant. Also, this package allows odds ratio calculation of
		percentage steps across the whole predictor distribution range
		for GAM(M)s. In both cases, confident intervals are returned
		additionally. Calculated odds ratio of GAM(M)s can be inserted
		into the smooth function plot.
