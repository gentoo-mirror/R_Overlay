		Vine Based (Un)Conditional Portfolio Risk Measure Estimation //
		Following Sommer (2022) https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1658240
		portfolio level risk estimates (e.g. Value at Risk, Expected
		Shortfall) are estimated by modeling each asset univariately by
		an ARMA-GARCH model and then their cross dependence via a Vine
		Copula model in a rolling window fashion. One can even
		condition on variables/time series at certain quantile levels
		to stress test the risk measure estimates.
