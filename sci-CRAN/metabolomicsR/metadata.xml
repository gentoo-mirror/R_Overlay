		Tools for Metabolomics Data // Tools to preprocess, analyse, and
		visualize metabolomics data. We included a set of functions for
		sample and metabolite quality control, outlier detection,
		missing value imputation, dimensional reduction, normalization,
		data integration, regression, metabolite annotation, enrichment
		analysis, and visualization of data and results. The package is
		designed to be a comprehensive R package that can be easily
		used by researchers with basic R programming skills. The
		framework designed here is versatile and is extensible to other
		various methods.
