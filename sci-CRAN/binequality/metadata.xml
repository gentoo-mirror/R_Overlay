		Methods for Analyzing Binned Income Data // Methods for model
		selection, model averaging, and calculating metrics, such as
		the Gini, Theil, Mean Log Deviation, etc, on binned income data
		where the topmost bin is right-censored.  We provide both a
		non-parametric method, termed the bounded midpoint estimator
		(BME), which assigns cases to their bin midpoints; except for
		the censored bins, where cases are assigned to an income
		estimated by fitting a Pareto distribution. Because the usual
		Pareto estimate can be inaccurate or undefined, especially in
		small samples, we implement a bounded Pareto estimate that
		yields much better results.  We also provide a parametric
		approach, which fits distributions from the generalized beta
		(GB) family. Because some GB distributions can have poor fit or
		undefined estimates, we fit 10 GB-family distributions and use
		multimodel inference to obtain definite estimates from the
		best-fitting distributions. We also provide binned income data
		from all United States of America school districts, counties,
		and states.
