		Extract Saccades via an Ensemble of Methods Approach // A modular
		and extendable approach to extract (micro)saccades from gaze
		samples via an ensemble of methods. Although there is an
		agreement about a general definition of a saccade, the more
		specific details are harder to agree upon. Therefore, there are
		numerous algorithms that extract saccades based on various
		heuristics, which differ in the assumptions about velocity,
		acceleration, etc. The package uses three methods (Engbert and
		Kliegl (2003) doi:10.1016/S0042-6989(03)00084-1, Otero-Millan
		et al. (2014)doi:10.1167/14.2.18, and Nystrm and Holmqvist
		(2010) doi:10.3758/BRM.42.1.188) to label individual samples
		and then applies a majority vote approach to identify saccades.
		The package includes three methods but can be extended via
		custom functions. It also uses a modular approach to compute
		velocity and acceleration from noisy samples. Finally, you can
		obtain methods votes per gaze sample instead of saccades.
