		Access to Spanish Household Income Distribution Atlas Data //
		Provides access to granular socioeconomic indicators from the
		Spanish Statistical Office (INE) Household Income Distribution
		Atlas. The package downloads and processes data from a
		companion 'GitHub' repository
		(https://github.com/pablogguz/ineAtlas.data/) which contains
		processed versions of the official INE Atlas data. Functions
		are provided to fetch data at multiple geographic levels
		(municipalities, districts, and census tracts), including
		income indicators, demographic characteristics, and inequality
		metrics. The data repository is updated every year when new
		releases are published by INE.
