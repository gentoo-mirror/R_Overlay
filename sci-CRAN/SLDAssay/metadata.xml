		Software for Analyzing Limiting Dilution Assays // Calculates
		maximum likelihood estimate, exact and asymptotic confidence
		intervals, and exact and asymptotic goodness of fit p-values
		for concentration of infectious units from serial limiting
		dilution assays. This package uses the likelihood equation,
		exact goodness of fit p-values, and exact confidence intervals
		described in Meyers et al. (1994)
		http://jcm.asm.org/content/32/3/732.full.pdf. This software is
		also implemented as a web application through the Shiny R
		package https://iupm.shinyapps.io/sldassay/.
