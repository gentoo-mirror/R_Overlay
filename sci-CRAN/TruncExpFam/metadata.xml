		Truncated Exponential Family // Handles truncated members from
		the exponential family of probability distributions. Contains
		functions such as rtruncnorm() and dtruncpois(), which are
		truncated versions of rnorm() and dpois() from the stats
		package that also offer richer output containing, for example,
		the distribution parameters. It also provides functions to
		retrieve the original distribution parameters from a truncated
		sample by maximum-likelihood estimation.
