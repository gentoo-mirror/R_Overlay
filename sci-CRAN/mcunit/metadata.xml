		Unit Tests for MC Methods // Unit testing for Monte Carlo
		methods, particularly Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods,
		are implemented as extensions of the 'testthat' package. The
		MCMC methods check whether the MCMC chain has the correct
		invariant distribution. They do not check other properties of
		successful samplers such as whether the chain can reach all
		points, i.e. whether is recurrent. The tests require the
		ability to sample from the prior and to run steps of the MCMC
		chain. The methodology is described in Gandy and Scott (2020)
		arXiv:2001.06465.
