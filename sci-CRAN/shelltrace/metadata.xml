		Bivalve Growth and Trace Element Accumulation Model // Contains
		all the formulae of the growth and trace element uptake model
		described in the equally-named Geoscientific Model Development
		paper (de Winter, 2017, doi:10.5194/gmd-2017-137). The model
		takes as input a file with X- and Y-coordinates of digitized
		growth increments recognized on a longitudinal cross section
		through the bivalve shell, as well as a BMP file of an
		elemental map of the cross section surface with chemically
		distinct phases separated by phase analysis. It proceeds by a
		step-by-step process described in the paper, by which digitized
		growth increments are used to calculate changes in shell
		height, shell thickness, shell volume, shell mass and shell
		growth rate through the bivalve's life time. Then, results of
		this growth modelling are combined with the trace element
		mapping results to trace the incorporation of trace elements
		into the bivalve shell. Results of various modelling parameters
		can be exported in the form of XLSX files.
