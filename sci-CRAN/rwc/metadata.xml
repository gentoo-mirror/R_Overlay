		Random Walk Covariance Models // Code to facilitate simulation
		and inference when connectivity is defined by underlying random
		walks.  Methods for spatially-correlated pairwise distance data
		are especially considered.  This provides core code to conduct
		analyses similar to that in Hanks and Hooten (2013)
