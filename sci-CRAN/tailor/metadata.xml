		Iterative Steps for Postprocessing Model Predictions //
		Postprocessors refine predictions outputted from machine
		learning models to improve predictive performance or better
		satisfy distributional limitations. This package introduces
		'tailor' objects, which compose iterative adjustments to model
		predictions. A number of pre-written adjustments are provided
		with the package, such as calibration. See Lichtenstein,
		Fischhoff, and Phillips (1977)
		doi:10.1007/978-94-010-1276-8_19. Other methods and utilities
		to compose new adjustments are also included. Tailors are
		tightly integrated with the 'tidymodels' framework.
