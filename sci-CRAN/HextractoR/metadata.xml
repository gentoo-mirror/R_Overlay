		Integrated Tool for Hairping Extraction of RNA Sequences //
		Simple and integrated tool that automatically extracts and
		folds all hairpin sequences from raw genome-wide data. It
		predicts the secondary structure of several overlapped
		segments, with longer length than the mean length of sequences
		of interest for the species under processing, ensuring that no
		one is lost nor inappropriately cut.
