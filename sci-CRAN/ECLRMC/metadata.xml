		Ensemble Correlation-Based Low-Rank Matrix Completion // Ensemble
		correlation-based low-rank matrix completion method (ECLRMC) is
		an extension to the LRMC based methods. Traditionally, the LRMC
		based methods give identical importance to the whole data which
		results in emphasizing on the commonality of the data and
		overlooking the subtle but crucial differences. This method
		aims to overcome the equality assumption problem that exists in
		the current LRMS based methods. Ensemble correlation-based low-
		rank matrix completion (ECLRMC) takes consideration of the
		specific characteristic of each sample and performs LRMC on the
		set of samples with a strong correlation. It uses an ensemble
		learning method to improve the imputation performance. Since
		each sample is analyzed independently this method can be
		parallelized by distributing imputation across many computation
		units or GPU platforms. This package provides three different
		methods (LRMC, CLRMC and ECLRMC) for data imputation. There is
		also an NRMS function for evaluating the result. Chen, Xiaobo,
		et al (2017) doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2017.06.010.
