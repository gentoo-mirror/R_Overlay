		Precision of Treatment Hierarchy (POTH) // Calculate POTH for
		treatment hierarchies from frequentist and Bayesian network
		meta-analysis. POTH quantifies the certainty in a treatment
		hierarchy. Subset POTH, POTH residuals, and cumulative POTH can
		also be calculated to improve interpretation of treatment
		hierarchies.
