		Hacks for 'ggplot2' // A 'ggplot2' extension that does a variety
		of little helpful things.  The package extends 'ggplot2' facets
		through customisation, by setting individual scales per panel,
		resizing panels and providing nested facets.  Also allows
		multiple colour and fill scales per plot. Also hosts a smaller
		collection of stats, geoms and axis guides.
