		Financial Functions  More // This fills the gaps credit analysts
		and loan modellers at Optimum Credit identify in the existing R
		code body.  It allows for the production of documentation with
		less coding, replicates a number of Microsoft Excel functions
		useful for modelling loans (without rounding), and other
		helpful functions for producing charts and tables.  It also has
		some additional scales for use, including a GBP scale.
