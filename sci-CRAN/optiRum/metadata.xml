		Miscellaneous functions for (primarily) finance / credit risk
		analysts // This fills the gaps credit analysts and loan
		modellers at Optimum Credit identify in the existing R code
		body. It allows for the production of documentation with less
		coding, replicates a number of Microsoft Excel functions useful
		for modelling loans (without rounding), and other helpful
		functions for producing charts and tables.  It also has some
		additional scales for use, including a GBP scale.
