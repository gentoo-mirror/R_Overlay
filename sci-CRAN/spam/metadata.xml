		SPArse Matrix // Set of functions for sparse matrix algebra.
		Differences with other sparse matrix packages are: (1) we only
		support (essentially) one sparse matrix format, (2) based on
		transparent and simple structure(s), (3) tailored for MCMC
		calculations within G(M)RF. (4) and it is fast and scalable
		(with the extension package spam64). Documentation about 'spam'
		is provided by vignettes included in this package, see also
		Furrer and Sain (2010) doi:10.18637/jss.v036.i10; see
		'citation("spam")' for details.
