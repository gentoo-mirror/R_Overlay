		Implements Group Fused Multinomial Regression // Software to
		implement methodology to preform automatic response category
		combinations in multinomial logistic regression. There are
		functions for both cross validation and AIC for model
		selection.  The method provides regression coefficient
		estimates that may be useful for better understanding the true
		probability distribution of multinomial logistic regression
		when category probabilities are similar. These methods are not
		recommended for a large number of predictor variables.
