		Standardize Dates in Different Formats or with Missing Data //
		There are many different formats dates are commonly represented
		with: the order of day, month, or year can differ, different
		separators ("-", "/", or whitespace) can be used, months can be
		numerical, names, or abbreviations and year given as two digits
		or four. 'datefixR' takes dates in all these different formats
		and converts them to R's built-in date class. If 'datefixR'
		cannot standardize a date, such as because it is too malformed,
		then the user is told which date cannot be standardized and the
		corresponding ID for the row. 'datefixR' also allows the
		imputation of missing days and months with user-controlled
		behavior.
