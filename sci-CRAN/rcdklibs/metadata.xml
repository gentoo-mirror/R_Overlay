		The CDK Libraries Packaged for R // An R interface to the
		Chemistry Development Kit, a Java library for chemoinformatics.
		Given the size of the library itself, this package is not
		expected to change very frequently. To make use of the CDK
		within R, it is suggested that you use the 'rcdk' package. Note
		that it is possible to directly interact with the CDK using
		'rJava'. However 'rcdk' exposes functionality in a more
		idiomatic way. The CDK library itself is released as LGPL and
		the sources can be obtained from https://github.com/cdk/cdk.
