		Making Optimal Matching Size-Scalable Using Optimal Calipers //
		Implements optimal matching with near-fine balance in large
		observational studies with the use of optimal calipers to get a
		sparse network. The caliper is optimal in the sense that it is
		as small as possible such that a matching exists. The main
		functions in the 'bigmatch' package are optcal() to find the
		optimal caliper, optconstant() to find the optimal number of
		nearest neighbors, and nfmatch() to find a near-fine balance
		match with a caliper and a restriction on the number of nearest
		neighbors. Yu, R., Silber, J. H., and Rosenbaum, P. R. (2020).
