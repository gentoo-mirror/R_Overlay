		Add Loading Animations to a 'shiny' Output While It's
		Recalculating // When a 'Shiny' output (such as a plot, table,
		map, etc.) is recalculating, it remains visible but gets greyed
		out. Using 'shinycssloaders', you can add a loading animation
		("spinner") to outputs instead. By wrapping a 'Shiny' output in
		'withSpinner()', a spinner will automatically appear while the
		output is recalculating. You can also manually show and hide
		the spinner, or add a full-page spinner to cover the entire
		page. See the demo online at
		https://daattali.com/shiny/shinycssloaders-demo/.
