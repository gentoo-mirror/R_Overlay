		Compare Two Data Frames and Summarise the Difference // Easy
		comparison of two tabular data objects in R. Specifically
		designed to show differences between two sets of data in a
		useful way that should make it easier to understand the
		differences, and if necessary, help you work out how to remedy
		them. Aims to offer a more useful output than all.equal() when
		your two data sets do not match, but isn't intended to replace
		all.equal() as a way to test for equality.
