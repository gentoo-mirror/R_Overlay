		Simplifies Pairwise Statistical Analyses // Pairwise group
		comparisons are often performed. While there are many packages
		that can perform these analyses, often it is the case that only
		a subset of comparisons are desired. 'SimplifyStats' performs
		pairwise comparisons and returns the results in a tidy fashion.
