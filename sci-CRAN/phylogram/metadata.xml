		Dendrograms for Evolutionary Analysis // Contains functions for
		importing and exporting 'dendrogram' objects in parenthetic
		text format, and several functions for command-line tree
		manipulation. With an emphasis on speed and computational
		efficiency, the package also includes a suite of tools for
		rapidly computing distance matrices and building large trees
		using fast alignment-free 'k-mer' counting and divisive
		clustering techniques.
