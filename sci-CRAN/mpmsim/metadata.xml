		Simulation of Matrix Population Models with Defined Life History
		Characteristics // Allows users to simulate matrix population
		models with particular characteristics based on aspects of life
		history such as mortality trajectories and fertility
		trajectories. Also allows the exploration of sampling error due
		to small sample size.
