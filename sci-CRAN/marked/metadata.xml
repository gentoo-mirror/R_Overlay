		Mark-Recapture Analysis for Survival and Abundance Estimation //
		Functions for fitting various models to capture-recapture data
		including mixed-effects Cormack-Jolly-Seber(CJS) and multistate
		models and the multi-variate state model structure for survival
		estimation and POPAN structured Jolly-Seber models for
		abundance estimation. There are also Hidden Markov model (HMM)
		implementations of CJS and multistate models with and without
		state uncertainty and a simulation capability for HMM models.
