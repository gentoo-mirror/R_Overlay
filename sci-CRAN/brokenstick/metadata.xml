		Broken Stick Model for Irregular Longitudinal Data // The broken
		stick model describes a set of individual curves by a linear
		mixed model using a second-order linear B-spline. The main use
		of the model is to align irregularly observed data to a user-
		specified grid of break ages. All fitting can done in the
		Z-score scale, so non-linearity and irregular data can be
		treated as separate problems. This package contains functions
		for fitting a broken stick model to data, for predicting broken
		stick curves in new data, and for plotting the broken stick
		estimates. For additional documentation on background,
		methodology and applications of the broken stick model see http
		s://stefvanbuuren.name/publications/2020_Brokenstick_JSS_manusc
		ript.pdf.
