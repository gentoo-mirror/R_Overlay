		Broken Stick Model for Irregular Longitudinal Data // Data on
		multiple individuals through time are often sampled at times
		that differ between persons. Irregular observation times can
		severely complicate the statistical analysis of the data. The
		broken stick model approximates each subjects trajectory by one
		or more connected line segments. The times at which segments
		connect (breakpoints) are identical for all subjects and under
		control of the user. A well-fitting broken stick model
		effectively transforms individual measurements made at
		irregular times into regular trajectories with common
		observation times. Specification of the model requires three
		variables: time, measurement and subject. The model is a
		special case of the linear mixed model, with time as a linear
		B-spline and subject as the grouping factor. The main
		assumptions are: subjects are exchangeable, trajectories
		between consecutive breakpoints are straight, random effects
		follow a multivariate normal distribution, and unobserved data
		are missing at random. The package contains functions for
		fitting the broken stick model to data, for predicting curves
		in new data and for plotting broken stick estimates. The
		package supports two optimization methods, and includes options
		to structure the variance-covariance matrix of the random
		effects. The analyst may use the software to smooth growth
		curves by a series of connected straight lines, to align
		irregularly observed curves to a common time grid, to create
		synthetic curves at a user-specified set of breakpoints, to
		estimate the time-to-time correlation matrix and to predict
		future observations. See doi:10.18637/jss.v106.i07 for
		additional documentation on background, methodology and
		applications.
