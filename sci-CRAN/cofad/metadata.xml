		Contrast Analyses for Factorial Designs // Contrast analysis for
		factorial designs provides an alternative to the traditional
		ANOVA approach, offering the distinct advantage of testing
		targeted hypotheses. The foundation of this package is
		primarily rooted in the works of Rosenthal, Rosnow, and Rubin
		(2000, ISBN: 978-0521659802) as well as Sedlmeier and Renkewitz
		(2018, ISBN: 978-3868943214).
