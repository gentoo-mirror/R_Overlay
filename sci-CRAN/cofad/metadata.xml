		Contrast Analyses for Factorial Designs // Contrast analysis for
		factorial designs is an alternative to the classical ANOVA
		approach with the advantage of testing focused hypothesis. The
		method is mainly based on Rosenthal, Rosnow and Rubin (2000,
		ISBN:978-0521659802) and Sedlmeier and Renkewitz (2018,
		ISBN:978-3868943214).
