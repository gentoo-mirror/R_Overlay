		Models for Continuous Traits Evolving in Macroevolutionary
		Landscapes of any Shape // Provides a set of functions to fit
		general macroevolutionary models for continuous traits evolving
		in adaptive landscapes of any shape. This package implements
		the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov model (FPK), in which the trait
		evolves under random diffusion but is also subject to a force
		that pulls it towards specific values - this force can be of
		any shape. FPK has a version in which hard reflective bounds
		exist at the extremes of the trait interval: this second model
		is called BBMV.
