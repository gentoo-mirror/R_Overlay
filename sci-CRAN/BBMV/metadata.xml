		Models for Continuous Traits Evolving in Macroevolutionary
		Landscapes of any Shape // Provides a set of functions to fit
		general macroevolutionary models for continuous traits evolving
		in adaptive landscapes of any shape. The model is based on
		bounded Brownian motion (BBM), in which a continuous trait
		evolves along a phylogenetic tree under constant-rate diffusion
		between two reflective bounds. In addition to this random
		component, the trait evolves in a potential and is thus subject
		to a force that pulls it towards specific values - this force
		can be of any shape.
