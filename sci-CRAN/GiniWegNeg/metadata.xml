		Computing the Gini Coefficient for Weighted and Negative
		Attributes // Computation of the Gini coefficient in the
		presence of weighted and/or negative attributes. Two different
		approaches are considered in order to fulfill, in the case of
		negative attributes, the normalization principle, that is a
		value of the Gini coefficient bounded into the close range
		[0,1]. The first approach is based on the proposal by Chen,
		Tsaur and Rhai (1982) and Berebbi and Silber (1985), while the
		second approach is based on a recent proposal by Raffinetti,
		Siletti and Vernizzi (2015). The plot of the curve of maximum
		inequality, defined in the contribution of Raffinetti, Siletti
		and Vernizzi (2015), is provided.
