		Marginal Mediation Effects with Zero-Inflated Compositional
		Mediator // A way to estimate and test marginal mediation
		effects for zero-inflated compositional mediators. Estimates of
		Natural Indirect Effect (NIE), Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of
		each taxon, as well as their standard errors and confident
		intervals, were provided as outputs. Zeros will not be imputed
		during analysis. See Wu et al. (2022)
