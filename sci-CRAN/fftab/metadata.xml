		Tidy Manipulation of Fourier Transformed Data // The 'fftab'
		package stores Fourier coefficients in a tibble and allows
		their manipulation in various ways. Functions are available for
		converting between complex, rectangular ('re', 'im'), and polar
		('mod', 'arg') representations, as well as for extracting
		components as vectors or matrices. Inputs can include vectors,
		time series, and arrays of arbitrary dimensions, which are
		restored to their original form when inverting the transform.
		Since 'fftab' stores Fourier frequencies as columns in the
		tibble, many standard operations on spectral data can be easily
		performed using tidy packages like 'dplyr'.
