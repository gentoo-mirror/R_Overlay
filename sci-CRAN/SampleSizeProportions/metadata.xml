		Calculating Sample Size Requirements when Estimating the
		Difference Between Two Binomial Proportions // Sample size
		requirements calculation using three different Bayesian
		criteria in the context of designing an experiment to estimate
		the difference between two binomial proportions. Functions for
		calculation of required sample sizes for the Average Length
		Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion and the Worst Outcome
		Criterion in the context of binomial observations are provided.
		In all cases, estimation of the difference between two binomial
		proportions is considered. Functions for both the fully
		Bayesian and the mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches are
		provided. For reference see Joseph L., du Berger R. and
		B\'elisle P. (1997)
