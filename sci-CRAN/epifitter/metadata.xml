		Analysis and Simulation of Plant Disease Progress Curves //
		Analysis and visualization of plant disease progress curve
		data. Functions for fitting two-parameter population dynamics
		models (exponential, monomolecular, logistic and Gompertz) to
		proportion data for single or multiple epidemics using either
		linear or no-linear regression.  Statistical and visual outputs
		are provided to aid in model selection. Synthetic curves can be
		simulated for any of the models given the parameters. See
		Laurence V. Madden, Gareth Hughes, and Frank van den Bosch
		(2007) doi:10.1094/9780890545058 for further information on the
		methods.
