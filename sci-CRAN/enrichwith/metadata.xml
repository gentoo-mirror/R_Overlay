		Methods to Enrich R Objects with Extra Components // Provides the
		"enrich" method to enrich list-like R objects with new,
		relevant components. The current version has methods for
		enriching objects of class 'family', 'link-glm', 'lm' and
		'glm'. The resulting objects preserve their class, so all
		methods associated with them still apply. The package also
		provides the 'enriched_glm' function that has the same
		interface as 'glm' but results in objects of class
		'enriched_glm'. In addition to the usual components in a `glm`
		object, 'enriched_glm' objects carry an object-specific
		simulate method and functions to compute the scores, the
		observed and expected information matrix, the first-order bias,
		as well as model densities, probabilities, and quantiles at
		arbitrary parameter values. The package can also be used to
		produce customizable source code templates for the structured
		implementation of methods to compute new components and enrich
		arbitrary objects.
