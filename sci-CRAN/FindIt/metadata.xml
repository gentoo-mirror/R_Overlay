		Finding Heterogeneous Treatment Effects // The heterogeneous
		treatment effect estimation procedure proposed by Imai and
		Ratkovic (2013)DOI: 10.1214/12-AOAS593. The proposed method is
		applicable, for example, when selecting a small number of most
		(or least) efficacious treatments from a large number of
		alternative treatments as well as when identifying subsets of
		the population who benefit (or are harmed by) a treatment of
		interest. The method adapts the Support Vector Machine
		classifier by placing separate LASSO constraints over the pre-
		treatment parameters and causal heterogeneity parameters of
		interest. This allows for the qualitative distinction between
		causal and other parameters, thereby making the variable
		selection suitable for the exploration of causal heterogeneity.
		The package also contains a class of functions, CausalANOVA,
		which estimates the average marginal interaction effects
		(AMIEs) by a regularized ANOVA as proposed by Egami and Imai
		(2019). It contains a variety of regularization techniques to
		facilitate analysis of large factorial experiments.
