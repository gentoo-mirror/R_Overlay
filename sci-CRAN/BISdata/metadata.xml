		Download Data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
		// Functions for downloading data from the Bank for
		International Settlements (BIS; https://www.bis.org/) in Basel.
		Supported are only full datasets in (typically) CSV format.
		The package is lightweight and without dependencies; suggested
		packages are used only if data is to be transformed into
		particular data structures, for instance into 'zoo' objects.
		Downloaded data can optionally be cached, to avoid repeated
		downloads of the same files.
