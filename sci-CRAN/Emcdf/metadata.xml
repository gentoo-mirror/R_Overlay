		Computation and Visualization of Empirical Joint Distribution
		(Empirical Joint CDF) // Computes and visualizes empirical
		joint distribution of multivariate data with optimized
		algorithms and multi-thread computation. There is a faster
		algorithm using dynamic programming to compute the whole
		empirical joint distribution of a bivariate data. There are
		optimized algorithms for computing empirical joint CDF function
		values for other multivariate data. Visualization is focused on
		bivariate data. Levelplots and wireframes are included.
