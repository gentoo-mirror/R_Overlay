		Compute and Decompose Inequality in Education // Easily compute
		education inequality measures and the distribution of
		educational attainments for any group of countries, using the
		data set developed in Jorda, V. and Alonso, JM. (2017)
		DOI:10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.10.005. The package offers the
		possibility to compute not only the Gini index, but also
		generalized entropy measures for different values of the
		sensitivity parameter. In particular, the package includes
		functions to compute the mean log deviation, which is more
		sensitive to the bottom part of the distribution; the Theils
		entropy measure, equally sensitive to all parts of the
		distribution; and finally, the GE measure when the sensitivity
		parameter is set equal to 2, which gives more weight to
		differences in higher education. The decomposition of these
		measures in the components between-country and within-country
		inequality is also provided. Two graphical tools are also
		provided, to analyse the evolution of the distribution of
		educational attainments: The cumulative distribution function
		and the Lorenz curve.
