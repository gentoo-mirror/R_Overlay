		Compute Expected Shortfall and Value at Risk for Continuous
		Distributions // Compute expected shortfall (ES) and Value at
		Risk (VaR) from a quantile function, distribution function,
		random number generator or probability density function.  ES is
		also known as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Virtually any
		continuous distribution can be specified. The functions are
		vectorized over the arguments. The computations are done
		directly from the definitions, see e.g. Acerbi and Tasche
		(2002) doi:10.1111/1468-0300.00091.
