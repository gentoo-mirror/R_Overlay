		Web Application to Run Meta-Analyses // Shiny web application to
		run meta-analyses. Essentially a graphical front-end to package
		'meta' for R. Can be useful as an educational tool, and for
		quickly analyzing and sharing meta-analyses. Provides output to
		quickly fill in GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
		Development and Evaluations) Summary-of-Findings tables.
		Importantly, it allows further processing of the results inside
		R, in case more specific analyses are needed.
