		Spatio-Temporal Functional Imputation Tool // A general
		spatiotemporal satellite image imputation method based on
		sparse functional data analytic techniques. The imputation
		method applies and extends the Functional Principal Analysis by
		Conditional Estimation (PACE). The underlying idea for the
		proposed procedure is to impute a missing pixel by borrowing
		information from temporally and spatially contiguous pixels
		based on the best linear unbiased prediction.
