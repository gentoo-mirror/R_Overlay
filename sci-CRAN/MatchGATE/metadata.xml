		Estimate Group Average Treatment Effects with Matching // Two
		novel matching-based methods for estimating group average
		treatment effects (GATEs). The match_y1y0() and match_y1y0_bc()
		functions are used for imputing the potential outcomes based on
		matching and bias-corrected matching techniques, respectively.
		The EstGATE() function is employed to estimate the GATE after
		imputing the potential outcomes.
