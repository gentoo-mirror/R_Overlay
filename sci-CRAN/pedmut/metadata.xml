		Mutation Models for Pedigree Likelihood Computations // A
		collection of functions for modelling mutations in pedigrees
		with marker data, as used e.g. in likelihood computations with
		microsatellite data.  Implemented models include proportional
		and stepwise models, as well as random models for experimental
		work, and custom models allowing the user to apply any valid
		mutation matrix. Allele lumping is done following the
		lumpability criteria of Kemeny and Snell (1976),
		ISBN:0387901922.
