		'Rcpp' Meets 'C++' Arrays // Interoperability between 'Rcpp' and
		the 'C++11' array and tuple types. Linking to this package
		allows fixed-length 'std::array' objects to be converted to and
		from equivalent R vectors, and 'std::tuple' objects converted
		to lists, via the as() and wrap() functions. There is also
		experimental support for 'std::span' from 'C++20'.
