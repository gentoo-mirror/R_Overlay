		Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease Dynamics // Tools for
		simulating mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics.
		Epidemic model classes include deterministic compartmental
		models, stochastic agent-based models, and stochastic network
		models. Network models use the robust statistical methods of
		exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) from the Statnet
		suite of software packages in R. Standard templates for
		epidemic modeling include SI, SIR, and SIS disease types.
		EpiModel features an easy API for extending these templates to
		address novel scientific research aims.
