		Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease // Tools for
		simulating mathematical models of infectious disease. Epidemic
		model classes include deterministic compartmental models,
		stochastic agent-based, and stochastic network models. Network
		models use robust statistical methods of exponential-family
		random graph models (ERGMs) from the Statnet suite of software
		packages in R. Standard templates for epidemic modeling include
		SI, SIR, and SIS disease types. EpiModel features an easy API
		for extending these templates to address novel scientific
		research aims.
