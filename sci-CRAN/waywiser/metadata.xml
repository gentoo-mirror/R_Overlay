		Methods for Assessing Spatial Models // Assessing predictive
		models of spatial data can be challenging, both because these
		models are typically built for extrapolating outside the
		original region represented by training data and due to
		potential spatially structured errors, with "hot spots" of
		higher than expected error clustered geographically due to
		spatial structure in the underlying data. These functions
		provide methods for measuring the spatial structure of model
		errors and evaluating where predictions can be made safely, and
		are particularly useful for models fit using the 'tidymodels'
		framework. Methods include Moran's I ('Moran' (1950)
		doi:10.2307/2332142), Geary's C ('Geary' (1954)
		doi:10.2307/2986645), Getis-Ord's G ('Ord' and 'Getis' (1995)
		doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x), as well as an
		implementation of the area of applicability methodology from
		'Meyer' and 'Pebesma' (2021) (doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13650).
