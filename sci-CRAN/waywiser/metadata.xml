		Ergonomic Methods for Assessing Spatial Models // Assessing
		predictive models of spatial data can be challenging, both
		because these models are typically built for extrapolating
		outside the original region represented by training data and
		due to potential spatially structured errors, with "hot spots"
		of higher than expected error clustered geographically due to
		spatial structure in the underlying data. Methods are provided
		for assessing models fit to spatial data, including approaches
		for measuring the spatial structure of model errors, assessing
		model predictions at multiple spatial scales, and evaluating
		where predictions can be made safely. Methods are particularly
		useful for models fit using the 'tidymodels' framework. Methods
		include Moran's I ('Moran' (1950) doi:10.2307/2332142), Geary's
		C ('Geary' (1954) doi:10.2307/2986645), Getis-Ord's G ('Ord'
		and 'Getis' (1995) doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x),
		agreement coefficients from 'Ji' and Gallo (2006) (doi:
		10.14358/PERS.72.7.823), agreement metrics from 'Willmott'
		(1981) (doi: 10.1080/02723646.1981.10642213) and 'Willmott'
		'et' 'al'. (2012) (doi: 10.1002/joc.2419), an implementation of
		the area of applicability methodology from 'Meyer' and
		'Pebesma' (2021) (doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13650), and an
		implementation of multi-scale assessment as described in
		'Riemann' 'et' 'al'. (2010) (doi:10.1016/j.rse.2010.05.010).
