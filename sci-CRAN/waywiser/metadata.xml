		Yardstick Extensions for Measuring Spatial Structure in Model
		Residuals // Predictive models of spatial data may have
		spatially structured errors, with "hot spots" of higher than
		expected error clustered geographically due to spatial
		structure in the underlying data. These functions provide
		methods for measuring the spatial structure of model errors for
		models, and are particularly useful for models fit using the
		'tidymodels' framework. Methods include Moran's I ('Moran'
		(1950) doi:10.2307/2332142), Geary's C ('Geary' (1954)
		doi:10.2307/2986645) and Getis-Ord's G ('Ord' and 'Getis'
		(1995) doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x).
