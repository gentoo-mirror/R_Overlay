		Use Known Groups in High-Dimensional Data to Derive Scores for
		Plots // Cross-validated linear discriminant calculations
		determine the optimum number of features. Test and training
		scores from successive cross-validation steps determine, via a
		principal components calculation, a low-dimensional global
		space onto which test scores are projected, in order to plot
		them. Further functions are included that serve didactic
		purposes.
