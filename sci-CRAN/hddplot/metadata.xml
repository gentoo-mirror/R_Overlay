		Use Known Groups in High-Dimensional Data to Derive Scores for
		Plots // Cross-validated linear discriminant calculations
		determine the optimum number of features. Test and training
		scores from successive cross-validation steps determine, via a
		principal components calculation, a low-dimensional global
		space onto which test scores are projected, in order to plot
		them. Further functions are included that are intended for
		didactic use. The  package implements, and extends, methods
		described in J.H. Maindonald and C.J. Burden (2005)
