		Umbrella Review Package for R // A comprehensive range of
		facilities to perform umbrella reviews with stratification of
		the evidence in R. The package accomplishes this aim by
		building on three core functions that: (i) automatically
		perform all required calculations (including but not limited to
		meta-analyses), (ii) stratify evidence according to various
		criteria, and (iii) generate a visual representation of the
		results. Note that if you are not familiar with R, the core
		features of this package are available from a web browser
		(https://www.metaumbrella.org/).
