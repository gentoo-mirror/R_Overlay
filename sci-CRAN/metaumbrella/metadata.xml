		Umbrella Review Package for R // A comprehensive range of
		facilities to perform umbrella reviews with stratification of
		the evidence in R. The package accomplishes this aim by
		building on three core functions that: (i) automatically
		perform all required calculations in an umbrella review
		(including but not limited to meta-analyses), (ii) stratify
		evidence according to various classification criteria, and
		(iii) generate a visual representation of the results. Note
		that if you are not familiar with R, the core features of this
		package are available from a web browser
		(https://www.metaumbrella.org/).
