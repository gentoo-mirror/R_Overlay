		Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform // The synchrosqueezed wavelet
		transform is implemented. The package is a translation of
		MATLAB Synchrosqueezing Toolbox, version 1.1 originally
		developed by Eugene Brevdo (2012). The C code for curve_ext was
		authored by Jianfeng Lu, and translated to Fortran by Dongik
		Jang. Synchrosqueezing is based on the papers: [1] Daubechies,
		I., Lu, J. and Wu, H. T. (2011) Synchrosqueezed wavelet
		transforms: An empirical mode decomposition-like tool. Applied
		and Computational Harmonic Analysis, 30. 243-261. [2] Thakur,
		G., Brevdo, E., Fukar, N. S. and Wu, H-T. (2013) The
		Synchrosqueezing algorithm for time-varying spectral analysis:
		Robustness properties and new paleoclimate applications. Signal
		Processing, 93, 1079-1094.
