		Spatial Analysis with Self-Organizing Maps // Application of the
		Self-Organizing Maps technique for spatial classification of
		time series. The package uses spatial data, point or gridded,
		to create clusters with similar characteristics. The clusters
		can be further refined to a smaller number of regions by
		hierarchical clustering and their spatial dependencies can be
		presented as complex networks. Thus, meaningful maps can be
		created, representing the regional heterogeneity of a single
		variable. More information and an example of implementation can
		be found in Markonis and Strnad (2020,
		doi:10.1177/0959683620913924).
