		Construct Measurement Evaluation Tool // With this package you
		can run 'ConMET' locally in R. 'ConMET' is an R-shiny
		application that facilitates performing and evaluating
		confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) and is useful for running
		and reporting typical measurement models in applied psychology
		and management journals. 'ConMET' automatically creates,
		compares and summarizes CFA models. Most common fit indices
		(E.g., CFI and SRMR) are put in an overview table. ConMET also
		allows to test for common method variance. The application is
		particularly useful for teaching and instruction of measurement
		issues in survey research. The application uses the 'lavaan'
		package (Rosseel, 2012) to run CFAs.
