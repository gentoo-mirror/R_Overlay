		Reading, Formatting, and Organizing the Panel Study of Income
		Dynamics (PSID) // Provides various functions for reading and
		preparing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for
		longitudinal analysis, including functions that read the PSID's
		fixed width format files directly into R, rename all of the
		PSID's longitudinal variables so that recurring variables have
		consistent names across years, simplify assembling longitudinal
		datasets from cross sections of the PSID Family Files, and
		export the resulting PSID files into file formats common among
		other statistical programming languages ('SAS', 'STATA', and
		'SPSS').
