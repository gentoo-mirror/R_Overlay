		Estimate and Simulate from Location Dependent Marked Point
		Processes // A suite of tools for estimating, assessing model
		fit, simulating from, and visualizing location dependent marked
		point processes characterized by regularity in the pattern. You
		provide a reference marked point process, a set of raster
		images containing location specific covariates, and select the
		estimation algorithm and type of mark model. 'ldmppr' estimates
		the process and mark models and allows you to check the
		appropriateness of the model using a variety of diagnostic
		tools. Once a satisfactory model fit is obtained, you can
		simulate from the model and visualize the results.
		Documentation for the package 'ldmppr' is available in the form
		of a vignette.
