		Robust Exponential Factor Analysis // A robust alternative to the
		traditional principal component estimator is proposed within
		the framework of factor models, known as Robust Exponential
		Factor Analysis, specifically designed for the modeling of
		high-dimensional datasets with heavy-tailed distributions. The
		algorithm estimates the latent factors and the loading by
		minimizing the exponential squared loss function. To determine
		the appropriate number of factors, we propose a modified rank
		minimization technique, which has been shown to significantly
		enhance finite-sample performance.
