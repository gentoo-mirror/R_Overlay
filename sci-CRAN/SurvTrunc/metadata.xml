		Analysis of Doubly Truncated Data // Package performs Cox
		regression and survival distribution function estimation when
		the survival times are subject to double truncation. In case
		that the survival and truncation times are quasi-independent,
		the estimation procedure for each method involves inverse
		probability weighting, where the weights correspond to the
		inverse of the selection probabilities and are estimated using
		the survival times and truncation times only. A test for
		checking this independence assumption is also included in this
		package. The functions available in this package for Cox
		regression, survival distribution function estimation, and
		testing independence under double truncation are based on the
		following methods, respectively: Rennert and Xie (2018)
		doi:10.1111/biom.12809, Shen (2010)
		doi:10.1007/s10463-008-0192-2, Martin and Betensky (2005)
		doi:10.1198/016214504000001538. When the survival times are
		dependent on at least one of the truncation times, an EM
		algorithm is employed to obtain point estimates for the
		regression coefficients. The standard errors are calculated
		using the bootstrap method. See Rennert and Xie (2022)
		doi:10.1111/biom.13451. Both the independent and dependent
		cases assume no censoring is present in the data. Please
		contact Lior Rennert liorr@clemson.edu for questions regarding
		function coxDT and Yidan Shi yidan.shi@pennmedicine.upenn.edu
		for questions regarding function coxDTdep.
