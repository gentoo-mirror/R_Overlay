		Analysis of Doubly Truncated Data // Package performs Cox
		regression and survival distribution function estimation when
		the survival times are subject to double truncation. The
		estimation procedure for each method involves inverse
		probability weighting, where the weights correspond to the
		inverse of the selection probabilities and are estimated using
		the survival times and truncation times only. Both methods
		require that the survival and truncation times are quasi-
		independent. A test for checking this independence assumption
		is also included in this package. The functions available in
		this package for Cox regression, survival distribution function
		estimation, and testing independence under double truncation
		are based on the following methods, respectively: Rennert and
