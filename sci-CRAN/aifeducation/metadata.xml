		Artificial Intelligence for Education // In social and
		educational settings, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
		is a challenging task. Relevant data is often only available in
		handwritten forms or the use of data is restricted by privacy
		policies, often leading to small data sets. Furthermore, data
		in the educational and social sciences is often unbalanced in
		terms of frequencies. To support educators as well as
		educational and social researchers in using the potentials of
		AI for their work, this package provides a unified interface
		for neural nets in 'keras', 'tensorflow', and 'pytorch' to deal
		with natural language problems. The tools integrate existing
		mathematical and statistical methods for dealing with small
		data sets via pseudo-labeling (e.g. Lee (2013)
		https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280581078_Pseudo-
		Label_The_Simple_and_Efficient_Semi-
		Supervised_Learning_Method_for_Deep_Neural_Networks, Cascante-
		Bonilla et al. (2020) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2001.06001) and
		imbalanced data via the creation of synthetic cases (e.g.
		Bunkhumpornpat et al. (2012) doi:10.1007/s10489-011-0287-y).
		Performance evaluation of AI is connected to measures from
		content analysis which educational and social researchers are
		generally more familiar with (e.g. Berding  Pargmann (2022)
		doi:10.30819/5581, Gwet (2014) ISBN:978-0-9708062-8-4,
		Krippendorff (2019) doi:10.4135/9781071878781). Estimation of
		energy consumption and CO2 emissions during training models is
		done with the 'python' library 'codecarbon'.  Finally, all
		objects created with this package allow to share trained AI
		with other people.
