		Bayesian Logistic Regression with Heavy-Tailed Priors //
		Efficient Bayesian multinomial logistic regression based on
		heavy-tailed (hyper-LASSO, non-convex) priors. The posterior of
		coefficients and hyper-parameters is sampled with restricted
		Gibbs sampling for leveraging the high-dimensionality and
		Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling the high-correlation among
		coefficients. A detailed description of the method: Li and Yao
		(2018), Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,
		88:14, 2827-2851, arXiv:1405.3319.
