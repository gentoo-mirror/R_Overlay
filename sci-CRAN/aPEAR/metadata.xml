		Advanced Pathway Enrichment Analysis Representation // Simplify
		pathway enrichment analysis results by detecting clusters of
		similar pathways and visualizing it as an enrichment network,
		where nodes and edges describe the pathways and similarity
		between them, respectively. This reduces the redundancy of the
		overlapping pathways and helps to notice the most important
		biological themes in the data (Kerseviciute and Gordevicius
		(2023) doi:10.1101/2023.03.28.534514).
