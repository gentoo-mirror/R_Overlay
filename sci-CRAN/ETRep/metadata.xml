		Analysis of Elliptical Tubes Under the Relative Curvature
		Condition // Analysis of elliptical tubes with applications in
		biological modeling. The package is based on the references:
		Taheri, M., Pizer, S. M.,  Schulz, J. (2024) "The Mean Shape
		under the Relative Curvature Condition." arXiv
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.01043. Mohsen Taheri Shalmani (2024)
		"Shape Statistics via Skeletal Structures", PhD Thesis,
		University of Stavanger, Norway
		doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.34500.23685. Key features include
		constructing discrete elliptical tubes, calculating
		transformations, validating structures under the Relative
		Curvature Condition (RCC), computing means, and generating
		simulations. Supports intrinsic and non-intrinsic mean
		calculations and transformations, size estimation, plotting,
		and random sample generation based on a reference tube. The
		intrinsic approach relies on the interior path of the original
		non-convex space, incorporating the RCC, while the non-
		intrinsic approach uses a basic robotic arm transformation that
		disregards the RCC.
