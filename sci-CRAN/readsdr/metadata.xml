		Translate Models from System Dynamics Software into 'R' // The
		goal of 'readsdr' is to bridge the design capabilities from
		specialised System Dynamics software with the powerful
		numerical tools offered by 'R' libraries. The package
		accomplishes this goal by parsing 'XMILE' files ('Vensim' and
		'Stella') models into 'R' objects to construct networks (graph
		theory); 'ODE' functions for 'Stan'; and inputs to simulate via
		'deSolve' as described in Duggan (2016)
