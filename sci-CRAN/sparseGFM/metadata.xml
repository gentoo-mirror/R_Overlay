		Sparse Generalized Factor Models with Multiple Penalty Functions
		// Implements sparse generalized factor models (sparseGFM) for
		dimension reduction and variable selection in high-dimensional
		data with automatic adaptation to weak factor scenarios. The
		package supports multiple data types (continuous, count,
		binary) through generalized linear model frameworks and handles
		missing values automatically. It provides 12 different penalty
		functions including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
		Operator (Lasso), adaptive Lasso, Smoothly Clipped Absolute
		Deviation (SCAD), Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), group Lasso,
		and their adaptive versions for inducing row-wise sparsity in
		factor loadings. Key features include cross-validation for
		regularization parameter selection using Sparsity Information
		Criterion (SIC), automatic determination of the number of
		factors via multiple information criteria, and specialized
		algorithms for row-sparse loading structures. The methodology
		employs alternating minimization with Singular Value
		Decomposition (SVD)-based identifiability constraints and is
		particularly effective for high-dimensional applications in
		genomics, economics, and social sciences where interpretable
		sparse dimension reduction is crucial. For penalty functions,
		see Tibshirani (1996) doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02080.x,
		Fan and Li (2001) doi:10.1198/016214501753382273, and Zhang
		(2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOS729.
