		Estimation Methods for Markets in Equilibrium and Disequilibrium
		// Provides estimation methods for markets in equilibrium and
		disequilibrium. Supports the estimation of an equilibrium and
		four disequilibrium models with both correlated and independent
		shocks. Also provides post-estimation analysis tools, such as
		aggregation, marginal effect, and shortage calculations. See
		Karapanagiotis (2024) doi:10.18637/jss.v108.i02 for an overview
		of the functionality and examples. The estimation methods are
		based on full information maximum likelihood techniques given
		in Maddala and Nelson (1974) doi:10.2307/1914215. They are
		implemented using the analytic derivative expressions
		calculated in Karapanagiotis (2020) doi:10.2139/ssrn.3525622.
		Standard errors can be estimated by adjusting for
		heteroscedasticity or clustering. The equilibrium estimation
		constitutes a case of a system of linear, simultaneous
		equations. Instead, the disequilibrium models replace the
		market-clearing condition with a non-linear, short-side rule
		and allow for different specifications of price dynamics.
