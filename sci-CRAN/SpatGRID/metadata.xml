		Spatial Grid Generation from Longitude and Latitude List // The
		developed function is designed for the generation of spatial
		grids based on user-specified longitude and latitude
		coordinates. The function first validates the input longitude
		and latitude values, ensuring they fall within the appropriate
		geographic ranges. It then creates a polygon from the
		coordinates and determines the appropriate Universal Transverse
		Mercator zone based on the provided hemisphere and longitude
		values. Subsequently, transforming the input Shapefile to the
		Universal Transverse Mercator projection when necessary.
		Finally, a spatial grid is generated with the specified
		interval and saved as a Shapefile. For method details see,
		Brus,D.J.(2022).DOI:10.1201/9781003258940. The function takes
		into account crucial parameters such as the hemisphere (north
		or south), desired grid interval, and the output Shapefile
		path. The developed function is an efficient tool, simplifying
		the process of empty spatial grid generation for applications
		such as, geo-statistical analysis, digital soil mapping product
		generation, etc. Whether for environmental studies, urban
		planning, or any other geo-spatial analysis, this package
		caters to the diverse needs of users working with spatial data,
		enhancing the accessibility and ease of spatial data processing
		and visualization.
