		Nonparametric Estimation and Inference on Dose-Response Curves //
		A novel integral estimator for estimating the causal effects
		with continuous treatments (or dose-response curves) and a
		localized derivative estimator for estimating the derivative
		effects. The inference on the dose-response curve and its
		derivative is conducted via nonparametric bootstrap. The
		reference paper is Zhang, Chen, and Giessing (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2405.09003.
