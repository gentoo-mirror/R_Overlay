		Nucleic Acid Melting Curve Analysis // Lightweight utilities for
		nucleic acid melting curve analysis are important in life
		sciences and diagnostics. This software can be used for the
		analysis and presentation of melting curve data from microbead-
		based assays (surface melting curve analysis) and reactions in
		solution (e.g., quantitative PCR (qPCR), real-time isothermal
		Amplification). Further information are described in detail in
		two publications in The R Journal [

		schimke.pdf;
