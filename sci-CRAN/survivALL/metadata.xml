		Continuous Biomarker Assessment by Exhaustive Survival Analysis
		// In routine practice, biomarker performance is calculated by
		splitting a patient cohort at some arbitrary level, often by
		median gene expression. The logic behind this is to divide
		patients into high or low expression groups that in turn
		correlate with either good or poor prognosis. However, this
		median-split approach assumes that the data set composition
		adheres to a strict 1:1 proportion of high vs. low expression,
		that for every one low there is an equivalent high. In reality,
		data sets are often heterogeneous in their composition (Perou,
		CM et al., 2000 doi:10.1038/35021093)- i.e. this 1:1
		relationship is unlikely to exist and the true relationship
		unknown. Given this limitation, it remains difficult to
		determine where the most significant separation should be made.
		For example, estrogen receptor (ER) status determined by
		immunohistochemistry is standard practice in predicting hormone
		therapy response, where ER is found in an ~1:3 ratio (-:+) in
		the populationi (Selli, C et al., 2016
		doi:10.1186/s13058-016-0779-0). We would expect therefore, upon
		dividing patients by ER expression, 25% to be classified low
		and 75% high, and an otherwise 50-50 split to incorrectly
		classify 25% of our patient cohort, rendering our survival
		estimate under powered. 'survivALL' is a data-driven approach
		to calculate the relative survival estimates for all possible
		points of separation - i.e. at all possible ratios of high vs.
		low - allowing a measures relationship with survival to be more
		reliably determined and quantified. We see this as a solution
		to a flaw in common research practice, namely the failure of a
		true biomarker as part of a meta-analysis.
