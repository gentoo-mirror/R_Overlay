		Empirical Mode Decomposition for Cyclostratigraphy // Tools to
		apply Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) for
		cyclostratigraphy purposes. Mainly: a new algorithm, extricate,
		that performs EEMD in seconds, a linear interpolation algorithm
		using the greatest rational common divisor of depth or time,
		different algorithms to compute instantaneous amplitude,
		frequency and ratios of frequencies, and functions to verify
		and visualise the outputs. The functions were developed during
		the CRASH project (Checking the Reproducibility of
		Astrochronology in the Hauterivian). When using for publication
		please cite Wouters, S., Crucifix, M., Sinnesael, M., Da Silva,
		A.C., Zeeden, C., Zivanovic, M., Boulvain, F., Devleeschouwer,
		X., 2022, "A decomposition approach to cyclostratigraphic
		signal processing". Earth-Science Reviews 225 (103894).
