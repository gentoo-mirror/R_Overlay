		A Collection of Useful Functions by John // A set of general
		functions that I have used in various projects and in other R
		packages. They support some miscellaneous operations on data
		frames, matrices and vectors: adding a row on a ternary
		(3-value) data.frame based on positive and negative vector-
		indicators, rearranging a list of data.frames by rownames,
		pruning rows or columns of a data.frame that contain only one
		specific value given by the user, checking for matrix equality,
		pruning and reordering a vector according to the common
		elements between its names and elements of another given
		vector, finding the non-common elements between two vectors
		(outer-section), normalization of a vector, matrix or
		data.frame's numeric values in a specified range, pretty
		printing of vector names and values in an R notebook (common
		names and values between two vectors also supported),
		retrieving the parent directory of any string path, checking
		whether a numeric value is inside a given interval, trim the
		decimal points of a given numeric value, quick saving of data
		to a file, making a multiple densities plot and a color bar
		plot and executing a plot string expression while generating
		the result to the specified file format.
