		A Collection of Useful Functions by John // A set of general
		functions that I have used in various projects and in other R
		packages. They support some miscellaneous operations on data
		frames, matrices and vectors like adding a row on a ternary
		(3-value) data.frame based on positive and negative vector-
		indicators, rearranging a list of data.frames by rownames,
		pruning rows or columns of a data.frame that contain only one
		specific value given by the user, pruning and reordering a
		vector according to the common elements between its names and
		elements of another given vector, finding the non-common
		elements between two vectors (outer-section), normalization of
		a vector, matrix or data.frame's numeric values in a specified
		range, pretty printing of vector names and values in an R
		Markdown document. Also included is a function that returns the
		statistics needed for plotting a ROC curve.
