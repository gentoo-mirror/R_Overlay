		Trends and Indices for Monitoring Data // The TRIM model is
		widely used for estimating growth and decline of animal
		populations based on (possibly sparsely available) count data.
		The current package is a reimplementation of the original TRIM
		software developed at Statistics Netherlands by Jeroen
		Pannekoek. See https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/society/nature-and-
		environment/indices-and-trends--trim-- for more information
