		Graphical Analysis of Structural Causal Models // A port of the
		web-based software 'DAGitty', available at http://dagitty.net,
		for analyzing structural causal models (also known as directed
		acyclic graphs or DAGs). This package computes covariate
		adjustment sets for estimating causal effects, enumerates
		instrumental variables, derives testable implications
		(d-separation and vanishing tetrads), generates equivalent
		models, and includes a simple facility for data simulation.
