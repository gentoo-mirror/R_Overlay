		Standard Methods for Use in Public Health Scotland // A
		collection of methods for commonly undertaken analytical tasks,
		primarily developed for Public Health Scotland (PHS) analysts,
		but the package is also generally useful to others working in
		the healthcare space, particularly since it has functions for
		working with Community Health Index (CHI) numbers. The package
		can help to make data manipulation and analysis more efficient
		and reproducible.
