		An Interface for Karstic Time Series // An R graphical user
		interface for karstic time series, based on the 'tcltk'
		package. Karstic research typically includes CO2 and 222Rn
		concentrations and microclimatic measurements. Many of these
		time series have a strong non-linear behavior. Gaps are often a
		significant problem because caves are aggressive environments
		for the measuring devices. 'KarsTS' provides linear and non-
		linear analysis (Marwan et al. (2007)
		10.1016/j.physrep.2006.11.001) and filling methods (Moffat et
		al. (2007) doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2007.08.011), as well as
		tools to manipulate easily time series and gap sets.
