		An Interface for Karstic Time Series // An R graphical user
		interface for karstic time series, based on the 'tcltk'
		package. Karstic research typically includes CO2 and Rn
		concentrations and microclimatic measurements. Many of these
		time series have a strong non-linear behavior. Gaps are often a
		significant problem because caves are aggressive environments
		for the apparels. 'KarsTS' provides linear and non-linear
		analysis and filling methods, as well as tools to manipulate
		easily time series and gap sets.
