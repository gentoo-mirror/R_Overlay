		Sensitivities of Prices of Financial Options and Implied
		Volatilities // Methods to calculate sensitivities of financial
		option prices for European, geometric and arithmetic Asian, and
		American options, with various payoff functions in the Black
		Scholes model, and in more general jump diffusion models. A
		shiny app to interactively plot the results is included.
		Furthermore, methods to compute implied volatilities are
		provided for a wide range of option types and  custom payoff
		functions. Classical formulas are implemented for European
		options in the Black Scholes Model, as is presented in Hull, J.
		C. (2017), Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives. In the case
		of Asian options, Malliavin Monte Carlo Greeks are implemented,
		see Hudde, A.  Rschendorf, L. (2023). European and Asian Greeks
		for exponential Lvy processes. doi:10.1007/s11009-023-10014-5.
		For American options, the Binomial Tree  Method is implemented,
		as is presented in Hull, J. C. (2017).
