		Sensitivities of Prices of Financial Options and Implied
		Volatilites // Methods to calculate sensitivities of financial
		option prices for European, Asian, American and Digital Options
		options in the Black Scholes model, and in more general jump
		diffusion models. A shiny app to interactively view plot the
		results is included. Furthermore, methods to compute implied
		volatilities are provided for a wide range of option types and
		custom payoff functions. Classical formulas are implemented for
		European options in the Black Scholes Model, as is presented in
		Hull, J. C. (2017). Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives,
		Global Edition (9th Edition). Pearson. In the case of Asian
		options, Malliavin Monte Carlo Greeks are implemented, see
		Hudde, A.  Rschendorf, L. (2016). European and Asian Greeks for
		exponential Lvy processes. arXiv:1603.00920. For American
		options, the Binomial Tree Method is implemented, as is
		presented in Hull, J. C. (2017).
