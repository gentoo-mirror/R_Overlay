		Modular Cohort-Building Framework for Analytical Dashboards //
		You can easily add advanced cohort-building component to your
		analytical dashboard or simple 'Shiny' app. Then you can
		instantly start building cohorts using multiple filters of
		different types, filtering datasets, and filtering steps.
		Filters can be complex and data-specific, and together with
		multiple filtering steps you can use complex filtering rules.
		The cohort-building sidebar panel allows you to easily work
		with filters, add and remove filtering steps. It helps you with
		handling missing values during filtering, and provides instant
		filtering feedback with filter feedback plots. The GUI panel is
		not only compatible with native shiny bookmarking, but also
		provides reproducible R code.
