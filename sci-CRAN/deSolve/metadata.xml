		Solvers for Initial Value Problems of Differential Equations
		('ODE', 'DAE', 'DDE') // Functions that solve initial value
		problems of a system of first-order ordinary differential
		equations ('ODE'), of partial differential equations ('PDE'),
		of differential algebraic equations ('DAE'), and of delay
		differential equations.  The functions provide an interface to
		the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of
		the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode',
		'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation of solvers of the
		'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time steps.  The
		package contains routines designed for solving 'ODEs' resulting
		from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial differential equations ('PDE')
		that have been converted to 'ODEs' by numerical differencing.
