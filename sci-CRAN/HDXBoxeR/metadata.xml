		Analysis of Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass-Spectrometry Data //
		A protocol that facilitates the processing and analysis of
		Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry data using
		p-value statistics and Critical Interval analysis. It provides
		a pipeline for analyzing data from 'HDXExaminer' (Sierra
		Analytics, Trajan Scientific), automating matching and
		comparison of protein states through Welch's T-test and the
		Critical Interval statistical framework. Additionally, it
		simplifies data export, generates 'Pymol' scripts, and ensures
		calculations meet publication standards. 'HDXBoxeR' assists in
		various aspects of hydrogen-deuterium exchange data analysis,
		including reprocessing data, calculating parameters,
		identifying significant peptides, generating plots, and
		facilitating comparison between protein states. For details
