		Variational Approximation for Joint Survival and Marker Models //
		Estimates joint marker (longitudinal) and and survival (time-
		to-event) outcomes using variational approximations. The
		package supports multivariate markers allowing for correlated
		error terms and multiple types of survival outcomes which may
		be left-truncated, right-censored, and recurrent. Time-varying
		fixed and random covariate effects are supported along with
		non-proportional hazards.
