		Kernel Measure of Multi-Sample Dissimilarity // Implementations
		of the kernel measure of multi-sample dissimilarity (KMD)
		between several samples using K-nearest neighbor graphs and
		minimum spanning trees. The KMD measures the dissimilarity
		between multiple samples, based on the observations from them.
		It converges to the population quantity (depending on the
		kernel) which is between 0 and 1. A small value indicates the
		multiple samples are from the same distribution, and a large
		value indicates the corresponding distributions are different.
		The population quantity is 0 if and only if all distributions
		are the same, and 1 if and only if all distributions are
		mutually singular. The package also implements the tests based
		on KMD for H0: the M distributions are equal against H1: not
		all the distributions are equal. Both permutation test and
		asymptotic test are available. These tests are consistent
		against all alternatives where at least two samples have
		different distributions. For more details on KMD and the
		associated tests, see Huang, Z. and B. Sen (2022)
		arXiv:2210.00634.
