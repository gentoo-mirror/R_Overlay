		Fisher's z-Tests Concerning Difference of Correlations //
		Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between
		correlations. diffcor.one() could be used to test for
		differences regarding an expected value, e.g., in construct
		validation. diffcor.two() may be useful in replication studies,
		to test if the original study and the replication study
		differed in terms of effects. diffcor.dep() can be applied to
		check if the correlation between one construct with another one
		(r12) is significantly different/higher/smaller than the
		correlation of one of the constructs with a third construct
		(r13), given the correlation of the constructs that are
		compared (r23). The outputs for all the three functions provide
		the compared correlations, test statistic in z-units, and
		p-values. For diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the output
		further provides confidence intervals of the empirical
		correlations and the effect size Cohens q. According to Cohen
		(1988), q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50| are considered small,
		moderate, and large differences, respectively.
