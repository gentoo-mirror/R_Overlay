		Fisher's z-Tests Concerning Difference of Correlations //
		Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between
		correlations. diffcor.one() can be used to test whether an
		expected value differs from an observed value, for example, in
		construct validation. diffcor.two() can be used to test if the
		correlation between two constructs differed between two
		studies. diffcor.dep() can be applied to check if the
		correlation between two constructs (r12) is significantly
		different from the correlation of the first construct with a
		third one (r13), given the intercorrelation of the compared
		constructs (r23). All outputs provide the compared
		correlations, test statistic in z-units, and p-values. For
		diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the output further provides
		confidence intervals of the empirical correlations and the
		effect size Cohens q. According to Cohen (1988), q = |.10|,
		|.30| and |.50| are considered small, moderate, and large
		differences, respectively.
