		Fisher's z-Tests Concerning Difference of Correlations //
		Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between
		correlations. diffcor.one() could be used to test for
		differences regarding an expected value, e.g., in construct
		validation. diffcor.two() may be useful in replication studies,
		to test if the original study and the replication study
		differed in terms of effects. diffcor.dep() can be applied to
		check if the correlation between one construct with another one
		(r12) is significantly different/higher/smaller than the
		correlation of one of the constructs with a third construct
		(r13), given the correlation of the constructs that are
		compared (r23). The outputs for all the three functions provide
		the test statistic in z-units, p-values, and alpha levels that
		were corrected in terms of multiple testing according to
		Bonferroni. To help interpret the output, the procedure prompts
		if a single p value is smaller than the corrected alpha. For
		diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the effect size Cohens q is
		additionally provided. It is a descriptive index to evaluate
		differences of independent correlations. According to Cohen
		(1988), q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50| are considered small,
		moderate, and large differences, respectively.
