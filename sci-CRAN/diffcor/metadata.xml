		Fisher's z-Tests Concerning Differences Between Correlations //
		Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning different kinds of
		correlation differences. The 'diffpwr' family entails
		approaches to estimating statistical power via Monte Carlo
		simulations. Important to note, the Pearson correlation
		coefficient is sensitive to linear association, but also to a
		host of statistical issues such as univariate and bivariate
		outliers, range restrictions, and heteroscedasticity (e.g.,
		Duncan  Layard, 1973 doi:10.1093/BIOMET/60.3.551; Wilcox, 2013
		doi:10.1016/C2010-0-67044-1). Thus, every power analysis
		requires that specific statistical prerequisites are fulfilled
		and can be invalid if the prerequisites do not hold. To this
		end, the 'bootcor' family provides bootstrapping confidence
		intervals for the incorporated correlation difference tests.
