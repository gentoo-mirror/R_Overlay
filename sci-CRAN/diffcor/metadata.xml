		Fisher's z-Tests Concerning Difference of Correlations //
		Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between
		correlations. diffcor.one() could be used to test for
		differences regarding an expected value, e.g., in construct
		validation. diffcor.two() may be useful in replication studies,
		to test if the original study and the replication study
		differed in terms of effects. diffcor.dep() can be applied to
		check if the correlation between one construct with another one
		(r12) is significantly different/higher/smaller than the
		correlation of one of the constructs with a third construct
		(r13), given the correlation of the constructs that are
		compared (r23). The outputs for all the three functions provide
		the test statistic in z-units, 95 percent confidence intervals,
		and p-values. For diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the output
		further provides the effect size Cohens q as well as confidence
		intervals for the empirical correlations. According to Cohen
		(1988), q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50| are considered small,
		moderate, and large differences, respectively.
