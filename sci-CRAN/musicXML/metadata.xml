		Data Sonification using 'musicXML' // A set of tools to
		facilitate data sonification and handle the 'musicXML' format
		https://usermanuals.musicxml.com/MusicXML/Content/XS-
		MusicXML.htm. Several classes are defined for basic musical
		objects such as note pitch, note duration, note, measure and
		score. Moreover, sonification utilities functions are provided,
		e.g. to map data into musical attributes such as pitch,
		loudness or duration. A typical sonification workflow hence
		looks like: get data; map them to musical attributes; create
		and write the 'musicXML' score, which can then be further
		processed using specialized music software (e.g. 'MuseScore',
		'GuitarPro', etc.). Examples can be found in the blog
		https://globxblog.github.io/, the presentation by Renard and Le
		Bescond (2022, https://hal.science/hal-03710340v1) or the
		poster by Renard et al. (2023,
		https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04388845v1).
