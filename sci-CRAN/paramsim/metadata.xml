		Parameterized Simulation // This function obtains a Random Number
		Generator (RNG) or collection of RNGs that replicate the
		required parameter(s) of a distribution for a time series of
		data. Consider the case of reproducing a time series data set
		of size 20 that uses an autoregressive (AR) model with phi =
		0.8 and standard deviation equal to 1. When one checks the
		arima.sin() function's estimated parameters, it's possible that
		after a single trial or a few more, one won't find the precise
		parameters. This enables one to look for the ideal RNG setting
		for a simulation that will accurately duplicate the desired
		parameters.
