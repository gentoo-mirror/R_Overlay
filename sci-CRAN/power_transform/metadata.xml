		Location and Scale Invariant Power Transformations // Location-
		and scale-invariant Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson power
		transformations allow for transforming variables with
		distributions distant from 0 to normality. Transformers are
		implemented as S4 objects. These allow for transforming new
		instances to normality after optimising fitting parameters on
		other data. A test for central normality allows for rejecting
		transformations that fail to produce a suitably normal
		distribution, independent of sample number.
