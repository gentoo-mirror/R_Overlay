		Profiling Inference Functions for Various Model Classes //
		Provides tools that can be used to calculate, evaluate, plot
		and use for inference the profiles of *arbitrary* inference
		functions for *arbitrary* 'glm'-like fitted models with linear
		predictors. More information on the methods that are
		implemented can be found in Kosmidis (2008)
