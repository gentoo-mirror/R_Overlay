		Calculate ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index // This
		package calculates ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index
		(SII), a standard method for computing the intelligibility of
		speech from acoustical measurements of speech, noise, and
		hearing thresholds. This package includes data frames
		corresponding to Tables 1 - 4 in the ANSI standard as well as a
		function utilizing these tables and user-provided hearing
		threshold and noise level measurements to compute the SII
		score.  The methods implemented here extend the standard
		computations to allow calculation of SII when the measured
		frequencies do not match those required by the standard by
		applying interpolation to obtain values for the required
		frequencies -- Development of this package was funded by the
		Center for Bioscience Education and Technology (CBET) of the
		Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).
