		Loglikelihood Adjustment for Extreme Value Models // Performs
		adjusted inferences based on model objects fitted, using
		maximum likelihood estimation, by the extreme value analysis
		packages 'eva' https://cran.r-project.org/package=eva, 'evd'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=evd, 'evir'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=evir, 'extRemes'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=extRemes, 'fExtremes'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=fExtremes, 'ismev'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=ismev, 'mev'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=mev, 'POT'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=POT and 'texmex'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=texmex. Adjusted standard
		errors and an adjusted loglikelihood are provided, using the
		'chandwich' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=chandwich and the object-
		oriented features of the 'sandwich' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=sandwich. The adjustment is
		based on a robust sandwich estimator of the parameter
		covariance matrix, based on the methodology in Chandler and
		Bate (2007) doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015. This can be used for
		cluster correlated data when interest lies in the parameters of
		the marginal distributions, or for performing inferences that
		are robust to certain types of model misspecification.
		Univariate extreme value models, including regression models,
		are supported.
