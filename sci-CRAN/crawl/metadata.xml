		Fit Continuous-Time Correlated Random Walk Models to Animal
		Movement Data // Fit continuous-time correlated random walk
		models with time indexed covariates to animal telemetry data.
		The model is fit using the Kalman-filter on a state space
		version of the continuous-time stochastic movement process.
