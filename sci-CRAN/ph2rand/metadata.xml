		Randomized Phase II Oncology Trials with Bernoulli Outcomes //
		Provides functions to assist with the design of randomized
		comparative phase II oncology trials that assume their primary
		outcome variable is Bernoulli distributed. Specifically,
		support is provided to (a) perform a sample size calculation
		when using one of several published designs, (b) evaluate the
		operating characteristics of a given design (both analytically
		and via simulation), and (c) produce informative plots.
