		a Non-Parametric Statistical Significance Test for Rolling
		Correlation // Estimates and plots (as a heat map) the
		statistical significance of rolling window correlation
		coefficients, which is carried out through a non-parametric
		computing-intensive method. This method addresses the effects
		due to the multiple testing (inflation of the Type I error)
		when the statistical significance is estimated for the rolling
		window correlation coefficients. The method is based on Monte
		Carlo simulations by permuting one of the variables (dependent)
		under analysis and keeping fixed the other variable
		(independent). We improve the computational efficiency of this
		method to reduce the computation time through parallel
		computing. The 'NonParRolCor' package also provides examples
		with synthetic and real-life ecological time series to
		exemplify its use. Methods derived from R. Telford (2013)

		Martinez (2020) doi:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101163.
