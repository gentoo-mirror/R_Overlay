		a Non-Parametric Statistical Significance Test for Rolling Window
		Correlation // Estimates and plots (as a single plot and as a
		heat map) the rolling window correlation coefficients between
		two time series and computes their statistical significance,
		which is carried out through a non-parametric computing-
		intensive method. This method addresses the effects due to the
		multiple testing (inflation of the Type I error) when the
		statistical significance is estimated for the rolling window
		correlation coefficients. The method is based on Monte Carlo
		simulations by permuting one of the variables (e.g., the
		dependent) under analysis and keeping fixed the other variable
		(e.g., the independent). We improve the computational
		efficiency of this method to reduce the computation time
		through parallel computing. The 'NonParRolCor' package also
		provides examples with synthetic and real-life environmental
		time series to exemplify its use. Methods derived from R.
