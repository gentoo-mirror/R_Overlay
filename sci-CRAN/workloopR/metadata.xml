		Analysis of Work Loops and Other Data from Muscle Physiology
		Experiments // Functions for the import, transformation, and
		analysis of data from muscle physiology experiments. The work
		loop technique is used to evaluate the mechanical work and
		power output of muscle. Josephson (1985)
		doi:10.1242/jeb.114.1.493 modernized the technique for
		application in comparative biomechanics. Although our initial
		motivation was to provide functions to analyze work loop
		experiment data, as we developed the package we incorporated
		the ability to analyze data from experiments that are often
		complementary to work loops. There are currently three
		supported experiment types: work loops, simple twitches, and
		tetanus trials. Data can be imported directly from .ddf files
		or via an object constructor function. Through either method,
		data can then be cleaned or transformed via methods typically
		used in studies of muscle physiology. Data can then be analyzed
		to determine the timing and magnitude of force development and
		relaxation (for isometric trials) or the magnitude of work, net
		power, and instantaneous power among other things (for work
		loops). Although we do not provide plotting functions, all
		resultant objects are designed to be friendly to visualization
		via either base-R plotting or 'tidyverse' functions. This
		package has been peer-reviewed by rOpenSci (v. 1.1.0).
