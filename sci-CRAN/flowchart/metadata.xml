		Tidy Flowchart Generator // Creates participant flow diagrams
		directly from a dataframe. Representing the flow of
		participants through each stage of a study, especially in
		clinical trials, is essential to assess the generalisability
		and validity of the results. This package provides a set of
		functions that can be combined with a pipe operator to create
		all kinds of flowcharts from a data frame in an easy way.
