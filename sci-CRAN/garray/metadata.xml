		Generalized Array Arithmetic for Ragged Arrays with Named Margins
		// Organize a so-called ragged array as generalized arrays,
		which is simply an array with sub-dimensions denoting the
		subdivision of dimensions (grouping of members within
		dimensions). By the margins (names of dimensions and sub-
		dimensions) in generalized arrays, operators and utility
		functions provided in this package automatically match the
		margins, doing map-reduce style calculation along margins.
		Generalized arrays are also cooperative to R's native functions
		that work on simple arrays.
