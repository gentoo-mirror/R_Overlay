		Estimates Allele Frequency on qPCR DeltaDeltaCq from Bulk Samples
		// Interval estimation of the population allele frequency from
		qPCR analysis based on the restriction enzyme digestion
		(RED)-DeltaDeltaCq method (Osakabe et al. 2017,
		doi:10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.04.003), as well as general
		DeltaDeltaCq analysis. Compatible with the Cq measurement of
		DNA extracted from multiple individuals at once, so called
		"group-testing", this model assumes that the quantity of DNA
		extracted from an individual organism follows a gamma
		distribution. Therefore, the point estimate is robust regarding
		the uncertainty of the DNA yield.
