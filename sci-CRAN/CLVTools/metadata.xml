		Tools for Customer Lifetime Value Estimation // Probabilistic
		latent customer attrition models (also known as "buy-'til-you-
		die models") are used to predict future purchase behavior of
		customers. This package includes fast and accurate
		implementations of various probabilistic latent customer
		attrition models for non-contractual settings (e.g., retail
		business) with and without time-invariant and time-varying
		covariates. Currently, the package includes the Pareto/NBD
		model (Pareto/Negative-Binomial-Distribution), the BG/NBD mode
		(Beta-Gamma/Negative-Binomial-Distribution) and the GGom/NBD
		(Gamma-Gompertz/Negative-Binomial-Distribution) for the
		purchase and the attrition processes as well as the Gamma/Gamma
		model for the spending process. For reference to the Pareto/NBD
		model, see Schmittlein DC, Morrison DG, Colombo R (1987)
		doi:10.1287/mnsc.33.1.1, for the BG/NBD model, see Fader PS,
		Hardie BG, Lee K (2005) doi:10.1287/mksc.1040.0098 and for the
		GGom/NBD model see Bemmaor AC, Glady N (2012)
		doi:10.1287/mnsc.1110.1461. For reference to the Gamma/Gamma
		model, see Fader PS, Hardie BG, Lee K (2005)
