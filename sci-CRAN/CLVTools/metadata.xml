		Tools for Customer Lifetime Value Estimation // Probabilistic
		latent customer attrition models (also known as "buy-'til-you-
		die models") are used to predict future purchase behavior of
		customers. This package includes fast and accurate
		implementations of various probabilistic latent customer
		attrition models for non-contractual settings (e.g., retail
		business) with and without time-invariant and time-varying
		covariates. Currently, the package includes the Pareto/NBD
		model (Pareto/Negative-Binomial-Distribution) for the purchase
		and the attrition processes as well as the Gamma/Gamma model
		for the spending process. For reference to the Pareto/NBD
		model, see Schmittlein DC, Morrison DG, Colombo R (1987)
		doi:10.1287/mnsc.33.1.1. For reference to the Gamma/Gamma
		model, see Fader PS, Hardie BG, Lee K (2005)
		doi:10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.415.
