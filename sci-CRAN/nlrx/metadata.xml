		Setup, Run and Analyze 'NetLogo' Model Simulations from 'R' via
		'XML' // The purpose of this package is to provide tools to
		setup, run and analyze 'NetLogo'
		(https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) model simulations in
		'R'. 'nlrx' experiments use a similar structure as 'NetLogos'
		Behavior Space experiments. However, 'nlrx' offers more
		flexibility and additional tools for running and analyzing
		complex simulation designs and sensitivity analyses. The user
		defines all information that is needed in an intuitive
		framework, using class objects. Experiments are submitted from
		'R' to 'NetLogo' via 'XML' files that are dynamically written,
		based on specifications defined by the user. By nesting model
		calls in future environments, large simulation design with many
		runs can be executed in parallel. This also enables simulating
		'NetLogo' experiments on remote HPC machines. In order to use
		this package, 'Java' and 'NetLogo' (= 5.3.1) need to be
		available on the executing system.
