		Visualization of Patient Profiles // Creation of patient profile
		visualizations for exploration, diagnostic or monitoring
		purposes during a clinical trial. These static visualizations
		display a patient-specific overview of the evolution during the
		trial time frame of parameters of interest (as laboratory, ECG,
		vital signs), presence of adverse events, exposure to a
		treatment; associated with metadata patient information, as
		demography, concomitant medication. The visualizations can be
		tailored for specific domain(s) or endpoint(s) of interest.
		Visualizations are exported into patient profile report(s) or
		can be embedded in custom report(s).
