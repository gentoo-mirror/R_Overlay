		Functional Data Analysis for Multiplexed Cell Images // Compare
		variables of interest between (potentially large numbers of)
		spatial interactions and meta-variables. Spatial variables are
		summarized using K, or other, functions, and projected for use
		in a modified random forest model. The model allows comparison
		of functional and non-functional variables to each other and to
		noise, giving statistical significance to the results. Included
		are preparation, modeling, and interpreting tools along with
		example datasets, as described in VanderDoes et al., (2023)
