		Decorate a 'ggplot' with Associated Information // For many
		times, we are not just aligning plots as what 'cowplot' and
		'patchwork' did. Users would like to align associated
		information that requires axes to be exactly matched in
		subplots, e.g. hierarchical clustering with a heatmap. This
		package provides utilities to aligns associated subplots to a
		main plot at different sides (left, right, top and bottom) with
		axes exactly matched.
