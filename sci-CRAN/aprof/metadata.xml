		Amdahl's Profiler, Directed Optimization Made Easy // Assists the
		evaluation of whether and where to focus code optimization,
		using Amdahl's law and visual aids based on line profiling.
		Amdahl's profiler organises profiling output files (planned
		inclusion of memory profiling in the next major release) in a
		visually appealing way. It is meant to help to balance
		development vs. execution time by helping to identify the most
		promising sections of code to optimize and projecting potential
		gains. The package is an addition to R's standard profiling
		tools and is not a wrapper for them.
