		Amdahl's Profiler, Directed Optimization Made Easy // Assists the
		evaluation of whether and where to focus code optimization,
		using Amdahl's law and visual aids based on line profiling.
		Amdahl's profiler organizes profiling output files (including
		memory profiling) in a visually appealing way. It is meant to
		help to balance development vs. execution time by helping to
		identify the most promising sections of code to optimize and
		projecting potential gains. The package is an addition to R's
		standard profiling tools and is not a wrapper for them.
