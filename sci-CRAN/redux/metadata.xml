		R Bindings to 'hiredis' // A 'hiredis' wrapper that includes
		support for transactions, pipelining, blocking subscription,
		serialisation of all keys and values, 'Redis' error handling
		with R errors. Includes an automatically generated 'R6'
		interface to the full 'hiredis' 'API'.  Generated functions are
		faithful to the 'hiredis' documentation while attempting to
		match R's argument semantics.  Serialisation must be explicitly
		done by the user, but both binary and text-mode serialisation
		is supported.
