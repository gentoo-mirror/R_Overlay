		Ecological Inference by Linear Programming under Homogeneity //
		Provides a bunch of algorithms based on linear programming for
		estimating RxC ecological contingency tables (vote transitions
		matrices) using exclusively aggregate results from voting units
		under the homogeneity hypothesis. References: Romero, Pavia,
