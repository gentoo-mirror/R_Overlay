		Two-Stage Difference-in-Differences Following Gardner (2021) //
		Estimates Two-way Fixed Effects difference-in-
		differences/event-study models using the approach proposed by
		Gardner (2021) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2207.05943. To avoid the
		problems caused by OLS estimation of the Two-way Fixed Effects
		model, this function first estimates the fixed effects and
		covariates using untreated observations and then in a second
		stage, estimates the treatment effects.
