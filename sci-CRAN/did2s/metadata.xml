		Two-Stage Difference-in-Differences Following Gardner (2021) //
		Estimates Two-way Fixed Effects difference-in-
		differences/event-study models using the approach proposed by
		Gardner (2021). To avoid the problems caused by OLS estimation
		of the Two-way Fixed Effects model, this function first
		estimates the fixed effects and covariates using untreated
		observations and then in a second stage, estimates the
		treatment effects.
