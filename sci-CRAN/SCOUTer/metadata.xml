		Simulate Controlled Outliers // Using principal component
		analysis as a base model, 'SCOUTer' offers a new approach to
		simulate outliers in a simple and precise way. The user can
		generate new observations defining them by a pair of well-known
		statistics: the Squared Prediction Error (SPE) and the
		Hotelling's T^2 (T^2) statistics. Just by introducing the
		target values of the SPE and T^2, 'SCOUTer' returns a new set
		of observations with the desired target properties. Authors:
		Alba Gonzlez, Abel Folch-Fortuny, Francisco Arteaga and Alberto
		Ferrer (2020).
