		Multivariate Polynomials with Symbolic Parameters in their
		Coefficients // Introduces the 'symbolicQspray' objects. Such
		an object represents a multivariate polynomial whose
		coefficients are fractions of multivariate polynomials with
		rational coefficients. The package allows arithmetic on such
		polynomials. It is based on the 'qspray' and 'ratioOfQsprays'
		packages. Some functions for 'qspray' polynomials have their
		counterpart for 'symbolicQspray' polynomials. A
		'symbolicQspray' polynomial should not be seen as a polynomial
		on the field of fractions of rational polynomials, but should
		rather be seen as a polynomial with rational coefficients
		depending on some parameters, symbolically represented, with a
		dependence given by fractions of rational polynomials.
