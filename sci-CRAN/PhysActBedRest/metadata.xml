		Marks Periods of 'Bedrest' in Actigraph Accelerometer Data //
		Contains a function to categorize accelerometer readings
		collected in free-living (e.g., for 24 hours/day for 7 days),
		preprocessed and compressed as counts (unit-less value) in a
		specified time period termed epoch (e.g., 1 minute) as either
		bedrest (sleep) or active.  The input is a matrix with a
		timestamp column and a column with number of counts per epoch.
		The output is the same dataframe with an additional column
		termed bedrest. In the bedrest column each line (epoch)
		contains a function-generated classification 'br' or 'a'
		denoting bedrest/sleep and activity, respectively.  The package
		is designed to be used after wear/nonwear marking function in
		the 'PhysicalActivity' package.  Version 1.1 adds preschool
		thresholds and corrects for possible errors in algorithm
		implementation.
