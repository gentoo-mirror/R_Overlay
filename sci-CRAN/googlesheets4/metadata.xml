		Access Google Sheets using the Sheets API V4 // Interact with
		Google Sheets through the Sheets API v4
		https://developers.google.com/sheets/api. "API" is an acronym
		for "application programming interface"; the Sheets API allows
		users to interact with Google Sheets programmatically, instead
		of via a web browser. The "v4" refers to the fact that the
		Sheets API is currently at version 4. This package helps the
		user to retrieve Sheet metadata and to read data out of
		specific worksheets or ranges into an R object, such as a data
		frame.
