		Ridge Regression Parameter Estimation // It is a package that
		provides alternative approach for finding optimum parameters of
		ridge regression. This package focuses on finding the ridge
		parameter value k which makes the variance inflation factors
		closest to 1, while keeping them above 1 as addressed by
		Michael Kutner, Christopher Nachtsheim, John Neter, William Li
		(2004, ISBN:978-0073108742). Moreover, the package offers end-
		to-end functionality to find optimum k value and presents the
		detailed ridge regression results. Finally it shows three sets
		of graphs consisting k versus variance inflation factors,
		regression coefficients and standard errors of them.
