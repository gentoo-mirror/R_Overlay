		A Laboratory for TU Games // Cooperative game theory models
		decision-making situations in which a group of agents, called
		players, may achieve certain benefits by cooperating to reach
		an optimal outcome. It has great potential in different fields,
		since it offers a scenario to analyze and solve problems in
		which cooperation is essential to achieve a common goal. The
		'TUGLab' (Transferable Utility Games Laboratory) R package
		contains a set of scripts that could serve as a helpful
		complement to the books and other materials used in courses on
		cooperative game theory, and also as a practical tool for
		researchers working in this field. The 'TUGLab' project was
		born in 2006 trying to highlight the geometrical aspects of the
		theory of cooperative games for 3 and 4 players. 'TUGlabWeb' is
		an online platform on which the basic functions of 'TUGLab' are
		implemented, and it is being used all over the world as a
		resource in degree, master's and doctoral programs. This
		package is an extension of the first versions and enables users
		to work with games in general (computational restrictions
		aside). The user can check properties of games, compute well-
		known games and calculate several set-valued and single-valued
		solutions such as the core, the Shapley value, the nucleolus or
		the core-center. The package also illustrates how the Shapley
		value flexibly adapts to various cooperative game settings,
		including weighted players and coalitions, a priori unions, and
		restricted communication structures. In keeping with the
		original philosophy of the first versions, special emphasis is
		placed on the graphical representation of the solution concepts
		for 3 and 4 players.
