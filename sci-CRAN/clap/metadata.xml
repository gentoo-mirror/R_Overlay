		Detecting Class Overlapping Regions in Multidimensional Data //
		The issue of overlapping regions in multidimensional data
		arises when different classes or clusters share similar feature
		representations, making it challenging to delineate distinct
		boundaries between them accurately. This package provides
		methods for detecting and visualizing these overlapping regions
		using partitional clustering techniques based on nearest
		neighbor distances.
