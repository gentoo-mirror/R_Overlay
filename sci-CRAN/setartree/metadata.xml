		SETAR-Tree - A Novel and Accurate Tree Algorithm for Global Time
		Series Forecasting // The implementation of a forecasting-
		specific tree-based model that is in particular suitable for
		global time series forecasting, as proposed in Godahewa et al.
		(2022) arXiv:2211.08661v1. The model uses the concept of Self
		Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) models to define the
		node splits and thus, the model is named SETAR-Tree. The SETAR-
		Tree uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping
		procedures. It trains global pooled regression models in the
		leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information.
		The depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical
		linearity test as well as measuring the error reduction
		percentage at each node split. Thus, the SETAR-Tree requires
		minimal external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive
		results under its default configuration. A forest is developed
		by extending the SETAR-Tree. The SETAR-Forest combines the
		forecasts provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees
		during the forecasting process.
