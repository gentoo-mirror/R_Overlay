		Differential Expression Enrichment Tool // Abstract of
		Manuscript. Differential gene expression analysis using RNA
		sequencing (RNA-seq) data is a standard approach for making
		biological discoveries. Ongoing large-scale efforts to process
		and normalize publicly available gene expression data enable
		rapid and systematic reanalysis. While several powerful tools
		systematically process RNA-seq data, enabling their reanalysis,
		few resources systematically recompute differentially expressed
		genes (DEGs) generated from individual studies. We developed a
		robust differential expression analysis pipeline to recompute
		3162 human DEG lists from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-
		Tissue Expression Consortium, and 142 studies within the
		Sequence Read Archive. After measuring the accuracy of the
		recomputed DEG lists, we built the Differential Expression
		Enrichment Tool (DEET), which enables users to interact with
		the recomputed DEG lists. DEET, available through CRAN and
		RShiny, systematically queries which of the recomputed DEG
		lists share similar genes, pathways, and TF targets to their
		own gene lists. DEET identifies relevant studies based on
		shared results with the users gene lists, aiding in hypothesis
		generation and data-driven literature review. Sokolowski,
