		Differential Expression Enrichment Tool // RNA sequencing (RNA-
		seq) followed by differential gene expression analyses is a
		fundamental approach for making biological discoveries. Ongoing
		large-scale efforts to systematically process and normalize
		publicly available gene expression data facilitate rapid
		reanalyses of specific studies and the development of new
		methods for querying it. While there are several powerful tools
		for querying systematically processed publicly available RNA-
		seq data at the individual sample level, there are fewer
		options for querying differentially expressed gene (DEG) lists
		generated from these experiments. Here, we present the
		Differential Expression Enrichment Tool (DEET), which allows
		users to interact with 3162 consistently processed DEG lists
		curated from 142 RNA-seq datasets obtained from recount2
		database, which contains data from consortiums (GTex, TCGA) and
		individual labs (SRA). To establish DEET we integrated
		systematically processed human RNA-seq data from recount2 with
		reported and predicted metadata from multiple sources and
		developed a CRAN R package and Shiny App where users can
		compare their genes, p-values, and coefficients against the DEG
		lists within DEET. Here we present DEET and demonstrate how it
		can facilitate hypothesis generation and provide biological
		insight from user-defined differential gene expression results.
