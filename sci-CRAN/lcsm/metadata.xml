		Univariate and Bivariate Latent Change Score Modelling // Helper
		functions to implement univariate and bivariate latent change
		score models in R using the 'lavaan' package. For details about
		Latent Change Score Modeling (LCSM) see McArdle (2009)
		doi:10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163612 and Grimm, An,
		McArdle, Zonderman and Resnick (2012)
		doi:10.1080/10705511.2012.659627. The package automatically
		generates 'lavaan' syntax for different model specifications
		and varying timepoints. The 'lavaan' syntax generated by this
		package can be returned and further specifications can be added
		manually. Longitudinal plots as well as simplified path
		diagrams can be created to visualise data and model
		specifications. Estimated model parameters and fit statistics
		can be extracted as data frames. Data for different univariate
		and bivariate LCSM can be simulated by specifying estimates for
		model parameters to explore their effects. This package
		combines the strengths of other R packages like 'lavaan',
		'broom', and 'semPlot' by generating 'lavaan' syntax that helps
		these packages work together.
