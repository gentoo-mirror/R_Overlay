		Batch Process Files // Processes multiple files with a user-
		supplied function. The key design principle is that only files
		which were last modified before the directory was configured
		are processed. A hidden file stores the configuration time and
		function etc while successfully processed files are
		automatically touched to update their modification date. As a
		result batch processing can be stopped and restarted and any
		files created (or modified or deleted) during processing are
		ignored.
