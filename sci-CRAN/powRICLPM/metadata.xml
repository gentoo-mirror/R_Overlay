		Perform Power Analysis for the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged
		Panel Model // Perform user-friendly power analyses for the
		bivariate random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM).
		The strategy as proposed by Mulder (2022)
		doi:10.1080/10705511.2022.2122467 is implemented. Extended
		power analysis options include the use of bounded estimation,
		inclusion of measurement error in the data generating model and
		estimation model (i.e., the stable trait autoregressive trait
		state, STARTS, model), imposing various constraints over time
		on the parameters of the estimation model, among others.
