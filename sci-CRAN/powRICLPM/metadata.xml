		Perform Power Analysis for the RI-CLPM and STARTS Model //
		Perform user-friendly power analyses for the random intercept
		cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) and the bivariate stable
		trait autoregressive trait state (STARTS) model. The strategy
		as proposed by Mulder (2023) doi:10.1080/10705511.2022.2122467
		is implemented. Extensions include the use of parameter
		constraints over time, bounded estimation, generation of data
		with skewness and kurtosis, and the option to setup the power
		analysis for Mplus.
