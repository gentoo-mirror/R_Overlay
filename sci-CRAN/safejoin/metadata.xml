		Perform "Safe" Table Joins // The goal of 'safejoin' is to
		guarantee that when performing joins extra rows are not added
		to your data. 'safejoin' provides a wrapper around
		'dplyr::left_join' that will raise an error when extra rows are
		unexpectedly added to your data. This can be useful when
		working with data where you expect there to be a many to one
		relationship but you are not certain the relationship holds.
