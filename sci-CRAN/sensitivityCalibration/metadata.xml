		A Calibrated Sensitivity Analysis for Matched Observational
		Studies // Implements the calibrated sensitivity analysis
		approach for matched observational studies. Our sensitivity
		analysis framework views matched sets as drawn from a super-
		population. The unmeasured confounder is modeled as a random
		variable. We combine matching and model-based covariate-
		adjustment methods to estimate the treatment effect. The
		hypothesized unmeasured confounder enters the picture as a
		missing covariate. We adopt a state-of-art Expectation
		Maximization (EM) algorithm to handle this missing covariate
		problem in generalized linear models (GLMs). As our method also
		estimates the effect of each observed covariate on the outcome
		and treatment assignment, we are able to calibrate the
		unmeasured confounder to observed covariates. Zhang, B., Small,
