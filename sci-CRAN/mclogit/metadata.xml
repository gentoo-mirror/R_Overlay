		Mixed Conditional Logit Models // Specification and estimation of
		conditional logit models of binary responses and multinomial
		counts is provided, with or without alternative- specific
		random effects. The current implementation of the estimator for
		random effects variances uses a Laplace approximation (or PQL)
		approach and thus should be used only if groups sizes are
		large.
