		Multinomial Logit Models, with or without Random Effects or
		Overdispersion // Provides estimators for multinomial logit
		models in their conditional logit and baseline logit variants,
		with or without random effects, with or without overdispersion.
		Random effects models are estimated using the PQL technique
		(based on a Laplace approximation) or the MQL technique (based
		on a Solomon-Cox approximation). Estimates should be treated
		with caution if the group sizes are small.
