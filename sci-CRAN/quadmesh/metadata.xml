		Quadrangle Mesh // Create surface forms from matrix or 'raster'
		data for flexible plotting and conversion to other mesh types.
		The functions 'quadmesh' or 'triangmesh' produce a continuous
		surface as a 'mesh3d' object as used by the 'rgl' package. This
		is used for plotting raster data in 3D (optionally with
		texture), and allows the application of a map projection
		without data loss and many processing applications that are
		restricted by inflexible regular grid rasters. There are
		discrete forms of these continuous surfaces available with
		'dquadmesh' and 'dtriangmesh' functions.
