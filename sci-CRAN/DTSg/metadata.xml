		A Class for Working with Time Series Based on 'data.table' and
		'R6' with Largely Optional Reference Semantics // Basic time
		series functionalities such as listing of missing values,
		application of arbitrary aggregation as well as rolling
		(asymmetric) window functions and automatic detection of
		periodicity. As it is mainly based on 'data.table', it is fast
		and - in combination with the 'R6' package - offers reference
		semantics. In addition to its native R6 interface, it provides
		an S3 interface inclusive an S3 wrapper method generator for
		those who prefer the latter. Finally yet importantly, its
		functional approach allows incorporating functionalities from
		many other packages.
