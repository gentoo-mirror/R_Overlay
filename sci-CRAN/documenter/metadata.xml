		Documents Files // It is sometimes necessary to create
		documentation for all files in a directory. Doing so by hand
		can be very tedious. This task is made fast and reproducible
		using the functionality of 'documenter'. It aggregates all text
		files in a directory and its subdirectories into a single word
		document in a semi-automated fashion.
