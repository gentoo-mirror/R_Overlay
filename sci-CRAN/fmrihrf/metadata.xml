		Hemodynamic Response Functions for fMRI Data Analysis // Creates,
		manipulates, and evaluates hemodynamic response functions and
		event-related regressors for functional magnetic resonance
		imaging data analysis. Supports multiple basis sets including
		Canonical, Gamma, Gaussian, B-spline, and Fourier bases.
		Features decorators for time-shifting and blocking, and
		efficient convolution algorithms for regressor construction.
		Methods are based on standard fMRI analysis techniques as
		described in Jezzard et al. (2001, ISBN:9780192630711).
