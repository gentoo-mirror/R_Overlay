		Neural Network Weights Transformation into Polynomial
		Coefficients // Implements a method that builds the
		coefficients of a polynomial model that performs almost
		equivalently as a given neural network (densely connected).
		This is achieved using Taylor expansion at the activation
		functions.  The obtained polynomial coefficients can be used to
		explain features (and their interactions) importance  in the
		neural network, therefore working as a tool for
		interpretability or eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
