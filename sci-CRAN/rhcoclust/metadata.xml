		Robust Hierarchical Co-Clustering to Identify Significant Co-
		Cluster // Here we performs robust hierarchical co-clustering
		between row and column entities of a data matrix in absence and
		presence of outlying observations. It can be used to explore
		important co-clusters consisting of important samples and their
		regulatory significant features. Please see Hasan, Badsha and
		Mollah (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.05.13.094946.
