		Isoscape Computation and Inference of Spatial Origins using Mixed
		Models // Building isoscapes using mixed models and inferring
		the geographic origin of samples based on their isotopic
		ratios. This package is essentially a simplified interface to
		several other packages which implements a new statistical
		framework based on mixed models. It uses 'spaMM' for fitting
		and predicting isoscapes, and assigning an organism's origin
		depending on its isotopic ratio. 'IsoriX' also relies heavily
		on the package 'rasterVis' for plotting the maps produced with
		'terra' using 'lattice'.
