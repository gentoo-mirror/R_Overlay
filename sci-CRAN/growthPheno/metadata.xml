		Functional Analysis of Phenotypic Growth Data to Smooth and
		Extract Traits // Assists in the plotting and functional
		smoothing of traits measured over time and the extraction of
		features from these traits, implementing the SET (Smoothing and
		Extraction of Traits) method described in Brien et al. (2020)
		Plant Methods, 16. Smoothing of growth trends for individual
		plants using natural cubic smoothing splines or P-splines is
		available for removing transient effects and segmented
		smoothing is available to deal with discontinuities in growth
		trends. There are graphical tools for assessing the adequacy of
		trait smoothing, both when using this and other packages, such
		as those that fit nonlinear growth models. A range of per-unit
		(plant, pot, plot) growth traits or features can be extracted
		from the data, including single time points, interval growth
		rates and other growth statistics, such as maximum growth or
		days to maximum growth. The package also has tools adapted to
		inputting data from high-throughput phenotyping facilities,
		such from a Lemna-Tec Scananalyzer 3D (see
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRAF_mAEa7E/ for more
		information). The package 'growthPheno' can also be installed
		from http://chris.brien.name/rpackages/.
