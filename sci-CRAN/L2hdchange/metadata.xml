		L2 Inference for Change Points in High-Dimensional Time Series //
		Provides a method for detecting multiple change points in high-
		dimensional time series, targeting dense or spatially clustered
		signals. See Li et al. (2023) "L2 Inference for Change Points
		in High-Dimensional Time Series via a Two-Way MOSUM". arXiv
		preprint arXiv:2208.13074.
