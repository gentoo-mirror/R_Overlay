		Simulation of Cohort Platform Trials for Combination Treatments
		// A collection of functions dedicated to simulating staggered
		entry platform trials whereby the treatment under investigation
		is a combination of two active compounds. In order to obtain
		approval for this combination therapy, superiority of the
		combination over the two active compounds and superiority of
		the two active compounds over placebo need to be demonstrated.
		A more detailed description of the design can be found in Meyer
		et al. DOI:10.1002/pst.2194 and a manual in Meyer et al.
		arXiv:2202.02182.
