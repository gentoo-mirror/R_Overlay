		Methods for Closed Testing with Simes Inequality, in Particular
		Hommel's Method // Provides methods for closed testing using
		Simes local tests. In particular, calculates adjusted p-values
		for Hommel's multiple testing method, and provides lower
		confidence bounds for true discovery proportions. A robust but
		more conservative variant of the closed testing procedure that
		does not require the assumption of Simes inequality is also
		implemented. The methods have been described in detail in
		Goeman et al (2016) arXiv:1611.06739v2.
