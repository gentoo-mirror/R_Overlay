		Methods for Closed Testing with Simes Inequality, in Particular
		Hommel's Method // Provides methods for closed testing using
		Simes local tests. In particular, calculates adjusted p-values
		for Hommel's multiple testing method, and provides lower
		confidence bounds for true discovery proportions. A robust but
		more conservative variant of the closed testing procedure that
		does not require the assumption of Simes inequality is also
		implemented.
