		Visualization of the Local and Global Survival Model Explanations
		// Survival models may have very different structures. This
		package contains functions for creating a unified
		representation of a 'survival' models, which can be further
		processed by various survival explainers. Tools implemented in
		'survxai' help to understand how input variables are used in
		the model and what impact do they have on the final model
		prediction. Currently, four explanation methods are
		implemented. We can divide them into two groups: local and
		global. Explanations of the methods can be found in Grudziaz et
		al.(2018) doi:10.21105/joss.00961.
