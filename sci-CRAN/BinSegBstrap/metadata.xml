		Piecewise Smooth Regression by Bootstrapped Binary Segmentation
		// Provides methods for piecewise smooth regression. A
		piecewise smooth signal is estimated by applying a bootstrapped
		test recursively (binary segmentation approach). Each
		bootstrapped test decides whether the underlying signal is
		smooth on the currently considered subsegment or contains at
		least one further change-point.
