		Reference Limits using QQ Methodology // A collection of routines
		for finding reference limits using, where appropriate, QQ
		methodology.  All use a data vector X of cases from the
		reference population. The default is to get the central 95%
		reference range of the population, namely the 2.5 and 97.5
		percentile, with optional adjustment of the range.  Along with
		the reference limits, we want confidence intervals which, for
		historical reasons, are typically at 90% confidence.  A full
		analysis provides six numbers:  the upper and the lower
		reference limits, and - each of their confidence intervals. For
		application details, see Hawkins and Esquivel (2024)
