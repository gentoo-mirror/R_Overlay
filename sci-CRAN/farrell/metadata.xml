		Interactive Interface to Data Envelopment Analysis Modeling //
		Allows the user to execute interactively radial data
		envelopment analysis models. The user has the ability to upload
		a data frame, select the input/output variables, choose the
		technology assumption to adopt and decide whether to run an
		input or an output oriented model. When the model is executed a
		set of results are displayed which include efficiency scores,
		peers' determination, scale efficiencies' evaluation and
		slacks' calculation. Fore more information about the
		theoretical background of the package, please refer to Bogetoft
