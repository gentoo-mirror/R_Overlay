		Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models // An
		implementation of about 6 major classes of statistical
		regression models. The central algorithm is Fisher scoring and
		iterative reweighted least squares. At the heart of this
		package are the vector generalized linear and additive model
		(VGLM/VGAM) classes. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as
		multivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs that use
		smoothing. The book "Vector Generalized Linear and Additive
		Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015)
		DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7 gives details of the statistical
		framework and the package. Currently only fixed-effects models
		are implemented. Many (150+) models and distributions are
		estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized
		MLE. The other classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs),
		quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column
		interaction models)---these classes perform constrained and
		unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology,
		as well as constrained additive ordination (CAO). Hauck-Donner
		effect detection is implemented. Note that these functions are
		subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog files for latest
		changes.
