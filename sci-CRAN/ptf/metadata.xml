		Probit Tensor Factorization // Efficient algorithms to implement
		Probit Tensor Factorization (PTF) model for statistical
		relational learning, which not only inherits the computation
		efficiency from the classic tensor factorization model but also
		accounts for the binary nature of relational data. The
		methodology is based on Ye Liu (2021) https://repository.lib.nc
		su.edu/bitstream/handle/1840.20/37507/etd.pdf?sequence=1
		"Computational Methods for Complex Models with Latent
		Structure".
