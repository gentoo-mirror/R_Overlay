		Hierarchical Sufficient Dimension Reduction // Provides
		semiparametric sufficient dimension reduction for central mean
		subspaces for heterogeneous data defined by combinations of
		binary factors (such as chronic conditions). Subspaces are
		estimated to be hierarchically nested to respect the structure
		of subpopulations with overlapping characteristics. This
		package is an implementation of the proposed methodology of
		Huling and Yu (2021) doi:10.1111/biom.13546.
