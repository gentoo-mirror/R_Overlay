		Feasible Solution Algorithm for Finding Best Subsets and
		Interactions // Assists in statistical model building to find
		optimal and semi-optimal higher order interactions and best
		subsets. Uses the lm(), glm(), and other R functions to fit
		models generated from a feasible solution algorithm. Discussed
		in Subset Selection in Regression, A Miller (2002). Applied and
		explained for least median of squares in Hawkins (1993)
		doi:10.1016/0167-9473(93)90246-P. The feasible solution
		algorithm comes up with model forms of a specific type that can
		have fixed variables, higher order interactions and their lower
		order terms.
