		High-Resolution Melting (HRM) Curve Analysis // The analysis of
		high-resolution melting (HRM) curves provides cost-efficient
		post-PCR distinction among amplicons differing by as little as
		a single base pair, based on their thermal denaturation
		(melting) properties. HRM curve analysis has been used mainly
		for genotyping and detection of mutations. Beside genotyping,
		the method has been used to differentiate viral, bacterial and
		fungal pathogens, and it has a potential for plant genotyping
		in breeding and as an alternative to DNA barcoding for
		taxonomic assignment of species. This package offers functions
		that facilitate drawing denaturation, melting, and difference
		curves in HRM curve analysis in R. Lukas Beule was supported by
		the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in
		the framework of the Bonares-SIGNAL project (funding codes:
		031A562A and 031B0510A). Please cite Schiwek et al. (2020)
		doi:10.3390/pathogens9040270 if you use this package in your
		work.
