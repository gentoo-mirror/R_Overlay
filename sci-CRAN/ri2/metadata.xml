		Randomization Inference for Randomized Experiments //
		Randomization inference procedures for simple and complex
		randomized designs, including multi-armed trials, as described
		in Gerber and Green (2012, ISBN: 978-0393979954). Users
		formally describe their randomization procedure and test
		statistic. The randomization distribution of the test statistic
		under some null hypothesis is efficiently simulated.
