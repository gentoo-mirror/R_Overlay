		A Calculator for Single-Case Effect Sizes // Provides R functions
		for calculating basic effect size indices for single-case
		designs, including several non-overlap measures and parametric
		effect size measures, and for estimating the gradual effects
		model developed by Swan and Pustejovsky (2018)
		DOI:10.1080/00273171.2018.1466681. Standard errors and
		confidence intervals (based on the assumption that the outcome
		measurements are mutually independent) are provided for the
		subset of effect sizes indices with known sampling
		distributions.
