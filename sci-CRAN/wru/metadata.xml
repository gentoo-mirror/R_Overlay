		Who are You? Bayesian Prediction of Racial Category Using
		Surname, First Name, Middle Name, and Geolocation // Predicts
		individual race/ethnicity using surname, first name, middle
		name, geolocation, and other attributes, such as gender and
		age. The method utilizes Bayes' Rule (with optional measurement
		error correction) to compute the posterior probability of each
		racial category for any given individual. The package
		implements methods described in Imai and Khanna (2016)
		"Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual
		Ethnicity from Voter Registration Records" Political Analysis
		DOI:10.1093/pan/mpw001 and Imai, Olivella, and Rosenman (2022)
		"Addressing census data problems in race imputation via fully
		Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding and name supplements"
		DOI:10.1126/sciadv.adc9824.  The package also incorporates the
		data described in Rosenman, Olivella, and Imai (2023) "Race and
		ethnicity data for first, middle, and surnames"
		DOI:10.1038/s41597-023-02202-2.
