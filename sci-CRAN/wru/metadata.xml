		Who are You? Bayesian Prediction of Racial Category Using Surname
		and Geolocation // Predicts individual race/ethnicity using
		surname, geolocation, and other attributes, such as gender and
		age. The method utilizes the Bayes' Rule to compute the
		posterior probability of each racial category for any given
		individual. The package implements methods described in Imai
		and Khanna (2015) "Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting
		Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration Records"
