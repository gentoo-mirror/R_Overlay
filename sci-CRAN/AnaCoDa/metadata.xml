		Analysis of Codon Data under Stationarity using a Bayesian
		Framework // Is a collection of models to analyze genome scale
		codon data using a Bayesian framework. Provides visualization
		routines and checkpointing for model fittings. Currently
		published models to analyze gene data for selection on codon
		usage based on Ribosome Overhead Cost (ROC) are: ROC (Gilchrist
		et al. (2015) doi:10.1093/gbe/evv087), and ROC with phi
		(Wallace  Drummond (2013) doi:10.1093/molbev/mst051). In
		addition 'AnaCoDa' contains three currently unpublished models.
		The FONSE (First order approximation On NonSense Error) model
		analyzes gene data for selection on codon usage against of
		nonsense error rates. The PA (PAusing time) and PANSE (PAusing
		time + NonSense Error) models use ribosome footprinting data to
		analyze estimate ribosome pausing times with and without
		nonsense error rate from ribosome footprinting data.
