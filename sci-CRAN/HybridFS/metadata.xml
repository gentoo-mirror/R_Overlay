		A Hybrid Filter-Wrapper Feature Selection Method // A hybrid
		method of feature selection which combines both filter and
		wrapper methods. The first level involves feature reduction
		based on some of the important filter methods while the second
		level involves feature subset selection as in a wrapper method.
		Comparative analysis with the existing feature selection
		packages shows this package results in higher classification
		accuracy, reduced processing time and improved data handling
		capacity.
