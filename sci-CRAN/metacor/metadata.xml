		Meta-Analytic Effect Size Calculation for Pre-Post Designs with
		Correlation Imputation // Tools for the calculation of effect
		sizes (standardised mean difference) and mean difference in
		pre-post controlled studies, including robust imputation of
		missing variances (standard deviation of changes) and
		correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient). The main
		function 'metacor_dual()' implements several methods for
		imputing missing standard deviation of changes or Pearson
		correlation coefficient, and generates transparent imputation
		reports. Designed for meta-analyses with incomplete summary
		statistics. For details on the methods, see Higgins et al.
		(2023) and Fu et al. (2013).
