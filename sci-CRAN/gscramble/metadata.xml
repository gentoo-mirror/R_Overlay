		Simulating Admixed Genotypes Without Replacement // A genomic
		simulation approach for creating biologically informed
		individual genotypes from empirical data that 1) samples
		alleles from populations without replacement, 2) segregates
		alleles based on species-specific recombination rates.
		'gscramble' is a flexible simulation approach that allows users
		to create pedigrees of varying complexity in order to simulate
		admixed genotypes. Furthermore, it allows users to track
		haplotype blocks from the source populations through the
		pedigrees.
