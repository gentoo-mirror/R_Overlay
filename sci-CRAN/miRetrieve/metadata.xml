		miRNA Text Mining in Abstracts // Providing tools for microRNA
		(miRNA) text mining. miRetrieve summarizes miRNA literature by
		extracting, counting, and analyzing miRNA names, thus aiming at
		gaining biological insights into a large amount of text within
		a short period of time. To do so, miRetrieve uses regular
		expressions to extract miRNAs and tokenization to identify
		meaningful miRNA associations. In addition, miRetrieve uses the
		latest miRTarBase version 8.0 (Hsi-Yuan Huang et al. (2020)
		"miRTarBase 2020: updates to the experimentally validated
		microRNAtarget interaction database" doi:10.1093/nar/gkz896) to
		display field-specific miRNA-mRNA interactions. The most
		important functions are available as a Shiny web application
		under https://miretrieve.shinyapps.io/miRetrieve/.
