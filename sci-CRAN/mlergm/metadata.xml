		Multilevel Exponential-Family Random Graph Models // Estimates
		exponential-family random graph models for multilevel network
		data, assuming the multilevel structure is observed. The scope,
		at present, covers multilevel models where the set of nodes is
		nested within known blocks. The estimation method uses Monte-
		Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (MCMLE) methods to estimate
		a variety of canonical or curved exponential family models for
		binary random graphs. MCMLE methods for curved exponential-
		family random graph models can be found in Hunter and Handcock
		(2006) DOI: 10.1198/106186006X133069. The package supports
		parallel computing, and provides methods for assessing
		goodness-of-fit of models and visualization of networks.
