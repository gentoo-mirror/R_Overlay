		Quantitative Pest Risk Assessment at the Entry Step // Supports
		risk assessors in performing the entry step of the quantitative
		Pest Risk Assessment. It allows the estimation of the amount of
		a plant pest entering a risk assessment area (in terms of
		founder populations) through the calculation of the imported
		commodities that could be potential pathways of pest entry, and
		the development of a pathway model. Two 'Shiny' apps based on
		the functionalities of the package are included, that simplify
		the process of assessing the risk of entry of plant pests. The
		approach is based on the work of the European Food Safety
		Authority (EFSA PLH Panel et al., 2018)
