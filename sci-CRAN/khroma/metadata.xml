		Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization // Color schemes
		ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or
		sequential), with colors that are distinct for all people,
		including color-blind readers. This package provides an
		implementation of Paul Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018)
		doi:10.5194/gmd-11-2541-2018 color schemes for use with
		'graphics' or 'ggplot2'. It provides tools to simulate color-
		blindness and to test how well the colors of any palette are
		identifiable. Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic
		timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented.
