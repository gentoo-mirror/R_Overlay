		Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization // Colour
		schemes ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or
		sequential), with colours that are distinct for all people,
		including colour-blind readers. This package provides an
		implementation of Paul Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018) doi:
		10.5194/gmd-11-2541-2018 colour schemes for use with 'graphics'
		or 'ggplot2'. It provides tools to simulate colour-blindness
		and to test how well the colours of any palette are
		identifiable. Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic
		timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented.
