		Sparse High-Dimensional Linear Regression with PROBE //
		Implements an efficient and powerful Bayesian approach for
		sparse high-dimensional linear regression. It uses minimal
		prior assumptions on the parameters through plug-in empirical
		Bayes estimates of hyperparameters. An efficient Parameter-
		Expanded Expectation-Conditional-Maximization (PX-ECM)
		algorithm estimates maximum a posteriori (MAP) values of
		regression parameters and variable selection probabilities. The
		PX-ECM results in a robust computationally efficient
		coordinate-wise optimization, which adjusts for the impact of
		other predictor variables. The E-step is motivated by the
		popular two-group approach to multiple testing. The result is a
		PaRtitiOned empirical Bayes Ecm (PROBE) algorithm applied to
		sparse high-dimensional linear regression, implemented using
		one-at-a-time or all-at-once type optimization. More
		information can be found in McLain, Zgodic, and Bondell (2022)
		arXiv:2209.08139.
