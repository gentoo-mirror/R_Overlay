		Fast and Scalable Single Cell Differential Expression Analysis
		using Mixed-Effects Models // A fast and scalable linear mixed-
		effects model (LMM) estimation algorithm for analysis of
		single-cell differential expression. The algorithm uses
		summary-level statistics and requires less computer memory to
		fit the LMM.
