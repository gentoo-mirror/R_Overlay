		Extra Functionality for the 'xpose' Package // Adding some at-
		present missing functionality, or functions unlikely to be
		added to the base 'xpose' package.  This includes some
		diagnostic plots that have been missing in translation from
		'xpose4', but also some useful features that truly extend the
		capabilities of what can be done with 'xpose'. These extensions
		include the concept of a set of 'xpose' objects, and
		diagnostics for likelihood-based models.
