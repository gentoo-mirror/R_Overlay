		DNA Sequence Motifs // Motifs within biological sequences show a
		significant role. This package utilizes a user-defined
		threshold value (window size and similarity) to create
		consensus segments or motifs through local alignment of dynamic
		programming with gap and it calculates the frequency of each
		identified motif, offering a detailed view of their prevalence
		within the dataset. It allows for thorough exploration and
		understanding of sequence patterns and their biological
		importance.
