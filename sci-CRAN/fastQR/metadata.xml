		Fast QR Decomposition and Update // Efficient algorithms for
		performing, updating, and downdating the QR decomposition, R
		decomposition, or the inverse of the R decomposition of a
		matrix as rows or columns are added or removed. It also
		includes functions for solving linear systems of equations,
		normal equations for linear regression models, and normal
		equations for linear regression with a RIDGE penalty. For a
		detailed introduction to these methods, see the book by Golub
		and Van Loan (2013, doi:10.1007/978-3-319-05089-8) for complete
		introduction to the methods.
