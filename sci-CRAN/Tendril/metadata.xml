		Compute and Display Tendril Plots // Compute the coordinates to
		produce a tendril plot. In the tendril plot, each tendril
		(branch) represents a type of events, and the direction of the
		tendril is dictated by on which treatment arm the event is
		occurring. If an event is occurring on the first of the two
		specified treatment arms, the tendril bends in a clockwise
		direction. If an event is occurring on the second of the
		treatment arms, the tendril bends in an anti-clockwise
		direction. Ref: Karpefors, M and Weatherall, J., "The Tendril
		Plot - a novel visual summary of the incidence, significance
		and temporal aspects of adverse events in clinical trials" -
