		Urban Water and Sanitation Survey Dataset // Urban water and
		sanitation survey dataset collected by Water and Sanitation for
		the Urban Poor (WSUP) with technical support from Valid
		International. These citywide surveys have been collecting data
		allowing water and sanitation service levels across the entire
		city to be characterised, while also allowing more detailed
		data to be collected in areas of the city of particular
		interest. These surveys are intended to generate useful
		information for others working in the water and sanitation
		sector. Current release version includes datasets collected
		from a survey conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh in March 2017.
		This survey in Dhaka is one of a series of surveys to be
		conducted by WSUP in various cities in which they operate
		including Accra, Ghana; Nakuru, Kenya; Antananarivo,
		Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and, Lusaka, Zambia. This
		package will be updated once the surveys in other cities are
		completed and datasets have been made available.
