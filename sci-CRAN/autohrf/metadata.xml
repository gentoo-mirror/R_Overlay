		Automated Generation of Data-Informed GLM Models in Task-Based
		fMRI Data Analysis // Analysis of task-related functional
		magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity at the level of
		individual participants is commonly based on general linear
		modelling (GLM) that allows us to estimate to what extent the
		blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal can be
		explained by task response predictors specified in the GLM
		model. The predictors are constructed by convolving the
		hypothesised timecourse of neural activity with an assumed
		hemodynamic response function (HRF). To get valid and precise
		estimates of task response, it is important to construct a
		model of neural activity that best matches actual neuronal
		activity. The construction of models is most often driven by
		predefined assumptions on the components of brain activity and
		their duration based on the task design and specific aims of
		the study. However, our assumptions about the onset and
		duration of component processes might be wrong and can also
		differ across brain regions. This can result in inappropriate
		or suboptimal models, bad fitting of the model to the actual
		data and invalid estimations of brain activity. Here we present
		an approach in which theoretically driven models of task
		response are used to define constraints based on which the
		final model is derived computationally using the actual data.
		Specifically, we developed 'autohrf'  a package for the 'R'
		programming language that allows for data-driven estimation of
		HRF models. The package uses genetic algorithms to efficiently
		search for models that fit the underlying data well. The
		package uses automated parameter search to find the onset and
		duration of task predictors which result in the highest fitness
		of the resulting GLM based on the fMRI signal under predefined
		restrictions. We evaluate the usefulness of the 'autohrf'
		package on publicly available datasets of task-related fMRI
		activity. Our results suggest that by using 'autohrf' users can
		find better task related brain activity models in a quick and
		efficient manner.
