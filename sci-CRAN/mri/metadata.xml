		Modified Rand and Wallace Indices // It provides functions to
		compute the values of different modifications of the Rand and
		Wallace indices. The indices are used to measure the stability
		or similarity of two partitions obtained on two different sets
		of units with a non-empty intercept. Splitting and merging of
		clusters can (depends on the selected index) have a different
		effect on the value of the indices.  The indices are proposed
		in Cugmas and Ferligoj (2018) http://ibmi.mf.uni-
		lj.si/mz/2018/no-1/Cugmas2018.pdf.
