		Bootstrap Stacking of Random Forest Models for Heterogeneous Data
		// Generates and predicts a set of linearly stacked Random
		Forest models using bootstrap sampling. Individual datasets may
		be heterogeneous (not all samples have full sets of features).
		Contains support for parallelization but the user should
		register their cores before running. This is an extension of
		the method found in Matlock (2018)
