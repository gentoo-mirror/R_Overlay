		Piece-Wise Exponential Additive Mixed Modeling Tools // The
		Piece-wise exponential (Additive Mixed) Model (PAMM; Bender and
		Scheipl (2018) doi: 10.1177/1471082X17748083) is a powerful
		model class for survival analysis, based on Generalized
		Additive (Mixed) Models (GA(M)Ms). It offers intuitive
		specification and robust estimation of complex survival models
		with stratified baseline hazards, random effects, time-varying
		effects, time-dependent covariates and cumulative effects
		(Bender et. al. (2018) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy003.
		pammtools provides tidy workflow for survival analysis with
		PAMMs, including data transformation and other pre- and post-
		processing functions as well as visualization.
