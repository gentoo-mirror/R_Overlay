		Piece-Wise Exponential Additive Mixed Modeling Tools for Survival
		Analysis // The Piece-wise exponential (Additive Mixed) Model
		(PAMM; Bender and Scheipl (2018) doi: 10.1177/1471082X17748083)
		is a powerful model class for the analysis of survival (or
		time-to-event) data, based on Generalized Additive (Mixed)
		Models (GA(M)Ms). It offers intuitive specification and robust
		estimation of complex survival models with stratified baseline
		hazards, random effects, time-varying effects, time-dependent
		covariates and cumulative effects (Bender and others (2018)
		doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxy003, as well as support for left-
		truncated, competing risks and recurrent events data. pammtools
		provides tidy workflow for survival analysis with PAMMs,
		including data simulation, transformation and other functions
		for data preprocessing and model post-processing as well as
		visualization.
