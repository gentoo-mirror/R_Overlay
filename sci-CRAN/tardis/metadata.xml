		Text Analysis with Rules and Dictionaries for Inferring Sentiment
		// Measure text's sentiment with dictionaries and simple rules
		covering negations and modifiers. User-supplied dictionaries
		are supported, including Unicode emojis and multi-word tokens,
		so this package can also be used to study constructs beyond
		sentiment.
