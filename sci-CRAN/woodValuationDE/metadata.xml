		Wood Valuation Germany // Monetary valuation of wood in German
		forests (stumpage values), including estimations of harvest
		quantities, wood revenues, and harvest costs. The functions are
		sensitive to tree species, mean diameter of the harvested
		trees, stand quality, and logging method. The functions include
		estimations for the consequences of disturbances on revenues
		and costs. The underlying assortment tables are taken from
		Offer and Staupendahl (2018) with corresponding functions for
		salable and skidded volume derived in Fuchs et al. (2023). Wood
		revenue and harvest cost functions were taken from v.
		Bodelschwingh (2018). The consequences of disturbances refer to
		Dieter (2001), Moellmann and Moehring (2017), and Fuchs et al.
		(2022a, 2022b). For the full references see documentation of
		the functions, package README, and Fuchs et al. (2023). Apart
		from Dieter (2001) and Moellmann and Moehring (2017), all
		functions and factors are based on data from HessenForst, the
		forest administration of the Federal State of Hesse in Germany.
