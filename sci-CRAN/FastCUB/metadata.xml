		Fast Estimation of CUB Models via Louis' Identity // For ordinal
		rating data, consider the accelerated EM algorithm to estimate
		and test models within the family of CUB models (where CUB
		stands for Combination of a discrete Uniform and a shifted
		Binomial distributions). The procedure is built upon Louis'
		identity for the observed information matrix. Best-subset
		variable selection is then implemented since it becomes more
		feasible from the computational point of view.
