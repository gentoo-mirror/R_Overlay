		Fast EM and Best-Subset Selection for CUB Models for Rating Data
		// For ordinal rating data, consider the accelerated
		Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate and test models
		within the family of CUB models (where CUB stands for
		Combination of a discrete Uniform and a shifted Binomial
		distributions). The procedure is built upon Louis' identity for
		the observed information matrix.  Best-subset variable
		selection for CUB regression models is then implemented on such
		basis. The methods here implemented are illustrated and
		discussed in the preprint available from Researchgate by Simone
		R. (2020) https://tinyurl.com/vvk563e.
