		Import, Assemble, and Deduplicate Bibliographic Datasets // A
		critical first step in systematic literature reviews and mining
		of academic texts is to identify relevant texts from a range of
		sources, particularly databases such as 'Web of Science' or
		'Scopus'. These databases often export in different formats or
		with different metadata tags. 'synthesisr' expands on the tools
		outlined by Westgate (2019) doi:10.1002/jrsm.1374 to import
		bibliographic data from a range of formats (such as 'bibtex',
		'ris', or 'ciw') in a standard way, and allows merging and
		deduplication of the resulting dataset.
