		Familiarity with Dataframes Before Data Manipulation // Real life
		data is muddy, fuzzy and unpredictable. This makes data
		manipulations tedious and bringing the data to right shape
		alone is a major chunk of work. Functions in this package help
		us get an understanding of dataframes to dramatically reduces
		data coding time.
