		Estimation and Diagnostics for Partially Linear Censored
		Regression Models Based on Heavy-Tailed Distributions // It
		estimates the parameters of a partially linear regression
		censored model via maximum penalized likelihood through of ECME
		algorithm. The model belong to the semiparametric class, that
		including a parametric and nonparametric component. The error
		term considered belongs to the scale-mixture of normal (SMN)
		distribution, that includes well-known heavy tails
		distributions as the Student-t distribution, among others. To
		examine the performance of the fitted model, case-deletion and
		local influence techniques are provided to show its robust
		aspect against outlying and influential observations. This work
		is based in Ferreira, C. S.,  Paula, G. A. (2017)
		doi:10.1080/02664763.2016.1267124 but considering the SMN
		family.
