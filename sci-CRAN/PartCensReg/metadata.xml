		Partially Censored Regression Models Based on Heavy-Tailed
		Distributions // It estimates the parameters of a partially
		censored regression model via maximum penalized likelihood
		through a iterative EM-type algorithm. The model must belong to
		the semi-parametric family, including a parametric and
		nonparametric component. The error term considered belongs to
		the scale-mixture of normal (SMN) distribution, that includes
		well-known heavy tails distributions as the student's-t
		distribution among others. To examine the performance of the
		fitted model, case-deletion and local influence techniques are
		provided to show its robust aspect against outlying and
		influential observations. This work is based in Ferreira, C.
		S.,  Paula, G. A. (2017) doi:10.1080/02664763.2016.1267124 but
		considering the SMN family.
