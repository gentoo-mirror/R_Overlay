		Simulation of Chromosomal Regions Shared by Family Members //
		Simulation of segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) by
		pedigree members. Using sex specific recombination rates along
		the human genome (Kong et. al (2010) doi:10.1038/nature09525),
		phased chromosomes are simulated for all pedigree members,
		either by unconditional gene dropping or conditional on a
		specified IBD pattern. Additional functions provide summaries
		and further analysis of the simulated genomes.
