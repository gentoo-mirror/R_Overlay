		Estimation, Variable Selection and Prediction for Functional
		Semiparametric Models // Routines for the estimation or
		simultaneous estimation and variable selection in several
		functional semiparametric models with scalar responses are
		provided. These models include the functional single-index
		model, the semi-functional partial linear model, and the semi-
		functional partial linear single-index model. Additionally, the
		package offers algorithms for handling scalar covariates with
		linear effects that originate from the discretization of a
		curve. This functionality is applicable in the context of the
		linear model, the multi-functional partial linear model, and
		the multi-functional partial linear single-index model.
