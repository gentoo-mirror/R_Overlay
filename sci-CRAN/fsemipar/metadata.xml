		Estimation, Variable Selection and Prediction for Functional
		Semiparametric Models // Routines for estimation or
		simultaneous estimation and variable selection of several
		functional semiparametric models with scalar response, such as
		the functional single-index model, the semi-functional partial
		linear model or the semi-functional partial linear single-index
		model. In addition, it includes algorithms for dealing with
		scalar covariates with linear effect coming from the
		discretization of a curve in the cases of the linear model, the
		multi-functional partial linear model and the multi-functional
		partial linear single-index model.
