		Dependent Censoring Regression Models // Dependent censoring
		regression models for survival multivariate data. These models
		are based on extensions of the frailty models, capable to
		accommodating the dependence between failure and censoring
		times, with Weibull and piecewise exponential marginal
		distributions. Theoretical details regarding the models
		implemented in the package can be found in Schneider et al.
