		Gaussian Linear Models with Linear Covariance Structure //
		Functions to fit Gaussian linear model by maximising the
		residual log likelihood where the covariance structure can be
		written as a linear combination of known matrices.  Can be used
		for multivariate models and random effects models.  Easy
		straight forward manner to specify random effects models,
		including random interactions. Code now optimised to use
		Sherman Morrison Woodbury identities for matrix inversion in
		random effects models. We've added the ability to fit models
		using any kernel as well as a function to return the mean and
		covariance of random effects conditional on the data (BLUPs).
