		Multiple Imputation Method in Survival Analysis // In clinical
		trials, endpoints are sometimes evaluated with uncertainty.
		Adjudication is commonly adopted to ensure the study integrity.
		We propose to use multiple imputation (MI) introduced by Robin
		(1987) doi:10.1002/9780470316696 to incorporate these
		uncertainties if reasonable event probabilities were provided.
		The method has been applied to Cox Proportional Hazard (PH)
		model, Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimation and Log-rank test in this
		package. Moreover, weighted estimations discussed in Cook
		(2004) doi:10.1016/S0197-2456(00)00053-2 were also implemented
		with weights calculated from event probabilities. In
		conclusion, this package can handle time-to-event analysis if
		events presented with uncertainty by different methods.
