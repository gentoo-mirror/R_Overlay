		Novel Statistical Test for Aberration Enrichment // Testing for
		heterogeneous effects in a case-control setting. The aim here
		to discover an association that is beyond a mean difference
		between all cases and all controls. Instead, the signal of
		interest here is present in only a proportion of the cases.
		This test should be more powerful than a t-test or Wilcoxon
		test in this heterogeneous setting. Please cite the
		corresponding paper: Mezlini et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1101/2020.03.23.002972.
