		Extension to 'tmap' for Creating Cartograms // Provides new layer
		functions to 'tmap' for creating various types of cartograms. A
		cartogram is a type of thematic map in which geographic areas
		are resized or distorted based on a quantitative variable, such
		as population. The goal is to make the area sizes proportional
		to the selected variable while preserving geographic positions
		as much as possible.
