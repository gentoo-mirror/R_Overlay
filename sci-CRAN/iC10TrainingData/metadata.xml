		Training Datasets for iC10 Package // Training datasets for iC10;
		which implements the classifier described in the paper 'Genome-
		driven integrated classification of breast cancer validated in
		over 7,500 samples' (Ali HR et al., Genome Biology 2014). It
		uses copy number and/or expression form breast cancer data,
		trains a pamr classifier (Tibshirani et al.) with the features
		available and predicts the iC10 group. Genomic annotation for
		the training dataset has been obtained from Mark Dunning's
		lluminaHumanv3.db package.
