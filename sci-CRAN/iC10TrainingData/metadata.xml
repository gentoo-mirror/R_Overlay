		Training datasets for iC10 package. // Training datasets for
		iC10; which implements the classifier described in the paper
		'Genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer
		validated in over 7,500 samples' (Ali HR et al., Genome Biology
		2014). It uses copy number and/or expression form breast cancer
		data, trains a pamr classifier (Tibshirani et al.) with the
		features available and predicts the iC10 group. Genomic
		annotation for the training dataset has been obtained from Mark
		Dunning's lluminaHumanv3.db package.
