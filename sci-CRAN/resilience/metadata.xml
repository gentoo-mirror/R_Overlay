		Predictors of Resilience to a Stressor in a Single-Arm Study //
		Studies of resilience in older adults employ a single-arm
		design where everyone experiences the stressor. The simplistic
		approach of regressing change versus baseline yields biased
		estimates due to regression-to-the-mean. This package provides
		a method to correct the bias. It also allows covariates to be
		included. The method implemented in the package is described in
		Varadhan, R., Zhu, J., and Bandeen-Roche, K (2023),
		Biostatistics (To appear).
