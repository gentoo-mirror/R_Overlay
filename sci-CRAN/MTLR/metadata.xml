		Survival Prediction with Multi-Task Logistic Regression // An
		implementation of Multi-Task Logistic Regression (MTLR) for R.
		This package is based on the method proposed by Yu et al.
		(2011) which utilized MTLR for generating individual survival
		curves by learning feature weights which vary across time. This
		model was further extended to account for left and interval
		censored data.
