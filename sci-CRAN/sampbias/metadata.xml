		Evaluating Geographic Sampling Bias in Biological Collections //
		Evaluating the biasing impact of geographic features such as
		airports, cities, roads, rivers in datasets of coordinates
		based biological collection datasets, by Bayesian estimation of
		the parameters of a Poisson process. Enables also spatial
		visualization of sampling bias and includes a set of
		convenience functions for publication level plotting. Also
		available as 'shiny' app. The reference for the methodology is:
