		Interaction Statistics // Fast, model-agnostic implementation of
		different H-statistics introduced by Jerome H. Friedman and
		Bogdan E. Popescu (2008) doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148.  These
		statistics quantify interaction strength per feature, feature
		pair, and feature triple.  The package supports multi-output
		predictions and can account for case weights. In addition,
		several variants of the original statistics are provided. The
		shape of the interactions can be explored through partial
		dependence plots or individual conditional expectation plots.
		'DALEX' explainers, meta learners ('mlr3', 'tidymodels',
		'caret') and most other models work out-of-the-box.
