		'caret' Applications for Spatial-Temporal Models // Supporting
		functionality to run 'caret' with spatial or spatial-temporal
		data. 'caret' is a frequently used package for model training
		and prediction using machine learning. CAST includes functions
		to improve spatial or spatial-temporal modelling tasks using
		'caret'. To decrease spatial overfitting and to improve model
		performances, the package implements a forward feature
		selection that selects suitable predictor variables in view to
		their contribution to spatial or spatial-temporal model
		performance. CAST further includes functionality to estimate
		the (spatial) area of applicability of prediction models.
		Methods are described in Meyer et al. (2018)
