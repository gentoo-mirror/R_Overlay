		'caret' Applications for Spatial-Temporal Models // Supporting
		functionality to run 'caret' with spatial or spatial-temporal
		data. 'caret' is a frequently used package for model training
		and prediction using machine learning. This package includes
		functions to improve spatial-temporal modelling tasks using
		'caret'. It prepares data for Leave-Location-Out and Leave-
		Time-Out cross-validation which are target-oriented validation
		strategies for spatial-temporal models. To decrease overfitting
		and improve model performances, the package implements a
		forward feature selection that selects suitable predictor
		variables in view to their contribution to the target-oriented
		performance. CAST further includes functionality to estimate
		the (spatial) area of applicability of prediction models by
		analysing the similarity between new data and training data.
