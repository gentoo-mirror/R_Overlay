		Programming with Big Data -- Base Wrappers for Distributed
		Matrices // An interface to and extensions for the 'PBLAS' and
		'ScaLAPACK' numerical libraries.  This enables R to utilize
		distributed linear algebra for codes written in the 'SPMD'
		fashion. This interface is deliberately low-level and mimics
		the style of the native libraries it wraps.  For a much higher
		level way of managing distributed matrices, see the 'pbdDMAT'
		package.
