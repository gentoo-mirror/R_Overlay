		Multivariate Nonparametric Methods // A collection of
		multivariate nonparametric methods, selected in part to support
		an MS level course in nonparametric statistical methods.
		Methods include adjustments for multiple comparisons,
		implementation of multivariate Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon testing,
		inversion of these tests to produce a confidence region, some
		permutation tests for linear models, and some algorithms for
		calculating exact probabilities associated with one- and two-
		stage testing involving Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistics.
		Supported by grant NSF DMS 1712839.
