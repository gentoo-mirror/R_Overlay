		Steve's Toy Data for Teaching About a Variety of Methodological,
		Social, and Political Topics // This is a collection of various
		kinds of data with broad uses for teaching. My students, and
		academics like me who teach the same topics I teach, should
		find this useful if their teaching workflow is also built
		around the R programming language. The applications are
		multiple but mostly cluster on topics of statistical
		methodology, international relations, and political economy.
