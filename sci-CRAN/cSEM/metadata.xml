		Composite-Based Structural Equation Modeling // Estimate, assess,
		test, and study linear, nonlinear, hierarchical and multigroup
		structural equation models using composite-based approaches and
		procedures, including estimation techniques such as partial
		least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and its derivatives (PLSc,
		ordPLSc, robustPLSc), generalized structured component analysis
		(GSCA), generalized structured component analysis with
		uniqueness terms (GSCAm), generalized canonical correlation
		analysis (GCCA), principal component analysis (PCA), factor
		score regression (FSR) using sum score, regression or bartlett
		scores (including bias correction using Croons approach), as
		well as several tests and typical postestimation procedures
		(e.g., verify admissibility of the estimates, assess the model
		fit, test the model fit etc.).
