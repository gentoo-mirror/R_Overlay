		Autocorrelation Regression Trees // A modified version of the
		classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm for
		modelling spatial data that features coordinate information.
		Coordinate information can be used to evaluate measures of
		spatial autocorrelation and spatial compactness during the
		splitting phase of the tree, leading to better predictions and
		more physically realistic predictions on these types of
		datasets. These methods are described in Ancell and Bean (2021)
		arXiv:2101.08258.
