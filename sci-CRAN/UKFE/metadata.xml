		UK Flood Estimation // Functions to implement the methods of the
		Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH), associated updates and the
		revitalised flood hydrograph model (ReFH). Currently the
		package uses NRFA peak flow dataset version 10. Aside from FEH
		functionality, further hydrological functions are available.
		Most of the methods implemented in this package are described
		in one or more of the following: "Flood Estimation Handbook",
		Centre for Ecology  Hydrology (1999, ISBN:0 948540 94 X).
