		A Tidy Implementation of the Synthetic Control Method // A
		synthetic control offers a way of evaluating the effect of an
		intervention in comparative case studies. The package makes a
		number of improvements when implementing the method in R. These
		improvements allow users to inspect, visualize, and tune the
		synthetic control more easily. A key benefit of a tidy
		implementation is that the entire preparation process for
		building the synthetic control can be accomplished in a single
		pipe. For more information on the synthetic control method, see
		Abadie et al. (2003) doi:10.1257/000282803321455188.
