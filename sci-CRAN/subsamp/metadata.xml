		Subsample Winner Algorithm for Variable Selection in Linear
		Regression with a Large Number of Variables // This subsample
		winner algorithm (SWA) for regression with a large-p data (X,
		Y) selects the important variables (or features) among the p
		features X in explaining the response Y.  The SWA first uses a
		base procedure,  here a linear regression, on each of
		subsamples randomly drawn from the p variables, and then
		computes the scores of all features, i.e., the p variables,
		according to the performance of these features collected in
		each of the subsample analyses. It then obtains the
		'semifinalist' of the features based on the resulting scores
		and determines the 'finalists', i.e., the important features,
		from the 'semifinalist'.  Fan, Sun and Qiao (2017)
