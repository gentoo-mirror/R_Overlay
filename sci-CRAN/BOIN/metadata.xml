		Bayesian Optimal INterval (BOIN) Design for Single-Agent and
		Drug- Combination Phase I Clinical Trials // The Bayesian
		optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I clinical
		trial design for finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It
		can be used to design both single-agent and drug-combination
		trials. The BOIN design is motivated by the top priority and
		concern of clinicians when testing a new drug, which is to
		effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing
		them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. The prominent
		advantage of the BOIN design is that it achieves simplicity and
		superior performance at the same time. The BOIN design is
		algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way similar
		to the traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields an
		average performance that is comparable to that of the continual
		reassessment method (CRM, one of the best model-based designs)
		in terms of selecting the MTD, but has a substantially lower
		risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic
		doses. For tutorial, please check Yan et al. (2020)
