		Predicts a smooth and continuous (individual) utility function
		from utility points, and computes measures of intensity for
		risk and higher-order risk measures (or any other measure
		computed with user-written function) based on this utility
		function and its derivatives according to the method introduced
		in Schneider (2017)
