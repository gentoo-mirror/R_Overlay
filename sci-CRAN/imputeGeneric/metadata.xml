		Ease the Implementation of Imputation Methods // The general
		workflow of most imputation methods is quite similar. The aim
		of this package is to provide parts of this general workflow to
		make the implementation of imputation methods easier. The heart
		of an imputation method is normally the used model. These
		models can be defined using the 'parsnip' package or customized
		specifications. The rest of an imputation method are more
		technical specification e.g. which columns and rows should be
		used for imputation and in which order. These technical
		specifications can be set inside the imputation functions.
