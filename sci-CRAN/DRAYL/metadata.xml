		Computation of Rayleigh Densities of Arbitrary Dimension // We
		offer an implementation of the series representation put forth
		in "A series representation for multidimensional Rayleigh
		distributions" by Wiegand and Nadarajah DOI: 10.1002/dac.3510.
		Furthermore we have implemented an integration approach
		proposed by Beaulieu et al. for 3 and 4-dimensional Rayleigh
		densities (Beaulieu, Zhang,  "New simplest exact forms for the
		3D and 4D multivariate Rayleigh PDFs with applications to
		antenna array geometrics", DOI: 10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2709307).
