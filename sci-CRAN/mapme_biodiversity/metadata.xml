		Efficient Monitoring of Global Biodiversity Portfolios //
		Biodiversity areas, especially primary forest, serve a
		multitude of functions for local economy, regional
		functionality of the ecosystems as well as the global health of
		our planet. Recently, adverse changes in human land use
		practices and climatic responses to increased greenhouse gas
		emissions, put these biodiversity areas under a variety of
		different threats. The present package helps to analyse a
		number of biodiversity indicators based on freely available
		geographical datasets. It supports computational efficient
		routines that allow the analysis of potentially global
		biodiversity portfolios. The primary use case of the package is
		to support evidence based reporting of an organization's effort
		to protect biodiversity areas under threat and to identify
		regions were intervention is most duly needed.
