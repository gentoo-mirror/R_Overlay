		A Collection of Tools to Conduct Levins' Loop Analysis //
		Performs Levins' loop analysis of qualitatively-specified
		complex causal systems. Loop analysis makes qualitative
		predictions of variable change in a system of causally
		interdependent variables, where "qualitative" means direct
		causal relationships and indirect causal effects are coded as
		sign only (i.e. increases, decreases, no change, and
		ambiguous). This implementation includes output support for
		graphs in .dot file format for use with visualization software
		such as 'graphviz' (https://graphviz.org). 'LoopAnalyst'
		provides tools for the construction and output of community
		matrices, computation and output of community effect matrices,
		tables of correlations, adjoint, absolute feedback, weighted
		feedback and weighted prediction matrices, change in life
		expectancy matrices, and feedback, path and loop enumeration
		tools.
