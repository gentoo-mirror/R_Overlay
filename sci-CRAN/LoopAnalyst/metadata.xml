		A collection of tools to conduct Levins' Loop Analysis // Loop
		analysis makes qualitative predictions of variable change in a
		system of causally interdependent variables, where
		"qualitative" means sign only (i.e. increases, decreases, non
		change, and ambiguous). This implementation includes output
		support for graphs in .dot file format for use with
		visualization software such as graphviz (graphviz.org). Loop
		Analyst provides tools for the construction and output of
		community matrices, computation and output of community effect
		matrices, tables of correlations, adjoint, absolute feedback,
		weighted feedback and weighted prediction matrices, change in
		life expectancy matrices, and feedback, path and loop
		enumeration tools.
