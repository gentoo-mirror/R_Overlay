		Correction of the pvalue after multiple coding // We propose to
		determine the correction of the significance level after
		multiple coding of an explanatory variable in Generalized
		Linear Model. The different methods of correction of the
		p-value are the Single step Bonferroni procedure, and
		resampling based methods developped by P.H.Westfall in 1993.
		Resampling methods are based on the permutation and the
		parametric bootstrap procedure. If some continuous, and
		dichotomous transformations are performed this package offers
		an exact correction of the p-value developped by B.Liquet
		D.Commenges in 2005. The naive method with no correction is
		also available.
