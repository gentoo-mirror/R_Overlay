		Correction of the P-Value after Multiple Coding in Generalized
		Linear Models // We propose to determine the correction of the
		significance level after multiple coding of an explanatory
		variable in Generalized Linear Model. The different methods of
		correction of the p-value are the Single step Bonferroni
		procedure, and resampling based methods developed by
		P.H.Westfall in 1993. Resampling methods are based on the
		permutation and the parametric bootstrap procedure. If some
		continuous, and dichotomous transformations are performed this
		package offers an exact correction of the p-value developed by
		B.Liquet  D.Commenges in 2005. The naive method with no
		correction is also available.
