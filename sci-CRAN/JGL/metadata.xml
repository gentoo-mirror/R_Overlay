		Performs the Joint Graphical Lasso for Sparse Inverse Covariance
		Estimation on Multiple Classes // The Joint Graphical Lasso is
		a generalized method for estimating Gaussian graphical models/
		sparse inverse covariance matrices/ biological networks on
		multiple classes of data.  We solve JGL under two penalty
		functions: The Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL), which employs a
		fused penalty to encourage inverse covariance matrices to be
		similar across classes, and the Group Graphical Lasso (GGL),
		which encourages similar network structure between classes.
		FGL is recommended over GGL for most applications. Reference:
