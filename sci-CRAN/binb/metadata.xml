		'binb' is not 'Beamer' // A collection of 'LaTeX' styles using
		'Beamer' customization for pdf-based presentation slides in
		'RMarkdown'. At present it contains 'RMarkdown' adaptations of
		the LaTeX themes 'Metropolis' (formerly 'mtheme') theme by
		Matthias Vogelgesang and others (now included in 'TeXLive'),
		and the 'IQSS' by Ista Zahn (which is included here).
		Additional (free) fonts may be needed: 'Metropolis' prefers
		'Fira', and 'IQSS' requires 'Libertinus'.
