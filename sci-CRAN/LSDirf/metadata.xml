		Impulse-Response Function Analysis for Agent-Based Models //
		Performing impulse-response function (IRF) analysis of relevant
		variables of agent-based simulation models, in particular for
		models described in 'LSD' format. Based on the data produced by
		the simulation model, it performs both linear and state-
		dependent IRF analysis, providing the tools required by the
		Counterfactual Monte Carlo (CMC) methodology (Amendola and
		Pereira (2024) doi:10.2139/ssrn.4740360), including state
		identification and sensitivity. CMC proposes retrieving the
		causal effect of shocks by exploiting the opportunity to
		directly observe the counterfactual in a fully controlled
		experimental setup. 'LSD' (Laboratory for Simulation
		Development) is free software available at
		https://www.labsimdev.org/).
