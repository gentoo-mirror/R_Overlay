		Computing Subscores in Classical Test Theory and Item Response
		Theory // Functions for computing test subscores using
		different methods in both classical test theory (CTT) and item
		response theory (IRT). This package enables three types of
		subscoring methods within the framework of CTT and IRT,
		including (1) Wainer's augmentation method (Wainer et. al.,
		2001) doi:10.4324/9781410604729, (2) Haberman's subscoring
		methods (Haberman, 2008) doi:10.3102/1076998607302636, and (3)
		Yen's objective performance index (OPI; Yen, 1987) https://www.
		ets.org/research/policy_research_reports/publications/paper/198
		7/hrap. It also includes functions to compute Proportional
		Reduction of Mean Squared Errors (PRMSEs) in Haberman's methods
		which are used to examine whether test subscores are of added
		value. In addition, the package includes a function to assess
		the local independence assumption of IRT with Yen's Q3
		statistic (Yen, 1984 doi:10.1177/014662168400800201; Yen, 1993
		doi:10.1111/j.1745-3984.1993.tb00423.x).
