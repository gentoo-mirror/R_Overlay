		Naive Bayes Transmission Analysis // Estimates the relative
		transmission probabilities between cases in an infectious
		disease outbreak or cluster using naive Bayes. Included are
		various functions to use these probabilities to estimate
		transmission parameters such as the generation/serial interval
		and reproductive number as well as finding the contribution of
		covariates to the probabilities and visualizing results. The
		ideal use is for an infectious disease dataset with metadata on
		the majority of cases but more informative data such as contact
		tracing or pathogen whole genome sequencing on only a subset of
		cases. For a detailed description of the methods see Leavitt et
		al. (2020) doi:10.1093/ije/dyaa031.
