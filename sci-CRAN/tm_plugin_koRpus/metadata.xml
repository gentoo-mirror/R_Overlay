		Full Corpus Support for the 'koRpus' Package // Enhances 'koRpus'
		text object classes and methods to also support large corpora.
		Hierarchical ordering of corpus texts into arbitrary categories
		will be preserved. Provided classes and methods also improve
		the ability of using the 'koRpus' package together with the
		'tm' package. To ask for help, report bugs, suggest feature
		improvements, or discuss the global development of the package,
		please subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list
		(https://korpusml.reaktanz.de).
