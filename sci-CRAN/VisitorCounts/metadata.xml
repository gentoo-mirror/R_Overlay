		Modeling and Forecasting Visitor Counts Using Social Media //
		Performs modeling and forecasting of park visitor counts using
		social media data and (partial) on-site visitor counts.
		Specifically, the model is built based on an automatic
		decomposition of the trend and seasonal components of the
		social media-based park visitor counts, from which short-term
		forecasts of the visitor counts and percent changes in the
		visitor counts can be made. A reference for the underlying
		model that 'VisitorCounts' uses can be found at Russell Goebel,
		Austin Schmaltz, Beth Ann Brackett, Spencer A. Wood, Kimihiro
		Noguchi (2023) doi:10.1002/for.2965 .
