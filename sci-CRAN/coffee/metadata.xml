		Chronological Ordering for Fossils and Environmental Events //
		While individual calibrated radiocarbon dates can span several
		centuries, combining multiple dates together with any
		chronological constraints can make a chronology much more
		robust and precise. This package uses Bayesian methods to
		enforce the chronological ordering of radiocarbon and other
		dates, for example for trees with multiple radiocarbon dates
		spaced at exactly known intervals (e.g., 10 annual rings). For
		methods see Christen 2003 doi:10.11141/ia.13.2. Another example
		is sites where the relative chronological position of the dates
		is taken into account - the ages of dates further down a site
		must be older than those of dates further up (Buck, Kenworthy,
		Litton and Smith 1991 doi:10.1017/S0003598X00080534; Nicholls
		and Jones 2001 doi:10.1111/1467-9876.00250). The paper
		accompanying this R package is Blaauw et al. 2024
		doi:10.1017/RDC.2024.56.
