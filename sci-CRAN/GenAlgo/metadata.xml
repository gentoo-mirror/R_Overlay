		Classes and Methods to Use Genetic Algorithms for Feature
		Selection // Defines classes and methods that can be used to
		implement genetic algorithms for feature selection.  The idea
		is that we want to select a fixed number of features to combine
		into a linear classifier that can predict a binary outcome, and
		can use a genetic algorithm heuristically to select an optimal
		set of features.
