		K-means clustering with build-in missing data imputation // This
		k-means algorithm is able to cluster data with missing values
		and as a by-product completes the data set. The implementation
		can deal with missing values in multiple variables and is
		computationally efficient since it iteratively uses the current
		cluster assignment to define a plausible distribution for
		missing value imputation. Weights are used to shrink early
		random draws for missing values (i.e., draws based on the
		cluster assignments after few iterations) towards the global
		mean of each feature. This shrinkage slowly fades out after a
		fixed number of iterations to reflect the increasing
		credibility of cluster assignments. See the vignette for
		details.
