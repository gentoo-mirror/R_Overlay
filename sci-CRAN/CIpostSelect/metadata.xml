		Confidence Interval Post-Selection of Variable // Calculates
		confidence intervals after variable selection using repeated
		data splits. The package offers methods to address the
		challenges of post-selection inference, ensuring more accurate
		confidence intervals in models involving variable selection.
		The two main functions are 'lmps', which records the different
		models selected across multiple data splits as well as the
		corresponding coefficient estimates, and 'cips', which takes
		the lmps object as input to select variables and perform
		inferences using two types of voting.
