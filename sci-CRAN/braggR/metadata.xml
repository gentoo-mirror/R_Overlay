		Calculate the Revealed Aggregator of Probability Predictions //
		Forecasters predicting the chances of a future event may
		disagree due to differing evidence or noise. To harness the
		collective evidence of the crowd, Ville Satop (2021)
		"Regularized Aggregation of One-off Probability Predictions"
		https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3769945
		proposes a Bayesian aggregator that is regularized by analyzing
		the forecasters' disagreement and ascribing over-dispersion to
		noise. This aggregator requires no user intervention and can be
		computed efficiently even for a large numbers of predictions.
		The author evaluates the aggregator on subjective probability
		predictions collected during a four-year forecasting tournament
		sponsored by the US intelligence community. The aggregator
		improves the accuracy of simple averaging by around 20% and
		other state-of-the-art aggregators by 10-25%. The advantage
		stems almost exclusively from improved calibration. This
		aggregator -- know as "the revealed aggregator" -- inputs a)
		forecasters' probability predictions (p) of a future binary
		event and b) the forecasters' base rate (p0) of the future
		event. In this R-package, the function
		sample_aggregator(p,p0,...) allows the user to calculate the
		revealed aggregator. Its use is illustrated with a simple
		stylized example.
