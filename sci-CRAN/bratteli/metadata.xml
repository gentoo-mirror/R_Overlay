		Deal with Bratteli Graphs // Utilities for Bratteli graphs. A
		tree is an example of a Bratteli graph. The package provides a
		function which generates a 'LaTeX' file that renders the given
		Bratteli graph. It also provides functions to compute the
		dimensions of the vertices, the intrinsic kernels and the
		intrinsic distances. Intrinsic kernels and distances were
		introduced by Vershik (2014) doi:10.1007/s10958-014-1958-0.
