		Bayesian Longitudinal Regularized Quantile Mixed Model // With
		high-dimensional omics features, repeated measure ANOVA leads
		to longitudinal gene-environment interaction studies that have
		intra-cluster correlations, outlying observations and
		structured sparsity arising from the ANOVA design. In this
		package, we have developed robust sparse Bayesian mixed effect
		models tailored for the above studies (Fan et al. (2025)
		doi:10.1093/jrsssc/qlaf027). An efficient Gibbs sampler has
		been developed to facilitate fast computation. The Markov chain
		Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and alternative methods
		are efficiently implemented in 'C++'. The development of this
		software package and the associated statistical methods have
		been partially supported by an Innovative Research Award from
		Johnson Cancer Research Center, Kansas State University.
