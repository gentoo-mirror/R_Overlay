		Bayesian Longitudinal Regularized Quantile Mixed Model // In
		longitudinal studies, the same subjects are measured repeatedly
		over time, leading to correlations among the repeated
		measurements. Properly accounting for the intra-cluster
		correlations in the presence of data heterogeneity and long
		tailed distributions of the disease phenotype is challenging,
		especially in the context of high dimensional regressions. In
		this package, we developed a Bayesian quantile mixed effects
		model with spike- and -slab priors to dissect important gene -
		environment interactions under longitudinal genomics studies.
		An efficient Gibbs sampler has been developed to facilitate
		fast computation. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of
		the proposed and alternative methods are efficiently
		implemented in 'C++'. The development of this software package
		and the associated statistical methods have been partially
		supported by an Innovative Research Award from Johnson Cancer
		Research Center, Kansas State University.
