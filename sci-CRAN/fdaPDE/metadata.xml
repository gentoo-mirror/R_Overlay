		Physics-Informed Spatial and Functional Data Analysis // An
		implementation of regression models with partial differential
		regularizations, making use of the Finite Element Method. The
		models efficiently handle data distributed over irregularly
		shaped domains and can comply with various conditions at the
		boundaries of the domain. A priori information about the
		spatial structure of the phenomenon under study can be
		incorporated in the model via the differential regularization.
		See Sangalli, L. M. (2021) doi:10.1111/insr.12444 "Spatial
		Regression With Partial Differential Equation Regularisation"
		for an overview. The release 1.1-9 requires R (= 4.2.0) to be
		installed on windows machines.
