		An Amazing Fast Way to Fit Elastic Net // Fit Elastic Net, Lasso,
		and Ridge regression and do cross-validation in a fast way. We
		build the algorithm based on Least Angle Regression by Bradley
		Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone, etc.
		(2004)(doi:10.1214/009053604000000067 ) and some algorithms
		like Givens rotation and Forward/Back Substitution. In this
		way, many matrices to be computed are retained as triangular
		matrices which can eventually speed up the computation. The
		fitting algorithm for Elastic Net is written in C++ using
		Armadillo linear algebra library.
