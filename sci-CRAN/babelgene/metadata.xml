		Gene Orthologs for Model Organisms in a Tidy Data Format //
		Genomic analysis of model organisms often requires the use of
		databases based on human data or making comparisons to patient-
		derived resources. This requires converting genes between human
		and non-human analogues. The babelgene R package provides
		predicted gene orthologs/homologs for frequently studied model
		organisms in an R-friendly tidy/long format. The package
		integrates orthology assertion predictions sourced from
		multiple databases as compiled by the HGNC Comparison of
		Orthology Predictions (HCOP) (Wright et al. 2005
