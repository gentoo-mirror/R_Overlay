		Sequential Quadratic Programming for Fast Maximum-Likelihood
		Estimation of Mixture Proportions // Provides an optimization
		method based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for
		maximum likelihood estimation of the mixture proportions in a
		finite mixture model where the component densities are known.
		The algorithm is expected to obtain solutions that are at least
		as accurate as the state-of-the-art MOSEK interior-point solver
		(called by function "KWDual" in the 'REBayes' package), and
		they are expected to arrive at solutions more quickly when the
		number of samples is large and the number of mixture components
		is small. This implements the "mix-SQP" algorithm (without the
		low-rank approximation) described in Y. Kim, P. Carbonetto, M.
		Stephens  M. Anitescu (2018) arXiv:1806.01412.
