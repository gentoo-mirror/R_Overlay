		Sequential Quadratic Programming for Fast Maximum-Likelihood
		Estimation of Mixture Proportions // Provides optimization
		algorithms based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for
		maximum likelihood estimation of the mixture proportions in a
		finite mixture model where the component densities are known.
		The algorithms are expected to obtain solutions that are at
		least as accurate as the state-of-the-art MOSEK interior-point
		solver (called by function "KWDual" in the 'REBayes' package),
		and they are expected to arrive at solutions more quickly in
		large data sets. The algorithms are described in Y. Kim, P.
		Carbonetto, M. Stephens  M. Anitescu (2012) arXiv:1806.01412.
