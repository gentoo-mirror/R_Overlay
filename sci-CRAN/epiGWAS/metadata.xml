		Robust Methods for Epistasis Detection // Functions to perform
		robust epistasis detection in genome-wide association studies,
		as described in Slim et al. (2018) doi:10.1101/442749. The
		implemented methods identify pairwise interactions between a
		particular target variant and the rest of the genotype, using a
		propensity score approach. The propensity score models the
		linkage disequilibrium between the target and the rest of the
		genotype. All methods are penalized regression approaches,
		which differently incorporate the propensity score to only
		recover the synergistic effects between the target and the
		genotype.
