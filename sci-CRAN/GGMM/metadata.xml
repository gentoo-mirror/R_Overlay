		Mixture Gaussian Graphical Models // The Gaussian graphical model
		is a widely used tool for learning gene regulatory networks
		with high-dimensional gene expression data. For many real
		problems, the data are heterogeneous, which may contain some
		subgroups or come from different resources. This package
		provide a Gaussian Graphical Mixture Model (GGMM) for the
		heterogeneous data. You can refer to Jia, B. and Liang, F.
		(2018) at arXiv:1805.02547 for detail.
