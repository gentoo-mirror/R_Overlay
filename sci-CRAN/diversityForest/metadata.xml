		Diversity Forests // Implements diversity forests as described in
		an upcoming paper by the author of the package. This package is
		a fork of the R package 'ranger' (main author: Marvin N.
		Wright) that implements random forests using an efficient C++
		implementation. More precisely, 'diversityForest' was written
		by modifying the code of 'ranger', version 0.11.0. Therefore,
		details on further functionalities of the code that are not
		presented in the help pages of 'diversityForest' are found in
		the help pages of 'ranger' (version 0.11.0). The code in the
		example sections of the 'diversityForest' manual can be used as
		a template for all basic application scenarios with respect to
		classification, regression and survival prediction using
		univariate, binary splitting. Some function arguments adopted
		from the 'ranger' package are not be useable with diversity
		forests (for the current package version).
