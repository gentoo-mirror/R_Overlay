		Innovative Complex Split Procedures in Random Forests Through
		Candidate Split Sampling // Implements interaction forests [1],
		which are specific diversity forests and the basic form of
		diversity forests that uses univariable, binary splitting [2].
		Interaction forests (IFs) are ensembles of decision trees that
		model quantitative and qualitative interaction effects using
		bivariable splitting. IFs come with the Effect Importance
		Measure (EIM), which can be used to identify variable pairs
		that feature quantitative and qualitative interaction effects
		with high predictive relevance. IFs and EIM focus on well
		interpretable forms of interactions. The package also offers
		plot functions for visualising the estimated forms of
		interaction effects. Categorical, metric, and survival outcomes
		are supported. This is a fork of the R package 'ranger' (main
		author: Marvin N. Wright) that implements random forests using
		an efficient C++  implementation. References: [1] Hornung, R.
