		Innovative Complex Split Procedures in Random Forests Through
		Candidate Split Sampling // Implementations of three diversity
		forest (DF) (Hornung, 2022, doi:10.1007/s42979-021-00920-1)
		variants. The DF algorithm is a split-finding approach that
		allows complex split procedures to be realized in random forest
		variants. The three DF variants implemented are: 1. interaction
		forests (IFs) (Hornung  Boulesteix, 2022,
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2022.107460): Model quantitative and
		qualitative interaction effects using bivariable splitting.
		Come with the Effect Importance Measure (EIM), which can be
		used to identify variable pairs that have well-interpretable
		quantitative and qualitative interaction effects with high
		predictive relevance. 2. multi forests (MuFs) (Hornung
		Hapfelmeier, 2024, doi:10.48550/arXiv.2409.08925): Model multi-
		class outcomes using multi-way and binary splitting. Come with
		two variable importance measures (VIMs): The multi-class VIM
		measures the degree to which the variables are specifically
		associated with one or more outcome classes, and the
		discriminatory VIM, similar to conventional VIMs, measures the
		overall influence strength of the variables. 3. the basic form
		of diversity forests that uses conventional univariable, binary
		splitting (Hornung, 2022). Except for multi forests, which are
		tailored for multi-class outcomes, all included diversity
		forest variants support categorical, metric, and survival
		outcomes. The package also includes plotting functions that
		make it possible to learn about the forms of the effects
		identified using IFs and MuFs. This is a fork of the R package
		'ranger' (main author: Marvin N. Wright), which implements
		random forests using an efficient C++ implementation.
