		Innovative Complex Split Procedures in Random Forests Through
		Candidate Split Sampling // Implementation of three methods
		based on the diversity forest (DF) algorithm (Hornung, 2022,
		doi:10.1007/s42979-021-00920-1), a split-finding approach that
		enables complex split procedures in random forests. The package
		includes: 1. Interaction forests (IFs) (Hornung  Boulesteix,
		2022, doi:10.1016/j.csda.2022.107460): Model quantitative and
		qualitative interaction effects using bivariable splitting.
		Come with the Effect Importance Measure (EIM), which can be
		used to identify variable pairs that have well-interpretable
		quantitative and qualitative interaction effects with high
		predictive relevance. 2. Two random forest-based variable
		importance measures (VIMs) for multi-class outcomes: the class-
		focused VIM, which ranks covariates by their ability to
		distinguish individual outcome classes from the others, and the
		discriminatory VIM, which measures overall covariate influence
		irrespective of class-specific relevance. 3. The basic form of
		diversity forests that uses conventional univariable, binary
		splitting (Hornung, 2022). Except for the multi-class VIMs, all
		methods support categorical, metric, and survival outcomes. The
		package includes visualization tools for interpreting the
		identified covariate effects. Built as a fork of the 'ranger' R
		package (main author: Marvin N. Wright), which implements
		random forests using an efficient C++ implementation.
