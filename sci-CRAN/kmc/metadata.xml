		Kaplan-Meier Estimator with Constraints for Right Censored Data
		-- a Recursive Computational Algorithm // Given constraints for
		right censored data, we use a recursive computational algorithm
		to calculate the the "constrained" Kaplan-Meier estimator. The
		constraint is assumed given in linear estimating equations or
		mean functions. We also illustrate how this leads to the
		empirical likelihood ratio test with right censored data and
		accelerated failure time model with given coefficients. EM
		algorithm from emplik package is used to get the initial value.
		The properties and performance of the EM algorithm is discussed
		in Mai Zhou and Yifan Yang (2015)doi: 10.1007/s00180-015-0567-9
		and Mai Zhou and Yifan Yang (2017) 10.1002/wics.1400. More
		applications could be found in Mai Zhou (2015) doi:
		10.1201/b18598.
