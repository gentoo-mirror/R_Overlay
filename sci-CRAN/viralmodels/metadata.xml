		Viral Load and CD4 Lymphocytes Regression Models // Provides a
		comprehensive framework for building, evaluating, and
		visualizing regression models for analyzing viral load and CD4
		(Cluster of Differentiation 4) lymphocytes data. It leverages
		the principles of the tidymodels ecosystem of Max Kuhn and
		Hadley Wickham (2020) https://www.tidymodels.org to offer a
		user-friendly experience in model development. This package
		includes functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering,
		model training, tuning, and evaluation, along with
		visualization tools to enhance the interpretation of model
		results. It is specifically designed for researchers in
		biostatistics, computational biology, and HIV research who aim
		to perform reproducible and rigorous analyses to gain insights
		into disease dynamics. The main focus is on improving the
		understanding of the relationships between viral load, CD4
		lymphocytes, and other relevant covariates to contribute to HIV
		research and the visibility of vulnerable seropositive
		populations.
