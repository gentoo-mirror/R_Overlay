		Meta Clustering with Similarity Network Fusion // Framework to
		facilitate patient subtyping with similarity network fusion and
		meta clustering. The similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm
		was introduced by Wang et al. (2014) in doi:10.1038/nmeth.2810.
		SNF is a data integration approach that can transform high-
		dimensional and diverse data types into a single similarity
		network suitable for clustering with minimal loss of
		information from each initial data source. The meta clustering
		approach was introduced by Caruana et al. (2006) in
		doi:10.1109/ICDM.2006.103. Meta clustering involves generating
		a wide range of cluster solutions by adjusting clustering
		hyperparameters, then clustering the solutions themselves into
		a manageable number of qualitatively similar solutions, and
		finally characterizing representative solutions to find ones
		that are best for the user's specific context. This package
		provides a framework to easily transform multi-modal data into
		a wide range of similarity network fusion-derived cluster
		solutions as well as to visualize, characterize, and validate
		those solutions. Core package functionality includes easy
		customization of distance metrics, clustering algorithms, and
		SNF hyperparameters to generate diverse clustering solutions;
		calculation and plotting of associations between features,
		between patients, and between cluster solutions; and standard
		cluster validation approaches including resampled measures of
		cluster stability, standard metrics of cluster quality, and
		label propagation to evaluate generalizability in unseen data.
		Associated vignettes guide the user through using the package
		to identify patient subtypes while adhering to best practices
		for unsupervised learning.
