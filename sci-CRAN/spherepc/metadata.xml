		Spherical Principal Curves // Fitting a principal curve to data
		lying in the spherical surface. This package provides principal
		circle, principal geodesic analysis, Hauberg's principal
		curves, and spherical principal curves. Moreover, it offers
		locally defined principal geodesics which are currently under
		study. The detailed procedures are described in Jang-Hyun Kim,
		Jongmin Lee and Hee-Seok Oh (2020) arXiv:2003.02578.
