		Spherical Principal Curves // Fitting dimension reduction methods
		to data lying on two-dimensional sphere. This package provides
		principal circle, principal geodesic analysis, Hauberg's
		principal curves, and spherical principal curves. Moreover, it
		offers the method of locally defined principal geodesics which
		is underway.The detailed procedures are described in Lee, J.,
		Kim, J.-H. and Oh, H.-S. (2021) doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3025327.
