		Optimum Sample Allocation in Stratified Sampling Schemes //
		Functions in this package provide solution to classical problem
		in survey methodology - an optimum sample allocation in
		stratified sampling. In this context, the optimal allocation is
		in the classical Tschuprov-Neyman's sense and it satisfies
		additional lower or upper bounds restrictions imposed on sample
		sizes in strata. There are few different algorithms available
		to use, and one them is based on popular sample allocation
		method that applies Neyman allocation to recursively reduced
		set of strata. This package also provides the function that
		computes a solution to the minimum cost allocation problem,
		which is a minor modification of the classical optimium sample
		allocation. This problem lies in the determination of a vector
		of strata sample sizes that minimizes total cost of the survey,
		under assumed fixed level of the stratified estimator's
		variance. As in the case of the classical optimal allocation,
		the problem of minimum cost allocation can be complemented by
		imposing upper-bounds constraints on sample sizes in strata.
