		Optimum Sample Allocation in Stratified Random Sampling Scheme //
		Functions in this package provide solution to classical problem
		in survey methodology - an optimum sample allocation in
		stratified sampling scheme with simple random sampling without
		replacement design in each stratum. In this context, the
		optimal allocation is in the classical Tschuprow-Neyman's
		sense, and it satisfies additional upper bounds restrictions
		imposed on sample sizes in strata. There are four different
		algorithms available to use, and one of them is Neyman optimal
		allocation applied in a recursive way. All the algorithms are
		described in detail in "Wojciak W. Optimal allocation in
		stratified sampling schemes. Master's diploma thesis, Warsaw
		University of Technology. 2019", available on-line at http://ho
		me.elka.pw.edu.pl/~wwojciak/msc_optimal_allocation.pdf.
