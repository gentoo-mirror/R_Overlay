		Genomic Annotation in Livestock for Positional Candidate LOci //
		The accurate annotation of genes and Quantitative Trait Loci
		(QTLs) located within candidate markers and/or regions
		(haplotypes, windows, CNVs, etc) is a crucial step the most
		common genomic analyses performed in livestock, such as Genome-
		Wide Association Studies or transcriptomics. The Genomic
		Annotation in Livestock for positional candidate LOci (GALLO)
		is an R package designed to provide an intuitive and
		straightforward environment to annotate positional candidate
		genes and QTLs from high-throughput genetic studies in
		livestock. Moreover, GALLO allows the graphical visualization
		of gene and QTL annotation results, data comparison among
		different grouping factors (e.g., methods, breeds, tissues,
		statistical models, studies, etc.), and QTL enrichment in
		different livestock species including cattle, pigs, sheep, and
		chicken, among others.
