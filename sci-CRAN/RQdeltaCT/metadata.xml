		Relative Quantification of Gene Expression using Delta Ct Methods
		// The commonly used methods for relative quantification of
		gene expression are the delta Ct family methods (encompassing
		2^-Ct, 2^-dCt, and 2^-ddCt methods), originally proposed by
		Kenneth J. Livak and Thomas D. Schmittgen (2001)
		doi:10.1006/meth.2001.1262. These methods were designed to
		analyse gene expression data (Ct values) obtained from qPCR
		(quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) experiments. The main
		idea is to normalise gene expression values using endogenous
		control gene, present gene expression levels in linear form by
		using the 2^-(value)^ transformation, and calculate differences
		in gene expression levels between groups of samples (or
		technical replicates of a single sample). The 'RQdeltaCT'
		package offers functions that encompass all of these steps for
		comparison of either independent groups of samples or groups
		with paired samples, together with importing qPCR datasets,
		performing multi-step quality control of data, enabling
		numerous data visualisations, enrichment of the standard
		workflow with additional useful analyses (correlation analysis,
		Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis, logistic
		regression), and conveniently export obtained results in table
		and image formats. The package has been designed to be friendly
		to non-experts in R programming users.
