		Relative Quantification of Gene Expression using Delta Ct Methods
		// The commonly used methods for relative quantification of
		gene expression levels obtained in real-time PCR (Polymerase
		Chain Reaction) experiments are the delta Ct methods,
		encompassing 2^-dCt and 2^-ddCt methods, originally proposed by
		Kenneth J. Livak and Thomas D. Schmittgen (2001)
		doi:10.1006/meth.2001.1262. The main idea is to normalise gene
		expression values using endogenous control gene, present gene
		expression levels in linear form by using the 2^-(value)^
		transformation, and calculate differences in gene expression
		levels between groups of samples (or technical replicates of a
		single sample). The 'RQdeltaCT' package offers functions that
		cover both methods for comparison of either independent groups
		of samples or groups with paired samples, together with
		importing expression datasets, performing multi-step quality
		control of data, enabling numerous data visualisations,
		enrichment of the standard workflow with additional useful
		analyses (correlation analysis, Receiver Operating
		Characteristic analysis, logistic regression), and conveniently
		export obtained results in table and image formats. The package
		has been designed to be friendly to non-experts in R
		programming.
