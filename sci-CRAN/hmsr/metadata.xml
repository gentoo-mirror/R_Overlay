		Multipopulation Evolutionary Strategy HMS // The HMS (Hierarchic
		Memetic Strategy) is a composite global optimization strategy
		consisting of a multi-population evolutionary strategy and some
		auxiliary methods. The HMS makes use of a dynamically-evolving
		data structure that provides an organization among the
		component populations. It is a tree with a fixed maximal height
		and variable internal node degree. Each component population is
		governed by a particular evolutionary engine. This package
		provides a simple R implementation with examples of using
		different genetic algorithms as the population engines.
