		Dictionary-Based Sentiment Analysis // Performs a sentiment
		analysis of textual contents in R. This implementation utilizes
		various existing dictionaries, such as Harvard IV, or finance-
		specific dictionaries. Furthermore, it can also create
		customized dictionaries. The latter uses LASSO regularization
		as a statistical approach to select relevant terms based on an
		exogenous response variable.
