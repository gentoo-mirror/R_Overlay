		Genomic Breeding Tools: Genetic Variance Prediction and Cross-
		Validation // The main attribute of 'PopVar' is the prediction
		of genetic variance in bi-parental populations, from which the
		package derives its name. 'PopVar' contains a set of functions
		that use phenotypic and genotypic data from a set of candidate
		parents to 1) predict the mean, genetic variance, and superior
		progeny value of all, or a defined set of pairwise bi-parental
		crosses, and 2) perform cross-validation to estimate genome-
		wide prediction accuracy of multiple statistical models. More
		details are available in Mohammadi, Tiede, and Smith (2015).
		Crop Sci. doi:10.2135/cropsci2015.01.0030. A dataset
		'think_barley.rda' is included for reference and examples.
