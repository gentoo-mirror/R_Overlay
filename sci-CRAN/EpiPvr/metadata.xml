		Estimating Plant Pathogen Epidemiology Parameters from Laboratory
		Assays // Provides functions for estimating plant pathogen
		parameters from access period (AP) experiments. Separate
		functions are implemented for semi-persistently transmitted
		(SPT) and persistently transmitted (PT) pathogens. The common
		AP experiment exposes insect cohorts to infected source plants,
		healthy test plants, and intermediate plants (for PT
		pathogens). The package allows estimation of acquisition and
		inoculation rates during feeding, recovery rates, and latent
		progression rates (for PT pathogens). Additional functions
		support inference of epidemic risk from pathogen and local
		parameters, and also simulate AP experiment data. The functions
		implement probability models for epidemiological analysis, as
		derived in Donnelly et al. (2025), doi:10.32942/X29K9P. These
		models were originally implemented in the 'EpiPv' 'GitHub'
		package.
