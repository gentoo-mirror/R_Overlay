		Hierarchical Partitioning // Partitioning of the independent and
		joint contributions of each variable in a multivariate data
		set, to a linear regression by hierarchical decomposition of
		goodness-of-fit measures of regressions using all subsets of
		predictors in the data set. (i.e., model (1), (2), ..., (N),
		(1,2), ..., (1,N), ..., (1,2,3,...,N)). A Z-score based
		estimate of the 'importance' of each predictor is provided by
		using a randomisation test.
