		Fitting Separable Nonlinear Models in Spectroscopy and Microscopy
		// A problem solving environment (PSE) for fitting separable
		nonlinear models to measurements arising in physics and
		chemistry experiments, as described by Mullen  van Stokkum
		(2007) doi:10.18637/jss.v018.i03 for its use in fitting time
		resolved spectroscopy data, and as described by Laptenok et al.
		(2007) doi:10.18637/jss.v018.i08 for its use in fitting
		Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) data, in the
		study of Frster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).  `TIMP` also
		serves as the computation backend for the `GloTarAn` software,
		a graphical user interface for the package, as described in
		Snellenburg et al. (2012) doi:10.18637/jss.v049.i03.
