		Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation Growth Curve
		Analysis // Functions for fitting and plotting SITAR (Super
		Imposition by Translation And Rotation) growth curve models.
		SITAR is a shape-invariant model with a regression B-spline
		mean curve and subject-specific random effects on both the
		measurement and age scales. The model was first described by
		Lindstrom (1995) doi:10.1002/sim.4780141807 and developed as
		the SITAR method by Cole et al (2010) doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115.
