		Multiple Choice Test Evaluation // A set of functions designed to
		quickly generate results of a multiple choice test. Generates
		detailed global results, lists for anonymous feedback and
		personalised result feedback (in LaTeX and/or PDF format), as
		well as item statistics like Cronbach's alpha or disciminatory
		power. 'klausuR' also includes a plugin for the R GUI and IDE
		RKWard, providing graphical dialogs for its basic features. The
		respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from
		a repository, as it is a part of RKWard. To make full use of
		this feature, please install RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org
		(plugins are detected automatically). Due to some restrictions
		on CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the
		project homepage.
