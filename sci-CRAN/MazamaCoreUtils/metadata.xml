		Utility Functions for Production R Code // A suite of utility
		functions providing functionality commonly needed for
		production level projects such as logging, error handling,
		cache management and date-time parsing. Functions for date-time
		parsing and formatting require that time zones be specified
		explicitly, avoiding a common source of error when working with
		environmental time series.
