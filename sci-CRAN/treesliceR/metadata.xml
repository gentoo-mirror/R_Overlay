		To Slice Phylogenetic Trees and Infer Evolutionary Patterns Over
		Time // Provide a range of functions with multiple criteria for
		cutting phylogenetic trees at any evolutionary depth. It
		enables users to cut trees in any orientation, such as
		rootwardly (from root to tips) and tipwardly (from tips to its
		root), or allows users to define a specific time interval of
		interest. It can also be used to create multiple tree pieces of
		equal temporal width. Moreover, it allows the assessment of
		novel temporal rates for various phylogenetic indexes, which
		can be quickly displayed graphically.
