		Retrieving Acceptance Sampling Schemes // Functions are included
		for recalling AQL (Acceptable Quality Level or Acceptance
		Quality Level) Based single, double, and multiple attribute
		sampling plans from the Military Standard (MIL-STD-105E) -
		American National Standards Institute/American Society for
		Quality (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4) tables and for retrieving variable
		sampling plans from Military Standard (MIL-STD-414) - American
		National Standards Institute/American Society for Quality
		(ANSI/ASQ Z1.9) tables. The sources for these tables are listed
		in the URL: field. Also included are functions for computing
		the OC (Operating Characteristic) and ASN (Average Sample
		Number) coordinates for the attribute plans it recalls, and
		functions for computing the estimated proportion nonconforming
		and the maximum allowable proportion nonconforming for variable
		sampling plans. The MIL-STD AQL Sampling schemes were the most
		used and copied set of standards in the world. They are
		intended to be used for sampling a stream of lots, and were
		used in contract agreements between supplier and customer
		companies. When the US military dropped support of MIL-STD 105E
		and 414, The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and
		the International Standards Organization (ISO) adopted the
		standard with few changes or no changes to the central tables.
		This package is useful because its computer implementation of
		these tables duplicates that available in other commercial
		software and subscription online calculators.
