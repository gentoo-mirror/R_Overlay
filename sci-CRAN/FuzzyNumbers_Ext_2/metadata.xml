		Apply Two Fuzzy Numbers on a Monotone Function // One can easily
		draw the membership function of f(x,y) by package
		'FuzzyNumbers.Ext.2' in which f(.,.) is supposed monotone and x
		and y are two fuzzy numbers. This work is possible using
		function f2apply() which is an extension of function fapply()
		from Package 'FuzzyNumbers' for two-variable monotone
		functions. Moreover, this package has the ability of computing
		the core, support and alpha-cuts of the fuzzy-valued final
		result.
