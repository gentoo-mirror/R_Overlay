		Data Quality Reporting for Temporal Datasets // Generate reports
		that enable quick visual review of temporal shifts in record-
		level data. Time series plots showing aggregated values are
		automatically created for each data field (column) depending on
		its contents (e.g. min/max/mean values for numeric data, no. of
		distinct values for categorical data), as well as overviews for
		missing values, non-conformant values, and duplicated rows. The
		resulting reports are shareable and can contribute to forming a
		transparent record of the entire analysis process. It is
		designed with Electronic Health Records in mind, but can be
		used for any type of record-level temporal data (i.e. tabular
		data where each row represents a single "event", one column
		contains the "event date", and other columns contain any
		associated values for the event).
