		Functions to Score Commonly-Used Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO)
		Measures and Other Psychometric Instruments // An extensible
		repository of accurate, up-to-date functions to score commonly
		used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life (QOL), and
		other psychometric and psychological measures.  'PROscorer',
		together with the 'PROscorerTools' package, is a system to
		facilitate the incorporation of PRO measures into research
		studies and clinical settings in a scientifically rigorous and
		reproducible manner.  These packages and their vignettes are
		intended to help establish and promote "best practices" to
		improve the planning, scoring, and reporting of PRO-like
		measures in research. The 'PROscorer' "Instrument Descriptions"
		vignette contains descriptions of each instrument scored by
		'PROscorer', complete with references.  These instrument
		descriptions are suitable for inclusion in formal study
		protocol documents, grant proposals, and manuscript Method
		sections.  Each 'PROscorer' function is composed of helper
		functions from the 'PROscorerTools' package, and users are
		encouraged to contribute new functions to 'PROscorer'.  More
		scoring functions are currently in development and will be
		added in future updates.
