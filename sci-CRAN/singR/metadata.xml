		Simultaneous Non-Gaussian Component Analysis // Implementation of
		SING algorithm to extract joint and individual non-Gaussian
		components from two datasets. SING uses an objective function
		that maximizes the skewness and kurtosis of latent components
		with a penalty to enhance the similarity between subject
		scores. Unlike other existing methods, SING does not use PCA
		for dimension reduction, but rather uses non-Gaussianity, which
		can improve feature extraction. Benjamin B.Risk, Irina
		Gaynanova (2021) doi:10.1214/21-AOAS1466.
