		Bland-Altman Method Comparison // Carries out Bland Altman
		analyses (also known as a Tukey mean-difference plot) as
		described by JM Bland and DG Altman in 1986
		doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(86)90837-8. This package was created in
		2015 as existing Bland-Altman analysis functions did not
		calculate confidence intervals. This package was created to
		rectify this, and create reproducible plots.
