		Enhanced RTF Wrapper for Use with Existing Table Packages //
		Enhanced RTF wrapper written in R for use with existing R
		tables packages such as 'Huxtable' or 'GT'. This package fills
		a gap where tables in certain packages can be written out to
		RTF, but cannot add certain metadata or features to the
		document that are required/expected in a report for a
		regulatory submission, such as multiple levels of titles and
		footnotes, making the document landscape, and controlling
		properties such as margins.
