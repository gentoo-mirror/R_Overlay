		Estimation of R0 and Real-Time Reproduction Number from Epidemics
		// Estimation of reproduction numbers for disease outbreak,
		based on incidence data. The R0 package implements several
		documented methods. It is therefore possible to compare
		estimations according to the methods used. Depending on the
		methods requested by user, basic reproduction number (commonly
		denoted as R0) or real-time reproduction number (referred to as
		R(t)) is computed, along with a 95% Confidence Interval.
		Plotting outputs will give different graphs depending on the
		methods requested : basic reproductive number estimations will
		only show the epidemic curve (collected data) and an adjusted
		model, whereas real-time methods will also show the R(t)
		variations throughout the outbreak time period. Sensitivity
		analysis tools are also provided, and allow for investigating
		effects of varying Generation Time distribution or time window
		on estimates.
