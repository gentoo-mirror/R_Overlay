		Spatial Network Autocorrelation for Flow Data // Identify
		statistically significant flow clusters using the local spatial
		network autocorrelation statistic G_ij* proposed by 'Berglund'
		and 'Karlstrm' (1999) doi:10.1007/s101090050013. The metric, an
		extended statistic of 'Getis/Ord' G ('Getis' and 'Ord' 1992)
		doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x, detects a group of
		flows having similar traits in terms of directionality. You
		provide OD data and the associated polygon to get results with
		several parameters, some of which are defined by spdep package.
