		Partitioning Hierarchical Diversity and Differentiation Across
		Metrics and Scales, from Genes to Ecosystems // Miscellaneous R
		functions for calculating and decomposing multiple hierarchical
		diversity metrics, including hierarchical allele richness
		(q=1), hierarchical exponential Shannon entropy (q=1),
		hierarchical heterozygosity (q=2) and genetic differentiation
		(Fst and Delta D). This package allows you to analyse spatial
		structured genetic data or species data under a unifying
		framework (Gaggiotti, O. E. et al, 2018, Evol Appl,
		11:1176-1193; DOI:10.1111/eva.12593), which partitions
		diversity and differentiation into any hierarchical levels. It
		helps you easily structure and format your data. It produces
		diversity profiles (q=0,1,2), hierarchical diversities and
		differentiation, as well as the the correlation between
		geographic distance and genetic differentiation.
