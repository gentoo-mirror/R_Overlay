		Partitioning Hierarchical Diversity and Differentiation Across
		Metrics and Scales, from Genes to Ecosystems // Miscellaneous R
		functions for calculating and decomposing hierarchical
		diversity metrics, including hierarchical allele richness,
		hierarchical exponential Shannon entropy (true diversity of
		order q=1), hierarchical heterozygosity and genetic
		differentiation (Jaccard dissimilarity, Delta D,Fst and Jost's
		D). In addition,a new approach to identify population structure
		based on the homogeneity of multivariate variances of Shannon
		differentiation is presented. This package allows you to
		analyse spatial structured genetic data or species data under a
		unifying framework (Gaggiotti, O. E. et al, 2018, Evol Appl,
		11:1176-1193; DOI:10.1111/eva.12593), which partitions
		diversity and differentiation into any hierarchical levels. It
		helps you easily structure and format your data. In summary,it
		implements the analyses of true diversity profiles (q=0,1,2),
		hierarchical diversities and differentiation decomposition,
		visualization of population structure, as well as the
		estimation of correlation between geographic distance and
		genetic differentiation.
