		Extension to 'ggplot2' // The R package 'ggplot2' is a plotting
		system based on the grammar of graphics.  'GGally' extends
		'ggplot2' by adding several functions to reduce the complexity
		of combining geometric objects with transformed data.  Some of
		these functions include a pairwise plot matrix, a two group
		pairwise plot matrix, a parallel coordinates plot, a survival
		plot, and several functions to plot networks.
