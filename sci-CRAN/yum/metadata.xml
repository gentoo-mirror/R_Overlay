		Utilities to Extract and Process 'YAML' Fragments // Provides a
		number of functions to facilitate extracting information in
		'YAML' fragments from one or multiple files, optionally
		structuring the information in a 'data.tree'. 'YAML' (recursive
		acronym for "YAML ain't Markup Language") is a convention for
		specifying structured data in a format that is both machine-
		and human-readable. 'YAML' therefore lends itself well for
		embedding (meta)data in plain text files, such as Markdown
		files. This principle is implemented in 'yum' with minimal
		dependencies (i.e. only the 'yaml' packages, and the
		'data.tree' package can be used to enable additional
		functionality).
