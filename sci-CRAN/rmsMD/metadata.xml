		Output Results from 'rms' Models for Medical Journals // Provides
		streamlined functions for summarising and visualising
		regression models fitted with the 'rms' package, in the
		preferred format for medical journals. The 'modelsummary_rms()'
		function produces concise summaries for linear, logistic, and
		Cox regression models, including automatic handling of models
		containing restricted cubic spline (RCS) terms. The resulting
		summary dataframe can be easily converted into publication-
		ready documents using the 'flextable' and 'officer' packages.
		The 'ggrmsMD()' function creates clear and customizable plots
		('ggplot2' objects) to visualise RCS terms.
