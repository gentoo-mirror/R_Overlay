		Output Results from 'rms' Models for Medical Journals // This
		takes the output of models performed using the 'rms' package
		and returns a dataframe with the results. This output is in the
		format required by medical journals. For example for cox
		regression models, the hazard ratios, their 95% confidence
		intervals, and p values will be provided. There are additional
		functions for outputs when the model included restricted cubic
		spline (RCS) terms. Models using imputed data (eg from
		aregimpute()) and fitted used fit.mult.impute() can also be
		processed. The dataframe which is returned can easily be turned
		into a publication ready table with packages 'flextable' and
		'officer'.
