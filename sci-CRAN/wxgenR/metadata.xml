		A Stochastic Weather Generator with Seasonality // A weather
		generator to simulate precipitation and temperature for regions
		with seasonality. Users input training data containing
		precipitation, temperature, and seasonality (up to 26 seasons).
		Including weather season as a training variable allows users to
		explore the effects of potential changes in season duration as
		well as average start- and end-time dates due to phenomena like
		climate change. Data for training should be a single time
		series but can originate from station data, basin averages,
		grid cells, etc. Bearup, L., Gangopadhyay, S.,  Mikkelson, K.
