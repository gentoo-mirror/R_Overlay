		Likelihood Based Optimal Partitioning and Indicator Species
		Analysis // Likelihood based optimal partitioning and indicator
		species analysis. Finding the best binary partition for each
		species based on model selection, with the possibility to take
		into account modifying/confounding variables as described in
		Kemencei et al. (2014) doi:10.1556/ComEc.15.2014.2.6. The
		package implements binary and multi-level response models,
		various measures of uncertainty, Lorenz-curve based
		thresholding, with native support for parallel computations.
