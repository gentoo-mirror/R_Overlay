		Stratified and Personalised Models Based on Model-Based Trees and
		Forests // Model-based trees for subgroup analyses in clinical
		trials and model-based forests for the estimation and
		prediction of personalised treatment effects (personalised
		models). Currently partitioning of linear models, lm(),
		generalised linear models, glm(), and Weibull models,
		survreg(), is supported.  Advanced plotting functionality is
		supported for the trees and a test for parameter heterogeneity
		is provided for the personalised models. For details on model-
		based trees for subgroup analyses see Seibold, Zeileis and
		Hothorn (2016) doi:10.1515/ijb-2015-0032; for details on model-
		based forests for estimation of individual treatment effects
		see Seibold, Zeileis and Hothorn (2017)
