		Estimation of Count Data Models // The maximum likelihood
		estimation (MLE) of the count data models along with standard
		error of the estimates and Akaike information model section
		criterion are provided. The functions allow to compute the MLE
		for the following distributions such as the Bell distribution,
		the Borel distribution, the Poisson distribution, zero inflated
		Bell distribution, zero inflated Bell Touchard distribution,
		zero inflated Poisson distribution, zero one inflated Bell
		distribution and zero one inflated Poisson distribution.
		Moreover, the probability mass function (PMF), distribution
		function (CDF), quantile function (QF) and random numbers
		generation of the Bell Touchard and zero inflated Bell Touchard
		distribution are also provided.
