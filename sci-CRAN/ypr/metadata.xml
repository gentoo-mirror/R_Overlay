		Yield Per Recruit // An implementation of equilibrium-based yield
		per recruit methods. Yield per recruit methods can used to
		estimate the optimal yield for a fish population. The yield can
		be based on the number of fish caught (or harvested) or biomass
		caught for all fish or just large (trophy) individuals.
