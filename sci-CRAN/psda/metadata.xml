		Polygonal Symbolic Data Analysis // A toolbox in symbolic data
		framework as a statistical learning and data mining solution
		for symbolic polygonal data analysis. This study is a new
		approach in data analysis and it was proposed by Silva et al.
		(2019) doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2018.08.009. The package presents
		the estimation of main descriptive statistical measures, e.g,
		mean, covariance, variance, correlation and coefficient of
		variation. In addition, a method to obtain polygonal data from
		classical data is presented. Empirical probability distribution
		function based on symbolic polygonal histogram and a regression
		model with its main measures are presented.
