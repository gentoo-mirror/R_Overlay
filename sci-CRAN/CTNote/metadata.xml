		CTN Outcomes, Treatments, and Endpoints // The Clinical Trials
		Network (CTN) of the U.S. National Institute of Drug Abuse
		sponsored the CTN-0094 research team to harmonize data sets
		from three nationally-representative clinical trials for opioid
		use disorder (OUD). The CTN-0094 team herein provides a coded
		collection of trial outcomes and endpoints used in various OUD
		clinical trials over the past 50 years. These coded outcome
		functions are used to contrast and cluster different clinical
		outcome functions based on daily or weekly patient urine
		screenings. Note that we abbreviate urine drug screen as "UDS"
		and urine opioid screen as "UOS". For the example data sets
		(based on clinical trials data harmonized by the CTN-0094
		research team), UDS and UOS are largely interchangeable.
