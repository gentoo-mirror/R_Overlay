		Comparing Multiple Survival Functions via Empirical Likelihood
		(EL) Based Tests // Contains routines for computing the one-
		sided/two-sided integrated/maximally selected EL statistics for
		simultaneous testing, the one-sided/two-sided EL tests for
		pointwise testing, and an initial test that precedes one-sided
		testing to exclude the possibility of crossings or alternative
		orderings.
