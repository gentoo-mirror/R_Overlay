		Reporting Tables // Reporting tables often have structure that
		goes beyond simple rectangular data. The 'rtables' package
		provides a framework for declaring complex multi-level
		tabulations and then applying them to data. This framework
		models both tabulation and the resulting tables as
		hierarchical, tree-like objects which support sibling sub-
		tables, arbitrary splitting or grouping of data in row and
		column dimensions, cells containing multiple values, and the
		concept of contextual summary computations. A convenient pipe-
		able interface is provided for declaring table layouts and the
		corresponding computations, and then applying them to data.
