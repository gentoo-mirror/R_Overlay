		Choice Models with Economic Foundation // Implements choice
		models based on economic theory, including estimation using
		Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), prediction, and more. Its
		usability is inspired by ideas from 'tidyverse'. Models include
		versions of the Hierarchical Multinomial Logit and Multiple
		Discrete-Continous (Volumetric) models with and without
		screening. The foundations of these models are described in
		Allenby, Hardt and Rossi (2019)
		doi:10.1016/bs.hem.2019.04.002. Models with conjunctive
		screening are described in Kim, Hardt, Kim and Allenby (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.04.001. Models with set-size
		variation are described in Hardt and Kurz (2020)
