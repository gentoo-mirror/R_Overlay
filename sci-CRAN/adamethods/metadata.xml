		Archetypoid Algorithms and Anomaly Detection // Collection of
		several algorithms to obtain archetypoids with small and large
		databases, and with both classical multivariate data and
		functional data (univariate and multivariate). Some of these
		algorithms also allow to detect anomalies (outliers). Please
		see Vinue and Epifanio (2020) doi:10.1007/s11634-020-00412-9.
