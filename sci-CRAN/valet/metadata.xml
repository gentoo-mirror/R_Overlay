		Provide R Client to the Bank of Canada's Valet API // The Bank of
		Canada updated their Valet API
		https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/docs, and no R client
		currently exists. This provides access to all of Valet's
		endpoints and serves responses in wide format easy for
		researchers to handle but also provides tools to access API
		responses as a list.
