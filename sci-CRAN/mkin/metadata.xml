		Kinetic Evaluation of Chemical Degradation Data // Calculation
		routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006, 2014).
		Includes a function for conveniently defining differential
		equation models, model solution based on eigenvalues if
		possible or using numerical solvers.  If a C compiler (on
		windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential equation models
		are solved using automatically generated C functions.
		Heteroscedasticity can be taken into account using variance by
		variable or two-component error models as described by Ranke
		and Meinecke (2018) doi:10.3390/environments6120124.
		Hierarchical degradation models can be fitted using nonlinear
		mixed-effects model packages as a back end as described by
		Ranke et al. (2021) doi:10.3390/environments8080071.  Please
		note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or
		fitness for a particular purpose.
