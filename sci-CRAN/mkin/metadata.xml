		Kinetic Evaluation of Chemical Degradation Data // Calculation
		routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006, 2014).
		Includes a function for conveniently defining differential
		equation models, model solution based on eigenvalues if
		possible or using numerical solvers.  If a C compiler (on
		windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential equation models
		are solved using automatically generated C functions.  Please
		note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or
		fitness for a particular purpose.
