		Pseudo-Realizations for Gaussian Process Excursions // Computes
		pseudo-realizations from the posterior distribution of a
		Gaussian Process (GP) with the method described in Azzimonti et
		al. (2016) doi:10.1137/141000749. The realizations are obtained
		from simulations of the field at few well chosen points that
		minimize the expected distance in measure between the true
		excursion set of the field and the approximate one. Also
		implements a R interface for (the main function of) Distance
		Transform of sampled Functions
		(http://cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/dt/index.html).
