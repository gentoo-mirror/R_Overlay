		Applications of Empirical Dynamic Modeling from Time Series // A
		new implementation of EDM algorithms based on research software
		previously developed for internal use in the Sugihara Lab
		(UCSD/SIO). Contains C++ compiled objects that use time delay
		embedding to perform state-space reconstruction and nonlinear
		forecasting and an R interface to those objects using 'Rcpp'.
		It supports both the simplex projection method from Sugihara
		May (1990) DOI:10.1038/344734a0 and the S-map algorithm in
		Sugihara (1994) DOI:10.1098/rsta.1994.0106. In addition, this
		package implements convergent cross mapping as described in
		Sugihara et al. (2012) DOI:10.1126/science.1227079 and
		multiview embedding as described in Ye  Sugihara (2016)
		DOI:10.1126/science.aag0863.
