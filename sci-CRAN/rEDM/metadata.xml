		Applications of Empirical Dynamic Modeling from Time Series // A
		new implementation of EDM algorithms and is based on research
		software previously developed for internal use in the Sugihara
		Lab (UCSD/SIO). Contains C++ compiled objects that use time
		delay embedding to perform state-space reconstruction and
		nonlinear forecasting and an R interface to those objects using
		'Rcpp'. It supports both the simplex projection method from
		Sugihara  May (1990) DOI:10.1038/344734a0 and the S-map
		algorithm in Sugihara (1994) DOI:10.1098/rsta.1994.0106. In
		addition, this package implements convergent cross mapping as
		described in Sugihara et al. (2012) DOI:10.1126/science.1227079
		and multiview embedding as described in Ye  Sugihara (2016)
		DOI:10.1126/science.aag0863.
