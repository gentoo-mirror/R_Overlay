		Ranking Nodes in Bipartite and Weighted Networks // Highly
		efficient functions for estimating various rank (centrality)
		measures of nodes in bipartite graphs (two-mode networks).
		Includes methods for estimating HITS, CoHITS, BGRM, and BiRank
		with implementation primarily inspired by He et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2611584. Also provides easy-to-use tools
		for efficiently estimating PageRank in one-mode graphs,
		incorporating or removing edge-weights during rank estimation,
		projecting two-mode graphs to one-mode, and for converting
		edgelists and matrices to sparseMatrix format. Best of all, the
		package's rank estimators can work directly with common formats
		of network data including edgelists (class data.frame,
		data.table, or tbl_df) and adjacency matrices (class matrix or
		dgCMatrix).
