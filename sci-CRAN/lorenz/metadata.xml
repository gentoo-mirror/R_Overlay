		Tools for Deriving Income Inequality Estimates from Grouped
		Income Data // Provides two methods of estimating income
		inequality statistics from binned income data, such as the
		income data provided in the Census. These methods use different
		interpolation techniques to infer the distribution of incomes
		within income bins.  One method is an implementation of
		Jargowsky and Wheeler's mean-constrained integration over
		brackets (MCIB).  The other method is based on a new technique,
		Lorenz interpolation, which estimates income inequality by
		constructing an interpolated Lorenz curve based on the binned
		income data.  These methods can be used to estimate three
		income inequality measures: the Gini (the default measure
		returned), the Theil, and the Atkinson's index. Jargowsky and
		Wheeler (2018) doi:10.1177/0081175018782579.
