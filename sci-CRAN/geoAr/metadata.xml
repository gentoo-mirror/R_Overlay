		Argentina's Spatial Data Toolbox // Collection of tools that
		facilitates data access and workflow for spatial analysis of
		Argentina. Includes historical information from censuses,
		administrative limits at different levels of aggregation,
		location of human settlements, among others. Since it is
		expected that the majority of users will be Spanish-speaking,
		the documentation of the package prioritizes this language,
		although an effort is made to also offer annotations in
		English.
