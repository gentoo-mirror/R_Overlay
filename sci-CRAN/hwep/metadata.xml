		Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium in Polyploids // Inference concerning
		equilibrium and random mating in autopolyploids. Methods are
		available to test for equilibrium and random mating at any even
		ploidy level (2) in the presence of double reduction at
		biallelic loci. For autopolyploid populations in equilibrium,
		methods are available to estimate the degree of double
		reduction. We also provide functions to calculate genotype
		frequencies at equilibrium, or after one or several rounds of
		random mating, given rates of double reduction. The main
		function is hwefit(). This material is based upon work
		supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.
		2132247. The opinions, findings, and conclusions or
		recommendations expressed are those of the author and do not
		necessarily reflect the views of the National Science
		Foundation. For details of these methods, see Gerard (2022a)
