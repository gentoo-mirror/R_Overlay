		Generalised Linear Mixed Models in R // Specification of
		generalised linear mixed models with a range of related
		functions and calculations. The package provides classes
		'Covariance', 'MeanFunction' and 'Model', which allow for
		flexible specification of generalised linear mixed models, as
		well as functionality to produce relevant matrices, values, and
		analyses. See https://github.com/samuel-
		watson/glmmrBase/blob/master/README.md for a detailed manual.
