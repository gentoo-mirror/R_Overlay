		Generalised Linear Mixed Models in R // Specification, analysis,
		simulation, and fitting of generalised linear mixed models.
		Includes Markov Chain Monte Carlo Maximum likelihood and
		Laplace approximation model fitting for a range of models, non-
		linear fixed effect specifications, a wide range of flexible
		covariance functions that can be combined arbitrarily, robust
		and bias-corrected standard error estimation, power
		calculation, data simulation, and more. See https://samuel-
		watson.github.io/glmmr-web/ for a detailed manual.
