		Support Points // Provides the function sp() for generating the
		support points proposed in Mak and Joseph (2017)
		arXiv:1609.01811. Support points are representative points of a
		possibly non-uniform distribution, and can be used as optimal
		sampling or integration points for a distribution of choice.
		The provided function sp() can be used to generate support
		points for standard distributions or for reducing big data
		(e.g., from Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods). This work was
		supported by USARO grant W911NF-14-1-0024 and NSF DMS grant
		1712642.
