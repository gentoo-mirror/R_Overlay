		Support Points // The 'support' package provides the functions
		sp() and sp_seq() for computing the support points in Mak and
		Joseph (2018) DOI:10.1214/17-AOS1629. Support points can be
		used as a representative sample of a desired distribution, or a
		representative reduction of a big dataset (e.g., an "optimal"
		thinning of Markov-chain Monte Carlo sample chains). This work
		was supported by USARO grant W911NF-14-1-0024 and NSF DMS grant
		1712642.
