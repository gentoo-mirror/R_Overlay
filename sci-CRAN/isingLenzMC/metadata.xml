		Monte Carlo for Classical Ising Model // Classical Ising Model is
		a land mark system in statistical physics.The model explains
		the physics of spin glasses and magnetic materials, and
		cooperative phenomenon in general, for example phase
		transitions and neural networks.This package provides utilities
		to simulate one dimensional Ising Model with Metropolis and
		Glauber Monte Carlo with single flip dynamics in periodic
		boundary conditions. Utility functions for exact solutions are
		provided. Such as transfer matrix for 1D. Utility functions for
		exact solutions are provided. Example use cases are as follows:
		Measuring effective ergodicity and power-laws in so called
		functional-diffusion.
