		Copula Based Cox Proportional Hazards Models for Dependent
		Censoring // Copula based Cox proportional hazards models for
		survival data subject to dependent censoring. This approach
		does not assume that the parameter defining the copula is
		known. The dependency parameter is estimated with other finite
		model parameters by maximizing a Pseudo likelihood function.
		The cumulative hazard function is estimated via estimating
		equations derived based on martingale ideas. Available copula
		functions include Frank, Gumbel and Normal copulas. Only
		Weibull and lognormal models are allowed for the censoring
		model, even though any parametric model that satisfies certain
		identifiability conditions could be used. Implemented methods
		are described in the article "Copula based Cox proportional
		hazards models for dependent censoring" by Deresa and Van
		Keilegom (2024) doi:10.1080/01621459.2022.2161387.
