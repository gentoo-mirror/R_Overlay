		Analyzing the Lying Behavior of Cows from Accelerometer Data //
		Assists in analyzing the lying behavior of cows from raw data
		recorded with a triaxial accelerometer attached to the hind leg
		of a cow. Allows the determination of common measures for lying
		behavior including total lying duration, the number of lying
		bouts, and the mean duration of lying bouts. Further
		capabilities are the description of lying laterality and the
		calculation of proxies for the level of physical activity of
		the cow. Reference: Simmler M., Brouwers S. P. (2024)
