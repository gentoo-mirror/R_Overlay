		Covariate-Adaptive Randomization for Clinical Trials // Provides
		functions and command-line user interface to generate
		allocation sequence by covariate-adaptive randomization for
		clinical trials. The package currently supports six covariate-
		adaptive randomization procedures. Three hypothesis testing
		methods that are valid and robust under covariate-adaptive
		randomization are also available in the package to facilitate
		the inference for treatment effect under the included
		randomization procedures. Additionally, the package provides
		comprehensive and efficient tools to allow one to evaluate and
		compare the performance of randomization procedures and tests
		based on various criteria. See Ma W, Ye X, Tu F, and Hu F
		(2023) doi: 10.18637/jss.v107.i02 for details.
