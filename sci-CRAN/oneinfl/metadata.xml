		Estimates OIPP and OIZTNB Regression Models // Estimates one-
		inflated positive Poisson (OIPP) and one-inflated zero-
		truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB) regression models. A suite
		of ancillary statistical tools are also provided, including:
		estimation of positive Poisson (PP) and zero-truncated negative
		binomial (ZTNB) models; marginal effects and their standard
		errors; diagnostic likelihood ratio and Wald tests; plotting;
		predicted counts and expected responses; and random variate
		generation. The models and tools, as well as four applications,
		are shown in Godwin, R. T. (2024). "One-inflated zero-truncated
		count regression models" arXiv preprint
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2402.02272.
