		Fast Change Point Detection via Sequential Gradient Descent //
		Implements fast change point detection algorithm based on the
		paper "Sequential Gradient Descent and Quasi-Newton's Method
		for Change-Point Analysis" by Xianyang Zhang, Trisha Dawn
		https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/zhang23b.html. The algorithm
		is based on dynamic programming with pruning and sequential
		gradient descent. It is able to detect change points a
		magnitude faster than the vanilla Pruned Exact Linear
		Time(PELT). The package includes examples of linear regression,
		logistic regression, Poisson regression, penalized linear
		regression data, and whole lot more examples with custom cost
		function in case the user wants to use their own cost function.
