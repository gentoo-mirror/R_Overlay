		STG : Feature Selection using STochastic Gates // 'STG' is a
		method for feature selection in neural network. The procedure
		is based on probabilistic relaxation of the l0 norm of
		features, or the count of the number of selected features. The
		framework simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression
		or classification function while selecting a small subset of
		features. Read more: Yamada et al. (2020)
