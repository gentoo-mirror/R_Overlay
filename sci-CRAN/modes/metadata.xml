		Find the Modes and Assess the Modality of Complex and Mixture
		Distributions, Especially with Big Datasets // Designed with a
		dual purpose of accurately estimating the mode (or modes) as
		well as characterizing the modality of data. The specific
		application area includes complex or mixture distributions
		particularly in a big data environment. The heterogeneous
		nature of (big) data may require deep introspective statistical
		and machine learning techniques, but these statistical tools
		often fail when applied without first understanding the data.
		In small datasets, this often isn't a big issue, but when
		dealing with large scale data analysis or big data thoroughly
		inspecting each dimension typically yields an O(n^n-1) problem.
		As such, dealing with big data require an alternative toolkit.
		This package not only identifies the mode or modes for various
		data types, it also provides a programmatic way of
		understanding the modality (i.e. unimodal, bimodal, etc.) of a
		dataset (whether it's big data or not). See
		http://www.sdeevi.com/modes_package for examples and
		discussion.
