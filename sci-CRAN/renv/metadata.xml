		Project Environments // A dependency management toolkit for R.
		Using 'renv', you can create and manage project-local R
		libraries, save the state of these libraries to a 'lockfile',
		and later restore your library as required. Together, these
		tools can help make your projects more isolated, portable, and
		reproducible.
