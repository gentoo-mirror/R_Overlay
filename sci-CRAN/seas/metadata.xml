		Seasonal Analysis and Graphics, Especially for Climatology //
		Capable of deriving seasonal statistics, such as "normals", and
		analysis of seasonal data, such as departures. This package
		also has graphics capabilities for representing seasonal data,
		including boxplots for seasonal parameters, and bars for summed
		normals. There are many specific functions related to
		climatology, including precipitation normals, temperature
		normals, cumulative precipitation departures and precipitation
		interarrivals. However, this package is designed to represent
		any time-varying parameter with a discernible seasonal signal,
		such as found in hydrology and ecology.
