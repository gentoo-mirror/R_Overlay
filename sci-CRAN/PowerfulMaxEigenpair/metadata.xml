		Powerful Algorithm for Maximal Eigenpair // An implementation for
		using powerful algorithm to compute the maximal eigenpair of
		Hermitizable tridiagonal matrices in R. It provides two
		algorithms to find the maximal and the next to maximal
		eigenpairs under the tridiagonal matrix. Besides, it also
		provides two auxiliary algorithms to generate tridiagonal
		matrix and solve the linear equation by Thomas algorithm.
		Several examples are included in the vignettes to illustrate
		the usage of the functions.
