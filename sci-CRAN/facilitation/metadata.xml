		A C++ Framework for Plant-Plant Interaction IBMs // A tool for
		simulating a variety of spatial individual-based models of
		plant-plant interactions. User-created models can include any
		number of species, each of which can be structured in any
		number of life-stages, where each life-stage has specific
		death, growth and reproduction rates, as well as specific
		interaction radius, dispersal radius, and interaction effects
		over each other species/life-stage. Life stages were modeled so
		as to be a stochastic, individual-based version of differential
		Matrix Population Models (Caswell 2001, ISBN:0-87893-096-5).
		Interactions can be positive (facilitation) or negative
		(competition) and can affect death rates, growth rates or
		reproduction rates. Interactions from multiple numbers are
		additive, so as to best approximate classic population dynamics
		models such as the logistic model and Lotka-Volterra model
		(Britton 2004, ISBN:9781852335366). All models work in
		continuous time, implemented as an optimized version of the
		Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie 1976
		doi:10.1016/0021-9991(76)90041-3) for independent exponential
		times, and continuous space.
