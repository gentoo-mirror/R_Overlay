		Bayesian Spatial Split Population Survival Model // Parametric
		spatial split-population (SP) survival models for clustered
		event processes. The models account for structural and spatial
		heterogeneity among at risk and immune populations, and
		incorporate time-varying covariates. This package currently
		implements Weibull, Exponential and Log-logistic forms for the
		duration component. It also includes functions for a series of
		diagnostic tests and plots to easily visualize convergence and
		spatial effects. Users can create their own spatial weights
		matrix based on their units and adjacencies of interest, making
		the use of these models flexible and broadly applicable to a
		variety of research areas. Joo et al. (2020)
		https://github.com/Nicolas-
		Schmidt/BayesSPsurv/blob/master/man/figures/SPcure.pdf describe
		the estimators included in this package.
