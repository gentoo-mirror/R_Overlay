		Robust Online Bayesian Monitoring // An implementation of
		Bayesian online changepoint detection (Adams and MacKay (2007)
		arXiv:0710.3742) with an option for probability based outlier
		detection and removal (Wendelberger et. al. (2021)
		arXiv:2112.12899). Building on the independent multivariate
		constant mean model implemented in the 'R' package 'ocp', this
		package models multivariate data as multivariate normal about a
		linear trend, defined by user input covariates, with an
		unstructured error covariance. Changepoints are identified
		based on a probability threshold for windows of points.
