		General Purpose G-Estimation for End of Study or Time-Varying
		Outcomes // Provides a series of general purpose tools to
		perform g-estimation using the methods described in Sjolander
		and Vansteelandt (2016) doi:10.1515/em-2015-0005 and Dukes and
		Vansteelandt doi:10.1093/aje/kwx347. The package allows for
		g-estimation in a wide variety of circumstances, including an
		end of study or time-varying outcome, and an exposure that is a
		binary, continuous, or a categorical variable with three or
		more categories. The package also supports g-estimation with
		time-varying causal effects and effect modification by a
		confounding variable.
