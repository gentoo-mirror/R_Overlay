		Interface with the 'Fitbit' API // Many 'Fitbit' users, and
		R-friendly 'Fitbit' users especially, have found themselves
		curious about their 'Fitbit' data. 'Fitbit' aggregates a large
		amount of personal data, much of which is interesting for
		personal research and to satisfy curiosity, and is even
		potentially useful in medical settings. The goal of 'fitbitr'
		is to make interfacing with the 'Fitbit' API as streamlined as
		possible, to make it simple for R users of all backgrounds and
		comfort levels to analyze their 'Fitbit' data and do whatever
		they want with it! Currently, 'fitbitr' includes methods for
		pulling data on activity, sleep, and heart rate, but this list
		is likely to grow in the future as the package gains more
		traction and more requests for new methods to be implemented
		come in.  You can find details on the 'Fitbit' API at
		https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/.
