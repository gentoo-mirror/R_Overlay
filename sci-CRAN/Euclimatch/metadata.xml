		Euclidean Climatch Algorithm // An interface for performing
		climate matching using the Euclidean "Climatch" algorithm.
		Functions provide a vector of climatch scores (0-10) for each
		location (i.e., grid cell) within the recipient region, the
		percent of climatch scores = a threshold value, and mean
		climatch score. Tools for parallelization and visualizations
		are also provided. Note that the floor function that rounds the
		climatch score down to the nearest integer has been removed in
		this implementation and the Climatch algorithm, also referred
		to as the Climate algorithm, is described in: Crombie, J.,
		Brown, L., Lizzio, J.,  Hood, G. (2008). Climatch user manual.
		The method for the percent score is described in: Howeth, J.G.,
		Gantz, C.A., Angermeier, P.L., Frimpong, E.A., Hoff, M.H.,
		Keller, R.P., Mandrak, N.E., Marchetti, M.P., Olden, J.D.,
		Romagosa, C.M., and Lodge, D.M. (2016). doi:10.1111/ddi.12391.
