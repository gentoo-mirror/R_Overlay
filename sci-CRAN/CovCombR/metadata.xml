		Combine Partial Covariance / Relationship Matrices // Combine
		partial covariance matrices using a Wishart-EM algorithm.
		Methods are described in the November 2019 article by Akdemir
		et al. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/857425v1. It can
		be used to combine partially overlapping covariance matrices
		from independent trials, partially overlapping multi-view
		relationship data from genomic experiments, partially
		overlapping Gaussian graphs described by their covariance
		structures. High dimensional covariance estimation, multi-view
		data integration. high dimensional covariance graph estimation.
