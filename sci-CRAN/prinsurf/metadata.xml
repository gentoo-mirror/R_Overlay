		Constructs Principal Surfaces // Construct a principal surface
		that are two-dimensional surfaces that pass through the middle
		of a p-dimensional data set. They minimise the distance from
		the data points, and provide a nonlinear summary of data. The
		surfaces are nonparametric and their shape is suggested by the
		data. The formation of a surface is found using an iterative
		procedure which starts with a linear summary, typically with a
		principal component plane. Each successive iteration is a local
		average of the p-dimensional points, where an average is based
		on a projection of a point onto the nonlinear surface of the
		previous iteration. For more information on principal surfaces,
		see Ganey, R. (2019, "https://open.uct.ac.za/items/4e655d7d-
		d10c-481b-9ccc-801903aebfc8").
