		Bioinformatics Analysis of T-Cell and B-Cell Immune Repertoires
		// A comprehensive framework for bioinformatics exploratory
		analysis of bulk and single-cell T-cell receptor and antibody
		repertoires. It provides seamless data loading, analysis and
		visualisation for AIRR (Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire)
		data, both bulk immunosequencing (RepSeq) and single-cell
		sequencing (scRNAseq). It implements most of the widely used
		AIRR analysis methods, such as: clonality analysis, estimation
		of repertoire similarities in distribution of clonotypes and
		gene segments, repertoire diversity analysis, annotation of
		clonotypes using external immune receptor databases and
		clonotype tracking in vaccination and cancer studies. A
		successor to our previously published 'tcR' immunoinformatics
		package (Nazarov 2015) doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0613-1.
