		Exact Test and Visualization of Multi-Set Intersections //
		Identification of sets of objects with shared features is a
		common operation in all disciplines. Analysis of intersections
		among multiple sets is fundamental for in-depth understanding
		of their complex relationships. This package implements a
		theoretical framework for efficient computation of statistical
		distributions of multi-set intersections based upon
		combinatorial theory, and provides multiple scalable techniques
		for visualizing the intersection statistics. The statistical
		algorithm behind this package was published in Wang et al.
