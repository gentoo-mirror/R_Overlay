		Statistical Learning for Individualized Treatment Regime //
		Maximin-projection learning (MPL, Shi, et al., 2018) is
		implemented for recommending a meaningful and reliable
		individualized treatment regime for future groups of patients
		based on the observed data from different populations with
		heterogeneity in individualized decision making. Q-learning and
		A-learning are implemented for estimating the groupwise
		contrast function that shares the same marginal treatment
		effects. The packages contains classical Q-learning and
		A-learning algorithms for a single stage study as a byproduct.
		More functions will be added at later versions.
