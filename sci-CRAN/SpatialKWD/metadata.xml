		Spatial KWD for Large Spatial Maps // Contains efficient
		implementations of Discrete Optimal Transport algorithms for
		the computation of Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances between
		pairs of large spatial maps (Bassetti, Gualandi, Veneroni
		(2020), doi:10.1137/19M1261195). All the algorithms are based
		on an ad-hoc implementation of the Network Simplex algorithm.
		The package has four main helper functions: compareOneToOne()
		(to compare two spatial maps), compareOneToMany() (to compare a
		reference map with a list of other maps), compareAll() (to
		compute a matrix of distances between a list of maps), and
		focusArea() (to compute the KWD distance within a focus area).
		In non-convex maps, the helper functions first build the
		convex-hull of the input bins and pad the weights with zeros.
