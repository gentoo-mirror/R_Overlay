		Tables and Graphs for Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM)
		// Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) are a popular
		choice for analyzing longitudinal continuous outcomes in
		randomized clinical trials and beyond; see for example Cnaan,
		Laird and Slasor (1997)
		doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19971030)16:20%3C2349::AID-
		SIM667%3E3.0.CO;2-E. This package provides an interface for
		fitting MMRM within the 'tern'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=tern framework by Zhu et al.
		(2023) and tabulate results easily using 'rtables'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=rtables by Becker et al.
		(2023). It builds on 'mmrm'
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=mmrm by Sabans Bov et al.
		(2023) for the actual MMRM computations.
