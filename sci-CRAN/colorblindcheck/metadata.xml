		Check Color Palettes for Problems with Color Vision Deficiency //
		Compare color palettes with simulations of color vision
		deficiencies - deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia. It
		includes calculation of distances between colors, and creating
		summaries of differences between a color palette and
		simulations of color vision deficiencies. This work was
		inspired by the blog post at
		https://www.datawrapper.de/blog/colorblind-check.
