		Enhanced Assignment Operator to Overwrite or Grow Objects // Use
		'..' on the right hand side of the ':=' operator as a shorthand
		for the left hand side, so that 'var := f(..) + ..' is
		equivalent to 'var - f(var) + var'. This permits the user to be
		explicit about growing an object or overwriting it using its
		previous value, avoids repeating a variable name, and saves
		keystrokes, time, visual space and cognitive load.
