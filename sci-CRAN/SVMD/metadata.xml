		Spearman Variational Mode Decomposition // In practice, it is
		difficult to determine the number of decomposition modes, K,
		for Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). To overcome this
		issue, this study offers Spearman Variational Mode
		Decomposition (SVMD), a method that uses the Spearman
		correlation coefficient to calculate the ideal mode number.
		Unlike the Pearson correlation coefficient, which only returns
		a perfect value when X and Y are linearly connected, the
		Spearman correlation can be calculated without knowing the
		probability distributions of X and Y. The Spearman correlation
		coefficient, also called Spearman's rank correlation
		coefficient, is a subset of a wider correlation coefficient. As
		VMD decomposes a signal, the Spearman correlation coefficient
		between the reconstructed and original sequences rises as the
		mode number K increases. Once the signal has been fully
		decomposed, subsequent increases in K cause the correlation to
		gradually level off. When the correlation reaches a specific
		level, VMD is said to have adequately decomposed the signal.
		Numerous experiments revealed that a threshold of 0.997
		produces the best denoising effect, so the threshold is set at
		0.997. This package has been developed using concept of Yang et
		al. (2021)doi:10.1016/j.aej.2021.01.055.
