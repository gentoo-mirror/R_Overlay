		Realistic Quantitative Structure Models // Real Twig is a method
		to correct branch overestimation in quantitative structure
		models. Overestimated cylinders are correctly tapered using
		measured twig diameters of corresponding tree species.
		Supported quantitative structure modeling software includes
		'TreeQSM', 'SimpleForest' and 'Treegraph'. Also included is a
		novel database of twig diameters and tools for fractal analysis
		of point clouds.
