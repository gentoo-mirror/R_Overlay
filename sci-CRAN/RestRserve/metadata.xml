		A Framework for Building HTTP API // Allows to easily create
		high-performance full featured HTTP APIs from R functions.
		Provides high-level classes such as 'Request', 'Response',
		'Application', 'Middleware' in order to streamline server side
		application development. Out of the box allows to serve
		requests using 'Rserve' package, but flexible enough to
		integrate with other HTTP servers such as 'httpuv'.
