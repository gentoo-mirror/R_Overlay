		Tools for the Analysis of Clustered Data in QCA // Clustered set-
		relational data in Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) can
		have a hierarchical structure, a panel structure or repeated
		cross sections. 'QCAcluster' allows QCA researchers to
		supplement the analysis of pooled the data with a disaggregated
		perspective focusing on selected partitions of the data. The
		pooled data can be partitioned along the dimensions of the
		clustered data (individual cross sections or time series) to
		perform partition-specific truth table minimizations. Empirical
		researchers can further calculate the weight that each
		partition has on the parameters of the pooled solution and the
		diversity of the cases under analysis within and across
		partitions (see https://ingorohlfing.github.io/QCAcluster/).
