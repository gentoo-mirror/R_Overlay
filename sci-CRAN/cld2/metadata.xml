		Google's Compact Language Detector 2 // Bindings to Google's C++
		library Compact Language Detector 2 (see
		https://github.com/cld2owners/cld2#readme for more
		information). Probabilistically detects over 80 languages in
		plain text or HTML. For mixed-language input it returns the top
		three detected languages and their approximate proportion of
		the total classified text bytes (e.g. 80% English and 20%
		French out of 1000 bytes). There is also a 'cld3' package on
		CRAN which uses a neural network model instead.
