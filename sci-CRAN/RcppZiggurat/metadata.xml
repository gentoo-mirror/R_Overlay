		'Rcpp' Integration of Different "Ziggurat" Normal RNG
		Implementations // The Ziggurat generator for normally
		distributed random numbers, originally proposed by Marsaglia
		and Tsang (2000, doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08) has been improved
		upon a few times starting with Leong et al (2005,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07). This package provides an
		aggregation in order to compare different implementations in
		order to provide a 'faster but good enough' alternative for use
		with R and C++ code. See the 'zigg' package for a lighter
		implementation for much easier use in other packages.
