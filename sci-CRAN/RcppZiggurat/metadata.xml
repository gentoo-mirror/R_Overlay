		'Rcpp' Integration of Different "Ziggurat" Normal RNG
		Implementations // The Ziggurat generator for normally
		distributed random numbers, originally proposed by Marsaglia
		and Tsang (JSS, 2000), has been improved upon a few times
		starting with Leong et al (JSS, 2005). This package provides an
		aggregation in order to compare different implementations. The
		goal is to provide an 'faster but good enough' alternative for
		use with R and C++ code.
