		Hyper-Ensemble Smote Undersampled Random Forests // Machine
		learning supervised method to learn rare genomic features in
		imbalanced genetic data sets. This method can be also applied
		to classify or rank examples characterized by a high imbalance
		between the minority and majority class. hyperSMURF adopts a
		hyper-ensemble (ensemble of ensembles) approach, undersampling
		of the majority class and oversampling of the minority class to
		learn highly imbalanced data. Both single-core and parallel
		multi-core version of hyperSMURF are implemented.
