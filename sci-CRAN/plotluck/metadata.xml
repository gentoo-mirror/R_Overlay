		'ggplot2' Version of "I'm Feeling Lucky!" // Examines the
		characteristics of a data frame and a formula to automatically
		choose the most suitable type of plot out of the following
		supported options: scatter, violin, box, bar, density, hexagon
		bin, spine plot, and heat map. The aim of the package is to let
		the user focus on what to plot, rather than on the "how" during
		exploratory data analysis. It also automates handling of
		observation weights, logarithmic axis scaling, reordering of
		factor levels, and overlaying smoothing curves and median
		lines. Plots are drawn using 'ggplot2'.
