		General Equilibrium Modeling // Some tools for developing general
		equilibrium models and some general equilibrium models. These
		models can be used for teaching economic theory and are built
		by the methods of new structural economics (see
		https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/ and LI Wu, 2019, ISBN:
		9787521804225, General Equilibrium and Structural Dynamics:
		Perspectives of New Structural Economics. Beijing: Economic
		Science Press). The model form and mathematical methods can be
		traced back to J. von Neumann (1945, A Model of General
		Economic Equilibrium. The Review of Economic Studies, 13. pp.
		1-9), J. G. Kemeny, O. Morgenstern and G. L. Thompson (1956, A
		Generalization of the von Neumann Model of an Expanding
		Economy, Econometrica, 24, pp. 115-135) et al. By the way, J.
		G. Kemeny is a co-inventor of the computer language BASIC.
