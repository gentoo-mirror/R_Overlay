		Preprocessing and Modeling Kinase Activity Profiles in PamChip
		Data // This package contains the functions that can be used to
		analyze the PamChip microarray data. The package is mainly
		useful in fitting semi-parametric mixed effects models while
		accommodating various types of mean structures and correlation
		structures present in Kinase activity profiling experiments.
		The package can be used to visualize, cleaning Pam Chip data.
		And also it can be used in model fitting, velocity estimating,
		and testing the estimated velocities between the groups. The
		PamGeneMixed package is built up as a software implementation
		for the paper titled The Use of Semi-parametric Mixed Models to
		Analyze PamChip Peptide Array Data: an Application to an
		Oncology Experiment which is published in Bioinformatics
		(2011).
