		Finite Mixture of Hidden Markov Model // Estimation of the latent
		states and partition by maximum likelihood. Model can be used
		for analyzing accelerometer data. In such a case, the latent
		states corresponds to activity levels and the partition permits
		to consider heterogeneity within the population. Emission laws
		are zero-inflated gamma distributions. Their parameters depends
		on the latent states but not on the partition, to compare the
		time spent by activity levels between classes. Model
		description is available in Du Roy de Chaumaray, M. and Marbac,
		M. and Navarro, F. (2019) arXiv:1906.01547.
