		Interact with 'Google Analytics' // Functions for querying the
		'Google Analytics' core reporting, real-time, multi-channel
		funnel and management APIs, as well as the 'Google Tag Manager'
		(GTM) API. Write methods are also provided for the management
		and GTM APIs so that you can change tag, property or view
		settings, for example. Define reporting queries using natural R
		expressions instead of being concerned as much about API
		technical intricacies like query syntax, character code
		escaping, and API limitations.
