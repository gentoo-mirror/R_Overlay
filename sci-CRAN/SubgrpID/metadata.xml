		Patient Subgroup Identification for Clinical Drug Development //
		Implementation of Sequential BATTing (bootstrapping and
		aggregating of thresholds from trees) for developing threshold-
		based multivariate (prognostic/predictive) biomarker
		signatures. Variable selection is automatically built-in. Final
		signatures are returned with interaction plots for predictive
		signatures. Cross-validation performance evaluation and testing
		dataset results are also output. Detail algorithms are
		described in Huang et al (2017) doi:10.1002/sim.7236.
