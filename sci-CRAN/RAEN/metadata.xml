		Random Approximate Elastic Net (RAEN) Variable Selection Method
		// The Proportional Subdistribution Hazard (PSH) model has been
		popular for estimating the effects of the covariates on the
		cause of interest in Competing Risks analysis. The fast
		accumulation of large scale datasets has posed a challenge to
		classical statistical methods. Current penalized variable
		selection methods show unsatisfactory performance in ultra-high
		dimensional data. We propose a novel method, the Random
		Approximate Elastic Net (RAEN), with a robust and generalized
		solution to the variable selection problem for the PSH model.
		Our method shows improved sensitivity for variable selection
		compared with current methods.
