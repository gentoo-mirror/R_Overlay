		Robust Bayesian Variable Selection for Gene-Environment
		Interactions // Gene-environment (GE) interactions have
		important implications to elucidate the etiology of complex
		diseases beyond the main genetic and environmental effects.
		Outliers and data contamination in disease phenotypes of GE
		studies have been commonly encountered, leading to the
		development of a broad spectrum of robust penalization methods.
		Nevertheless, within the Bayesian framework, the issue has not
		been taken care of in existing studies. We develop a robust
		Bayesian variable selection method for GE interaction studies.
		The proposed Bayesian method can effectively accommodate heavy-
		tailed errors and outliers in the response variable while
		conducting variable selection by accounting for structural
		sparsity. In particular, the spike-and-slab priors have been
		imposed on both individual and group levels to identify
		important main and interaction effects. An efficient Gibbs
		sampler has been developed to facilitate fast computation. The
		Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and
		alternative methods are efficiently implemented in C++.
