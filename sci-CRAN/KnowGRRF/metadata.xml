		Knowledge-Based Guided Regularized Random Forest // Random Forest
		(RF) and Regularized Random Forest can be used for feature
		selection. Moreover, by Guided Regularized Random Forest,
		statistical-based weights are used to guide the regularization
		of random forest and further used for feature selection. This
		package can integrate prior information from multiple domains
		(statistical based and knowledge domain) to guide the
		regularization of random forest and feature selection. For more
		details, see reference: Guan X., Liu L. (2018)
