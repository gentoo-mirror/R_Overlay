		Generate Tile Maps // Implements an algorithm for generating
		maps, known as tile maps, in which each region is represented
		by a single tile of the same shape and size. The algorithm was
		first proposed in "Generating Tile Maps" by Graham McNeill and
		Scott Hale (2017) doi:10.1111/cgf.13200. Functions allow users
		to generate, plot, and compare square or hexagon tile maps.
