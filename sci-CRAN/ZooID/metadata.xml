		Load, Segment and Classify Zooplankton Images // This tool
		provides functions to load, segment and classify zooplankton
		images. The image processing algorithms and the machine
		learning classifiers in this package are (will be, since these
		have not been added yet) direct ports of an early 'python'
		implementation that can be found at
		https://github.com/arickGrootveld/ZooID. The model weights and
		datasets (also not added yet) that are a part of this package
		can also be found at Arick Grootveld, Eva R. Kozak, Carmen
		Franco-Gordo (2023) doi:10.5281/zenodo.7979996.
