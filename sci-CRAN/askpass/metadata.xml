		Safe Password Entry for R, Git, and SSH // Cross-platform
		utilities for prompting the user for credentials or a
		passphrase, for example to authenticate with a server or read a
		protected key. Includes native programs for MacOS and Windows,
		hence no 'tcltk' is required. Password entry can be invoked in
		two different ways: directly from R via the askpass() function,
		or indirectly as password-entry back-end for 'ssh-agent' or
		'git-credential' via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS
		environment variables. Thereby the user can be prompted for
		credentials or a passphrase if needed when R calls out to git
		or ssh.
