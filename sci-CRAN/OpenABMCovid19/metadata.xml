		Agent-Based Model for Modelling the COVID-19 // OpenABM-Covid19
		is an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the spread
		of COVID-19 in a city and to analyse the effect of both passive
		and active intervention strategies. Interactions between
		individuals are modelled on networks representing households,
		work-places and random contacts. The infection is transmitted
		between these contacts and the progression of the disease in
		individuals is modelled. Instantaneous contract-tracing and
		quarantining of contacts is modelled allowing the evaluation of
		the design and configuration of digital contract-tracing mobile
		phone apps. Robert Hinch, William J M Probert, et al. (2020)
