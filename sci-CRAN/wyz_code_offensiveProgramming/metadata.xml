		Wizardry Code Offensive Programming // Allows to change R coding
		from defensive programming (i.e. many input parameter checks
		implementation required) to offensive programming (none/reduced
		number of parameter checks required). Provides code
		instrumentation to ease this change. Should reduce the code
		size as many controls and type checks have no more reason to
		exist. Should also speed up processing as many checks will be
		reduced to single check.
