		Wizardry Code Offensive Programming // Allows to turn standard R
		code into offensive programming code. Provides code
		instrumentation to ease this change and tools to assist and
		accelerate code production and tuning while using offensive
		programming code technics. Should improve code robustness and
		quality. Function calls can be easily verified on-demand or in
		batch mode to assess parameter types and length conformities.
		Should improve coders productivity as offensive programming
		reduces the code size due to reduced number of controls all
		along the call chain. Should speed up processing as many checks
		will be reduced to one single check.
