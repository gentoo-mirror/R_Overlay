		Customer Intelligence Tool for Rapid Understandable Segmentation
		// A tool to easily run and visualise supervised and
		unsupervised state of the art customer segmentation. It is
		built like a pipeline covering the 3 main steps in a
		segmentation project: pre-processing, modelling, and plotting.
		Users can either run the pipeline as a whole, or choose to run
		any one of the three individual steps. It is equipped with a
		supervised option (tree optimisation) and an unsupervised
		option (k-clustering) as default models.
