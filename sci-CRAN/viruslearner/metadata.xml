		Ensemble Learning for HIV-Related Metrics // Advanced statistical
		modeling techniques for ensemble learning, specifically
		tailored to the analysis of lymphocyte counts and viral load
		data in the context of HIV research. Empowering researchers and
		practitioners, this tool provides a comprehensive solution for
		tasks such as analysis, prediction and risk calculation related
		to key viral metrics. The package incorporates cutting-edge
		ensemble learning principles, inspired by model stacking
		techniques of Simon P. Couch and Max Kuhn (2022)
		doi:10.21105/joss.04471 and adhering to tidy data principles,
		offering a robust and reproducible framework for HIV research.
