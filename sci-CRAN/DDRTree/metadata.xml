		Learning Principal Graphs with DDRTree // Provides an
		implementation of the framework of reversed graph embedding
		(RGE) which projects data into a reduced dimensional space
		while constructs a principal tree which passes through the
		middle of the data simultaneously. DDRTree shows superiority to
		alternatives (Wishbone, DPT) for inferring the ordering as well
		as the intrinsic structure of the single cell genomics data. In
		general, it could be used to reconstruct the temporal
		progression as well as bifurcation structure of any datatype.
