		Store Distance Matrices on Disk // Provides utilities to compute,
		store and access distance matrices on disk as file-backed
		matrices provided by the 'bigstatsr' package. File-backed
		distance matrices are stored as a symmetric matrix to
		facilitate out-of-memory operations on file-backed matrix while
		the in-memory 'dist' object stores only the lower diagonal
		elements. 'disto' provides an unified interface to work with
		in-memory and disk-based distance matrices.
