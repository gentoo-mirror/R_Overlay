		Prediction Intervals for Synthetic Control Methods //
		Implementation of estimation and inference procedures for
		Synthetic Control methods using least square, lasso, ridge, or
		simplex-type constraints. Uncertainty is quantified with
		prediction intervals as developed in Cattaneo, Feng, and
		Titiunik (2021) https://cattaneo.princeton.edu/papers/Cattaneo-
		Feng-Titiunik_2021_JASA.pdf.
