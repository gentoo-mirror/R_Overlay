		Plots for Visualizing the Data Produced by the 'irace' Package //
		Graphical visualization tools for analyzing the data produced
		by 'irace'. The 'iraceplot' package enables users to analyze
		the performance and the parameter space data sampled by the
		configuration during the search process. It provides a set of
		functions that generate different plots to visualize the
		configurations sampled during the execution of 'irace' and
		their performance. The functions just require the log file
		generated by 'irace' and, in some cases, they can be used with
		user-provided data.
