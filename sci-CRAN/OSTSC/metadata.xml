		Over Sampling for Time Series Classification // Oversampling of
		imbalanced univariate time series classification data using
		integrated ESPO and ADASYN methods. Enhanced Structure
		Preserving Oversampling (ESPO) is used to generate a large
		percentage of the synthetic minority samples from univariate
		labeled time series under the modeling assumption that the
		predictors are Gaussian. ESPO estimates the covariance
		structure of the minority-class samples and applies a spectral
		filer to reduce noise. Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling
		approach is a nearest neighbor interpolation approach which is
		subsequently applied to the ESPO samples. This code is ported
		from a 'MATLAB' implementation by Cao et al.
		doi:10.1109/TKDE.2013.37 and adapted for use with Recurrent
		Neural Networks implemented in 'TensorFlow'.
