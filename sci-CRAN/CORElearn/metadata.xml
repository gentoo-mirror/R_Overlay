		Classification, Regression and Feature Evaluation // A suite of
		machine learning algorithms written in C++ with the R interface
		contains several learning techniques for classification and
		regression. Predictive models include e.g., classification and
		regression trees with optional constructive induction and
		models in the leaves, random forests, kNN, naive Bayes, and
		locally weighted regression. All predictions obtained with
		these models can be explained and visualized with the
		'ExplainPrediction' package. This package is especially strong
		in feature evaluation where it contains several variants of
		Relief algorithm and many impurity based attribute evaluation
		functions, e.g., Gini, information gain, MDL, and DKM. These
		methods can be used for feature selection or discretization of
		numeric attributes. The OrdEval algorithm and its visualization
		is used for evaluation of data sets with ordinal features and
		class, enabling analysis according to the Kano model of
		customer satisfaction. Several algorithms support parallel
		multithreaded execution via OpenMP. The top-level documentation
		is reachable through ?CORElearn.
