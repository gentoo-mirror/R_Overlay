		'ATAforecasting' Modelling Interface for 'fable' Framework //
		Allows ATA (Automatic Time series analysis using the Ata
		method) models from the 'ATAforecasting' package to be used in
		a tidy workflow with the modeling interface of 'fabletools'.
		This extends 'ATAforecasting' to provide enhanced model
		specification and management, performance evaluation methods,
		and model combination tools. The Ata method (Yapar et al.
		(2019) doi:10.15672/hujms.461032), an alternative to
		exponential smoothing (described in Yapar (2016)
		doi:10.15672/HJMS.201614320580, Yapar et al. (2017)
		doi:10.15672/HJMS.2017.493), is a new univariate time series
		forecasting method which provides innovative solutions to
		issues faced during the initialization and optimization stages
		of existing forecasting methods. Forecasting performance of the
		Ata method is superior to existing methods both in terms of
		easy implementation and accurate forecasting. It can be applied
		to non-seasonal or seasonal time series which can be decomposed
		into four components (remainder, level, trend and seasonal).
