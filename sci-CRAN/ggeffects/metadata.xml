		Create Tidy Data Frames of Marginal Effects for 'ggplot' from
		Model Outputs // Compute marginal effects and adjusted
		predictions from statistical models and returns the result as
		tidy data frames. These data frames are ready to use with the
		'ggplot2'-package. Effects and predictions can be calculated
		for many different models. Interaction terms, splines and
		polynomial terms are also supported. The main functions are
		ggpredict(), ggemmeans() and ggeffect(). There is a generic
		plot()-method to plot the results using 'ggplot2'.
