		Create Tidy Data Frames of Marginal Effects for 'ggplot' from
		Model Outputs // Compute marginal effects at the mean or
		average marginal effects from statistical models and returns
		the result as tidy data frames. These data frames are ready to
		use with the 'ggplot2'-package. Marginal effects can be
		calculated for many different models. Interaction terms,
		splines and polynomial terms are also supported. The two main
		functions are 'ggpredict()' and 'ggaverage()', however, there
		are some convenient wrapper-functions especially for
		polynomials or interactions. There is a generic 'plot()'-method
		to plot the results using 'ggplot2'.
