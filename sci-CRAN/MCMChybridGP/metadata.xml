		Hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo using Gaussian Processes //
		Hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to simulate from a
		multimodal target distribution.  A Gaussian process
		approximation makes this possible when derivatives are unknown.
		The Package serves to minimize the number of function
		evaluations in Bayesian calibration of computer models using
		parallel tempering.  It allows replacement of the true target
		distribution in high temperature chains, or complete
		replacement of the target.  Methods used are described in,
		"Efficient MCMC schemes for computationally expensive posterior
		distributions", Fielding et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1198/TECH.2010.09195. The research presented in this
		work was carried out as part of the Singapore-Delft Water
		Alliance Multi-Objective Multi-Reservoir Management research
		programme (R-264-001-272).
