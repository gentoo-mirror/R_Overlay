		Classification of RNA Sequences using Complex Network Theory //
		It makes the creation of networks from sequences of RNA, with
		this is done the abstraction of characteristics of these
		networks with a methodology of threshold for the purpose of
		making a classification between the classes of the sequences.
		There are two data present in the 'BASiNET' package,
		"sequences" and "sequences2" with 11 and 10 sequences
		respectively. These sequences were taken from the data set used
		in the article (LI, Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin,
		2014) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311. These sequences are used to
		run examples.
