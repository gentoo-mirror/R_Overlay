		Classification of mRNA and lncRNA Sequences using Complex Network
		Theory // The methodology applied in this package starts with
		the creation of networks from RNA sequences, in this way the
		extraction of resources from these networks is performed with a
		threshold methodology, aiming to make a classification between
		the classes of the sequences. There are two data present in the
		package, "sequences" and "sequences2" with 11 and 10 sequences
		respectively. These sequences were taken from the data set used
		in the article (LI, Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin,
		2014) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311.
