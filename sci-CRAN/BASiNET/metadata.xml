		Classification of RNA Sequences using Complex Network Theory //
		It makes the creation of networks from sequences of RNA, with
		this is done the abstraction of characteristics of these
		networks with a methodology of threshold for the purpose of
		making a classification between the classes of the sequences.
		There are four data present in the 'BASiNET' package,
		"sequences", "sequences2", "sequences-predict" and
		"sequences2-predict" with 11, 10, 11 and 11 sequences
		respectively. These sequences were taken from the data set used
		in the article (LI, Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin,
		2014) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311, these sequences are used to
		run examples. The BASiNET was published on Nucleic Acids
		Research, (ITO, Eric; KATAHIRA, Isaque; VICENTE, Fbio; PEREIRA,
		Felipe; LOPES, Fabrcio, 2018) doi:10.1093/nar/gky462.
