		Comprehensive Groups of Experiments Analysis for Numerous
		Environments // In many cases, experiments must be repeated
		across multiple seasons or locations to ensure applicability of
		findings. A single experiment conducted in one location and
		season may yield limited conclusions, as results can vary under
		different environmental conditions. In agricultural research,
		treatment  location and treatment  season interactions play a
		crucial role. Analyzing a series of experiments across diverse
		conditions allows for more generalized and reliable
		recommendations. The 'CANE' package facilitates the pooled
		analysis of experiments conducted over multiple years, seasons,
		or locations. It is designed to assess treatment interactions
		with environmental factors (such as location and season) using
		various experimental designs. The package supports pooled
		analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the following designs: (1)
		'PooledCRD()': completely randomized design; (2) 'PooledRBD()':
		randomized block design; (3) 'PooledLSD()': Latin square
		design; (4) 'PooledSPD()': split plot design; and (5)
		'PooledStPD()': strip plot design. Each function provides the
		following outputs: (i) Individual ANOVA tables based on
		independent analysis for each location or year; (ii) Testing of
		homogeneity of error variances among distinct locations using
		Bartletts Chi-Square test; (iii) If Bartletts test is
		significant, 'Aitkens' transformation, defined as the ratio of
		the response to the square root of the error mean square, is
		applied to the response variable; otherwise, the data is used
		as is; (iv) Combined analysis to obtain a pooled ANOVA table;
		(v) Multiple comparison tests, including Tukey's honestly
		significant difference (Tukey's HSD) test, Duncans multiple
		range test (DMRT), and the least significant difference (LSD)
		test, for treatment comparisons. The statistical theory and
		steps of analysis of these designs are available in Dean et al.
		(2017)doi:10.1007/978-3-319-52250-0 and Ruz et al.
		(2024)doi:10.1007/978-3-031-65575-3. By broadening the scope of
		experimental conclusions, 'CANE' enables researchers to derive
		robust, widely applicable recommendations. This package is
		particularly valuable in agricultural research, where
		accounting for treatment  location and treatment  season
		interactions is essential for ensuring the validity of findings
		across multiple settings.
