		Algorithms for Implementing Free-Knot Splines // Algorithms for
		fitting free-knot splines for data with one independent
		variable and one dependent variable.  Four free-knot spline
		algorithms are provided for the case where the number of knots
		is known in advance.  A knot-search algorithm is provided for
		the case where the number of knots is not known in advance.  In
		addition, methods are available to compute the fitted values,
		the residuals, and the coefficients of the splines, and to plot
		the results, along with a method to summarize the results.
