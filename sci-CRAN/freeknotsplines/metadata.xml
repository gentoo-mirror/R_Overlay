		Free-Knot Splines // This package is for fitting free-knot
		splines for data with one independent variable and one
		dependent variable.  Four free-knot spline algorithms are
		provided for the case where the number of knots is known in
		advance.  A knot-search algorithm is provided for the case
		where the number of knots is not known in advance.  In
		addition, methods are available to compute the fitted values,
		the residuals, and the coefficients of the splines, and to plot
		the results, along with a method to summarize the results.
