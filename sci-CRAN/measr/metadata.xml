		Bayesian Psychometric Measurement Using 'Stan' // Estimate
		diagnostic classification models (also called cognitive
		diagnostic models) with 'Stan'. Diagnostic classification
		models are confirmatory latent class models, as described by
		Rupp et al. (2010, ISBN: 978-1-60623-527-0). Automatically
		generate 'Stan' code for the general loglinear cognitive
		diagnostic diagnostic model proposed by Henson et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1007/s11336-008-9089-5 and other subtypes that introduce
		additional model constraints. Using the generated 'Stan' code,
		estimate the model evaluate the model's performance using model
		fit indices, information criteria, and reliability metrics.
