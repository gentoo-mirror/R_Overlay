		ODE Generation and Integration // Generate systems of ordinary
		differential equations (ODE) and integrate them, using a domain
		specific language (DSL).  The DSL uses R's syntax, but compiles
		to C in order to efficiently solve the system.  A solver is not
		provided, but instead interfaces to the packages 'deSolve' and
		'dde' are generated.  With these, while solving the
		differential equations, no allocations are done and the
		calculations remain entirely in compiled code.  Alternatively,
		a model can be transpiled to R for use in contexts where a C
		compiler is not present.  After compilation, models can be
		inspected to return information about parameters and outputs,
		or intermediate values after calculations. 'odin' is not
		targeted at any particular domain and is suitable for any
		system that can be expressed primarily as mathematical
		expressions.  Additional support is provided for working with
		delays (delay differential equations, DDE), using interpolated
		functions during interpolation, and for integrating quantities
		that represent arrays.
