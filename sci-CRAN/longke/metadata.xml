		Nonparametric Predictive Model for Sparse and Irregular
		Longitudinal Data // The proposed method aims at predicting the
		longitudinal mean response trajectory by a kernel-based
		estimator. The kernel estimator is constructed by imposing
		weights based on subject-wise similarity on L2 metric space
		between predictor trajectories as well as time proximity. Users
		could also perform variable selections to derive functional
		predictors with predictive significance by the proposed
		multiplicative model with multivariate Gaussian kernels.
