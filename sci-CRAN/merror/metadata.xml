		Accuracy and Precision of Measurements // N=3 methods are used to
		measure each of n items. The data are used to estimate
		simultaneously systematic error (bias) and random error
		(imprecision). Observed measurements for each method or device
		are assumed to be linear functions of the unknown true values
		and the errors are assumed normally distributed. Pairwise
		calibration curves and plots can be easily generated. Unlike
		the 'ncb.od' function, the 'omx' function builds a one-factor
		measurement error model using 'OpenMx' and allows missing
		values, uses full information maximum likelihood to estimate
		parameters, and provides both likelihood-based and bootstrapped
		confidence intervals for all parameters, in addition to Wald-
		type intervals.
