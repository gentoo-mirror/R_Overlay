		Synergy/Antagonism Analyses of Drug Combinations // A
		comprehensive synergy/antagonism analyses of drug combinations
		with quality graphics and data. The analyses can be performed
		by Bliss independence and Loewe additivity models. 'COMBIA'
		provides improved statistical analysis and makes only very weak
		assumption of data variability while calculating bootstrap
		intervals (BIs). It is based on heteroscedasticity controlled
		resampling (bootstrapping) and includes a global (omnibus)
		test. Finally, package saves analyzed data, 2D and 3D plots
		ready to use in research publications. 'COMBIA' does not
		require manual data entry. Data can be directly input from
		wetlab experimental platforms for example fluostar, automated
		robots etc. One only needs to call a single function,
		analyzeCOMBO(), to perform all analysis (examples are provided
		with sample data).
