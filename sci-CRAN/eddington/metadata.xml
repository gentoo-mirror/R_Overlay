		Compute a Cyclist's Eddington Number // Compute a cyclist's
		Eddington number, including efficiently computing cumulative E
		over a vector. A cyclist's Eddington number https://en.wikipedi
		a.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling is the
		maximum number satisfying the condition such that a cyclist has
		ridden E miles or greater on E distinct days. The algorithm in
		this package is an improvement over the conventional approach
		because both summary statistics and cumulative statistics can
		be computed in linear time, since it does not require initial
		sorting of the data. These functions may also be used for
		computing h-indices for authors, a metric described by Hirsch
		(2005) doi:10.1073/pnas.0507655102. Both are specific
		applications of computing the side length of a Durfee square
