		Bayesian Time-Strat. Population Analysis // BTSPAS provides
		advanced Bayesian methods to estimate abundance and run-timing
		from temporally-stratified Petersen mark-recapture experiments.
		Methods include hierarchical modelling of the capture
		probabilities and spline smoothing of the daily run size. This
		version uses JAGS to sample from the posterior distribution.
