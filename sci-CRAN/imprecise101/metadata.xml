		Introduction to Imprecise Probabilities // An imprecise inference
		presented in the study of Walley (1996)
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02065.x is one of the
		statistical reasoning methods when prior information is
		unavailable. Functions and utils needed for illustrating this
		inferential paradigm are implemented for classroom teaching and
		further comprehensive research. Two imprecise models are
		demonstrated using multinomial data and 2x2 contingency table
		data. The concepts of prior ignorance and imprecision are
		discussed in lower and upper probabilities. Representation
		invariance principle, hypothesis testing, decision-making, and
		further generalization are also illustrated.
