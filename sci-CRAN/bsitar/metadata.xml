		Bayesian Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation Growth
		Curve Analysis // The Super Imposition by Translation and
		Rotation (SITAR) model is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed
		effect model that fits a natural cubic spline mean curve and
		and then aligns individual-specific growth curves to the mean
		curve via a set of random effects on both effects. For more
		details,  please see Cole (2010)  doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115. The
		non Bayesian version of the SITAR model can be fit by using an
		already available R package 'sitar'. However, the 'sitar'
		package allows modelling of a single outcome only. The 'bsitar'
		package, in addition to fitting SITAR to a single outcome,
		offers a great flexibility in fitting models of varying
		complexities that include joint modelling of multiple outcomes
		(multivariate model) such as height and weight, and to fit
		separate models defined by sub group such as gender when
		analyzing a single outcome. Furthermore, since the 'bsitar'
		package is a front-end to  the R package 'brms', it offers an
		excellent support for  post-processing of posterior draws which
		is available from the 'brms' package.
