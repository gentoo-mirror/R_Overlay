		Bayesian Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation Growth
		Curve Analysis // The Super Imposition by Translation and
		Rotation (SITAR) model is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed
		effect model that fits a natural cubic spline mean curve to the
		growth data, and aligns individual-specific growth curves to
		the underlying mean curve via a set of random effects (see
		Cole, 2010 doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115 for details). The non-
		Bayesian version of the SITAR model can be fit by using an
		already available R package 'sitar'. While 'sitar' package
		allows modelling of a single outcome only, the 'bsitar' package
		offers a great flexibility in fitting models of varying
		complexities that include joint modelling of multiple outcomes
		such as height and weight (multivariate model). Also, the
		'bsitar' package allows simultaneous analysis of a single
		outcome separately for sub groups defined by a factor variable
		such as gender. This is achieved by fitting separate models for
		each sub group (such as males and females for gender variable).
		An advantage of such approach is that posterior draws for each
		sub group are part of a single model object that makes it
		possible to compare coefficients across groups and test
		hypotheses. As 'bsitar' package is a front-end to the R package
		'brms', it offers an excellent support for post-processing of
		posterior draws via various functions that are directly
		available from the 'brms' package. In addition, the 'bsitar'
		package include various customized functions that allow
		estimation and visualization growth curves such as distance
		(increase in size with age) and velocity (change in growth rate
		as a function of age).
