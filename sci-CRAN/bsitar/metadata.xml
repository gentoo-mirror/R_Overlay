		Bayesian Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation Growth
		Curve Analysis // The Super Imposition by Translation and
		Rotation (SITAR) model is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed
		effect model that fits a natural cubic spline mean curve to the
		growth data and aligns individual-specific growth curves to the
		underlying mean curve via a set of random effects (see Cole,
		2010 doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115 for details). The non-Bayesian
		version of the SITAR model can be fit by using the already
		available R package 'sitar'. While the 'sitar' package allows
		modelling of a single outcome only, the 'bsitar' package offers
		great flexibility in fitting models of varying complexities,
		including joint modelling of multiple outcomes such as height
		and weight (multivariate model). Additionally, the 'bsitar'
		package allows for the simultaneous analysis of an outcome
		separately for subgroups defined by a factor variable such as
		gender. This is achieved by fitting separate models for each
		subgroup (for example males and females for gender variable).
		An advantage of this approach is that posterior draws for each
		subgroup are part of a single model object, making it possible
		to compare coefficients across subgroups and test hypotheses.
		Since the 'bsitar' package is a front-end to the R package
		'brms', it offers excellent support for post-processing of
		posterior draws via various functions that are directly
		available from the 'brms' package. In addition, the 'bsitar'
		package includes various customized functions that allow for
		the visualization of distance (increase in size with age) and
		velocity (change in growth rate as a function of age), as well
		as the estimation of growth spurt parameters such as age at
		peak growth velocity and peak growth velocity.
