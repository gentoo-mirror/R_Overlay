		Creating Tables of Excluded Observations // Instead of counting
		observations before and after a subset() call, the
		ExclusionTable() function reports the number before and after
		each subset() call together with the number of observations
		that have been excluded. This is especially useful in
		observational studies for keeping track how many observations
		have been excluded for each in-/ or exclusion criteria. You
		just need to provide ExclusionTable() with a dataset and a list
		of logical filter statements.
