		The FisherEM Algorithm to Simultaneously Cluster and Visualize
		High-Dimensional Data // FisherEM is an efficient algorithm for
		the unsupervised classification of high-dimensional data.
		FisherEM models and clusters the data in a discriminative and
		low-dimensional latent subspace. It also provides a low-
		dimensional representation of the clustered data. A sparse
		version of Fisher-EM algorithm is also provided.
