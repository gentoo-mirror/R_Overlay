		T Loux Doing R: Functions to Simplify Data Analysis and Reporting
		// Gives a number of functions to aid common data analysis
		processes and reporting statistical results in an 'RMarkdown'
		file. Data analysis functions combine multiple base R functions
		used to describe simple bivariate relationships into a single,
		easy to use function. Reporting functions will return character
		strings to report p-values, confidence intervals, and
		hypothesis test and regression results. Strings will be LaTeX-
		formatted as necessary and will knit pretty in an 'RMarkdown'
		document. The package also provides wrappers function in the
		'tableone' package to make the results knit-able.
