		Rank Selection for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization // Given the
		non-negative data and its distribution, the package estimates
		the rank parameter for Non-negative Matrix Factorization. The
		method is based on hypothesis testing, using a deconvolved
		bootstrap distribution to assess the significance level
		accurately despite the large amount of optimization error. The
		distribution of the non-negative data can be either Normal
		distributed or Poisson distributed.
