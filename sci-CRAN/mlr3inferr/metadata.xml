		Inference on the Generalization Error // An 'mlr3' extension that
		provides various resampling-based confidence interval (CI)
		methods for estimating the generalization error.  These CI
		methods are implemented as 'mlr3' measures, enabling the
		evaluation of individual algorithms on specific tasks as well
		as the comparison of different learning algorithms.
