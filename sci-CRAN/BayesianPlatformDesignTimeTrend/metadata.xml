		Simulate and Analyse Bayesian Platform Trial with Time Trend //
		Simulating the sequential multi-arm multi-stage or platform
		trial with Bayesian approach using the 'rstan' package, which
		provides the R interface for the Stan. This package supports
		fixed ratio and Bayesian adaptive randomization approaches for
		randomization. Additionally, it allows for the study of time
		trend problems in platform trials. There are demos available
		for a multi-arm multi-stage trial with two different null
		scenarios, as well as for Bayesian trial cutoff screening. The
		Bayesian adaptive randomisation approaches are described in:
		Trippa et al. (2012) doi:10.1200/JCO.2011.39.8420 and Wathen et
		al. (2017) doi:10.1177/1740774517692302. The randomisation
		algorithm is described in: Zhao W
		doi:10.1016/j.cct.2015.06.008. The analysis methods of time
		trend effect in platform trial are described in: Saville et al.
		(2022) doi:10.1177/17407745221112013 and Bofill Roig et al.
