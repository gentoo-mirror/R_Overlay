		Response Surface Designs with Neighbour Effects (rsdNE) //
		Response surface designs with neighbour effects are suitable
		for experimental situations where it is expected that the
		treatment combination administered to one experimental unit may
		affect the response on neighboring units as well as the
		response on the unit to which it is applied. Integrating these
		effects in the response surface model improves the experiment's
		precision (Jaggi, S., Sarika and Sharma, V.K.
		(2010)http://krishi.icar.gov.in/jspui/handle/123456789/4364;
		Verma A., Jaggi S., Varghese, E.,Varghese, C.,Bhowmik, A.,
		Datta, A. and Hemavathi M. (2021)DOI:
		10.1080/03610918.2021.1890123). This package includes sym(),
		asym1(), asym2() functions that generates response surface
		designs which are rotatable under a polynomial model of a given
		order without interaction term incorporating neighbour effects.
