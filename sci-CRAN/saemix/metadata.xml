		Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM)
		Algorithm // The 'saemix' package implements the Stochastic
		Approximation EM algorithm for parameter estimation in
		(non)linear mixed effects models. It (i) computes the maximum
		likelihood estimator of the population parameters, without any
		approximation of the model (linearisation, quadrature
		approximation,...), using the Stochastic Approximation
		Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm, (ii) provides
		standard errors for the maximum likelihood estimator (iii)
		estimates the conditional modes, the conditional means and the
		conditional standard deviations of the individual parameters,
		using the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm (see Comets et al.
		(2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v080.i03). Many applications of SAEM in
		agronomy, animal breeding and PKPD analysis have been published
		by members of the Monolix group. The full PDF documentation for
		the package including references about the algorithm and
		examples can be downloaded on the github of the IAME research
		institute for 'saemix': https://github.com/iame-researchCenter/
