		Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM)
		Algorithm // Implements the Stochastic Approximation EM
		algorithm for parameter estimation in (non)linear mixed effects
		models. The SAEM algorithm: - computes the maximum likelihood
		estimator of the population parameters, without any
		approximation of the model (linearisation, quadrature
		approximation,...), using the Stochastic Approximation
		Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm, - provides standard
		errors for the maximum likelihood estimator - estimates the
		conditional modes, the conditional means and the conditional
		standard deviations of the individual parameters, using the
		Hastings-Metropolis algorithm. Several applications of SAEM in
		agronomy, animal breeding and PKPD analysis have been published
		by members of the Monolix group (http://group.monolix.org/).
