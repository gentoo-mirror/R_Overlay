		Prediction and Clustering on the Torus by Conformal Prediction //
		Provides various tools of for clustering multivariate angular
		data on the torus. The package provides angular adaptations of
		usual clustering methods such as the k-means clustering,
		pairwise angular distances, which can be used as an input for
		distance-based clustering algorithms, and implements clustering
		based on the conformal prediction framework. Options for the
		conformal scores include scores based on a kernel density
		estimate, multivariate von Mises mixtures, and naive k-means
		clusters. Moreover, the package provides some basic data
		handling tools for angular data.
