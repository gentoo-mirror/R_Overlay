		Carbon-Related Assessment of Silvicultural Concepts // A
		simulation model and accompanying functions that support
		assessing silvicultural concepts on the forest estate level
		with a focus on the CO2 uptake by wood growth and CO2 emissions
		by forest operations. For achieving this, a virtual forest
		estate area is split into the areas covered by typical phases
		of the silvicultural concept of interest. Given initial area
		shares of these phases, the dynamics of these areas is
		simulated. The typical carbon stocks and flows which are known
		for all phases are attributed post-hoc to the areas and
		upscaled to the estate level. CO2 emissions by forest
		operations are estimated based on the amounts and dimensions of
		the harvested timber. Probabilities of damage events are taken
		into account.
