		Tools for Statistical Disclosure Control in Research Data Centers
		// Tools for researchers to explicitly show that their results
		comply to rules for statistical disclosure control imposed by
		research data centers. These tools help in checking descriptive
		statistics and models and in calculating extreme values that
		are not individual data. Also included is a simple function to
		create log files. The methods used here are described in the
		"Guidelines for the checking of output based on microdata
		research" by Bond, Brandt, and de Wolf (2015)
		https://cros.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2024-02/Output-checking-
		guidelines.pdf.
