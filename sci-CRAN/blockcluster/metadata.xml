		Co-Clustering Package for Binary, Categorical, Contingency and
		Continuous Data-Sets // Simultaneous clustering of rows and
		columns, usually designated by biclustering, co-clustering or
		block clustering, is an important technique in two way data
		analysis. It consists of estimating a mixture model which takes
		into account the block clustering problem on both the
		individual and variables sets. The 'blockcluster' package
		provides a bridge between the C++ core library build on top of
		the 'STK++' library, and the R statistical computing
		environment. This package allows to co-cluster binary

		doi:10.1007/s11634-013-0161-3 and categorical data-sets
		doi:10.1007/s11222-014-9472-2. It also provides utility
		functions to visualize the results. This package may be useful
		for various applications in fields of Data mining, Information
		retrieval, Biology, computer vision and many more. More
		information about the project and comprehensive tutorial can be
