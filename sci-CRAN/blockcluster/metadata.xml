		Coclustering Package for Binary, Categorical, Contingency and
		Continuous Data-Sets // Simultaneous clustering of rows and
		columns, usually designated by biclustering, co-clustering or
		block clustering, is an important technique in two way data
		analysis. It consists of estimating a mixture model which takes
		into account the block clustering problem on both the
		individual and variables sets. The blockcluster package
		provides a bridge between the C++ core library and the R
		statistical computing environment. This package allows to co-
		cluster binary, contingency, continuous and categorical data-
		sets. It also provides utility functions to visualize the
		results. This package may be useful for various applications in
		fields of Data mining,Information retrieval, Biology, computer
		vision and many more. More information about the project and
		comprehensive tutorial can be found on the link mentioned in
		URL.
