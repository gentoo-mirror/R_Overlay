		Coclustering Package for Binary, Categorical, Contingency and
		Continuous Data-Sets // Simultaneous clustering of rows and
		columns, usually designated by biclustering, co-clustering or
		block clustering, is an important technique in two way data
		analysis. It consists of estimating a mixture model which takes
		into account the block clustering problem on both the
		individual and variables sets. The blockcluster package
		provides a bridge between the C++ core library build on top of
		the 'STK++' library, and the R statistical computing
		environment. This package allows to co-cluster binary,
		contingency, continuous and categorical data-sets. It also
		provides utility functions to visualize the results. This
		package may be useful for various applications in fields of
		Data mining, Information retrieval, Biology, computer vision
		and many more. More information about the project and
		comprehensive tutorial can be found on the link mentioned in
		URL.
