		Iota Inter Coder Reliability for Content Analysis // Routines and
		tools for assessing the quality of content analysis on the
		basis of the Iota Reliability Concept. The concept is inspired
		by item response theory and can be applied to any kind of
		content analysis which uses a standardized coding scheme and
		discrete categories.  It is also applicable for content
		analysis conducted by artificial intelligence.  The package
		provides reliability measures for a complete scale as well as
		for every single category. Analysis of subgroup-invariance and
		error corrections are implemented. This information can support
		the development process of a coding scheme and allows a
		detailed inspection of the quality of the generated data.
		Equations and formulas working in this package are part of
		Berding et al. (2022)doi:10.3389/feduc.2022.818365 and Berding
		and Pargmann (2022,ISBN:978-3-8325-5581-8).
