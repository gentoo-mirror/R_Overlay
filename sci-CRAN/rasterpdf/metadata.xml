		Plot Raster Graphics in PDF Files // The ability to plot raster
		graphics in PDF files can be useful when one needs multi-page
		documents, but the plots contain so many individual elements
		that (the usual) use of vector graphics results in
		inconveniently large file sizes. Internally, the package plots
		each individual page as a PNG, and then combines them in one
		PDF file.
