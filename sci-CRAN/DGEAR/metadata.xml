		Differential Gene Expression Analysis with R // Analyses gene
		expression data derived from experiments to detect
		differentially expressed genes by employing the concept of
		majority voting with five different statistical models. It
		includes functions for differential expression analysis,
		significance testing, etc. It simplifies the process of
		uncovering meaningful patterns and trends within gene
		expression data, aiding researchers in downstream analysis.
