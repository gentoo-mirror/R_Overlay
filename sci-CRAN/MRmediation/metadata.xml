		A Causal Mediation Method with Methylated Region (MR) as the
		Mediator // A causal mediation approach under the
		counterfactual framework to test the significance of total,
		direct and indirect effects. In this approach, a group of
		methylated sites from a predefined region are utilized as the
		mediator, and the functional transformation is used to reduce
		the possible high dimension in the region-based methylated
		sites and account for their location information.
