		Estimation of Causal Effects with Generalized Additive Models //
		Implements various estimators for average treatment effects -
		an inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator, an augmented
		inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimator, and a standard
		regression estimator - that make use of generalized additive
		models for the treatment assignment model and/or outcome model.
		See: Glynn, Adam N. and Kevin M. Quinn. 2010. "An Introduction
		to the Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted Estimator."
