		Transcript Time Course Analysis // The analysis of microarray
		time series promises a deeper insight into the dynamics of the
		cellular response following stimulation. A common observation
		in this type of data is that some genes respond with quick,
		transient dynamics, while other genes change their expression
		slowly over time. The existing methods for detecting
		significant expression dynamics often fail when the expression
		dynamics show a large heterogeneity. Moreover, these methods
		often cannot cope with irregular and sparse measurements. The
		method proposed here is specifically designed for the analysis
		of perturbation responses. It combines different scores to
		capture fast and transient dynamics as well as slow expression
		changes, and performs well in the presence of low replicate
		numbers and irregular sampling times. The results are given in
		the form of tables including links to figures showing the
		expression dynamics of the respective transcript. These allow
		to quickly recognise the relevance of detection, to identify
		possible false positives and to discriminate early and late
		changes in gene expression. An extension of the method allows
		the analysis of the expression dynamics of functional groups of
		genes, providing a quick overview of the cellular response. The
		performance of this package was tested on microarray data
		derived from lung cancer cells stimulated with epidermal growth
		factor (EGF). Paper: Albrecht, Marco, et al.
