		Data-Driven Estimation for Multi-Threshold Accelerate Failure
		Time Model // Developed a data-driven estimation framework for
		the multi-threshold accelerate failure time (MTAFT) model. The
		MTAFT model features different linear forms in different
		subdomains, and one of the major challenges is determining the
		number of threshold effects. The package introduces a data-
		driven approach that utilizes a Schwarz' information criterion,
		which demonstrates consistency under mild conditions.
		Additionally, a cross-validation (CV) criterion with an order-
		preserved sample-splitting scheme is proposed to achieve
		consistent estimation, without the need for additional
		parameters. The package establishes the asymptotic properties
		of the parameter estimates and includes an efficient score-type
		test to examine the existence of threshold effects. The
		methodologies are supported by numerical experiments and
		theoretical results, showcasing their reliable performance in
		finite-sample cases.
