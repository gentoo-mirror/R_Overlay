		Bayesian Preference Learning with the Mallows Rank Model // An
		implementation of the Bayesian version of the Mallows rank
		model (Vitelli et al., Journal of Machine Learning Research,
		2018 http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/15-481.html; Crispino et al.,
		Annals of Applied Statistics, 2019 doi:10.1214/18-AOAS1203).
		Both Cayley, footrule, Hamming, Kendall, Spearman, and Ulam
		distances are supported in the models. The rank data to be
		analyzed can be in the form of complete rankings, top-k
		rankings, partially missing rankings, as well as consistent and
		inconsistent pairwise preferences. Several functions for
		plotting and studying the posterior distributions of parameters
		are provided. The package also provides functions for
		estimating the partition function (normalizing constant) of the
		Mallows rank model, both with the importance sampling algorithm
		of Vitelli et al. and asymptotic approximation with the IPFP
		algorithm (Mukherjee, Annals of Statistics, 2016
		doi:10.1214/15-AOS1389).
