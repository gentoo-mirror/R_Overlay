		Bayesian Preference Learning with the Mallows Rank Model // An
		implementation of the Bayesian version of the Mallows rank
		model (Vitelli et al., Journal of Machine Learning Research,
		2018 http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/15-481.html). Both Cayley,
		footrule, Kendall, and Spearman distances are supported in the
		models. The rank data to be analyzed can be the form of
		complete rankings, top-k rankings, partially missing rankings,
		as well as consistent pairwise preferences. Several functions
		for plotting and studying the posterior distributions of
		parameters are provided. The package also provides functions
		for estimating the partition function (normalizing constant) of
		the Mallows rank model, both with the importance sampling
		algorithm of Vitelli et al. and asymptotic approximation with
		the IPFP algorithm (Mukherjee, Annals of Statistics, 2016
		doi:10.1214/15-AOS1389).
