		For Streamlining Decision and Economic Evaluation Models using
		Grammar of Modeling // Provides tools for building decision and
		cost-effectiveness analysis models. It enables users to write
		these models concisely, simulate outcomesincluding
		probabilistic analysesefficiently using optimized vectorized
		processes and parallel computing, and produce results. The
		package employs a Grammar of Modeling approach, inspired by the
		Grammar of Graphics, to streamline model construction. For an
		interactive graphical user interface, see 'DecisionTwig' at
		https://www.dashlab.ca/projects/decision_twig/. Comprehensive
		tutorials and vignettes are available at
