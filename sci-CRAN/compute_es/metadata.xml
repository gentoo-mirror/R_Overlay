		Compute Effect Sizes // Several functions are available for
		calculating the most widely used effect sizes (ES), along with
		their variances, confidence intervals and p-values.  The output
		includes ES's of d (mean difference), g (unbiased estimate of
		d), r (correlation coefficient), z' (Fisher's z), and OR (odds
		ratio and log odds ratio). In addition, NNT (number needed to
		treat), U3, CLES (Common Language Effect Size) and Cliff's
		Delta are computed. This package uses recommended formulas as
		described in The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-
		Analysis (Cooper, Hedges,  Valentine, 2009).
