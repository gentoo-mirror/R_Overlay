		Calibration Functions for Analytical Chemistry // Simple
		functions for plotting linear calibration functions and
		estimating standard errors for measurements according to the
		Handbook of Chemometrics and Qualimetrics: Part A by Massart et
		al. (1997) There are also functions estimating the limit of
		detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). The
		functions work on model objects from - optionally weighted -
		linear regression (lm) or robust linear regression ('rlm' from
		the 'MASS' package).
