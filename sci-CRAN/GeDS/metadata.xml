		Geometrically Designed Spline Regression // Spline regression,
		generalized additive models and component-wise gradient
		boosting utilizing geometrically designed (GeD) splines. GeDS
		regression is a non-parametric method inspired by geometric
		principles, for fitting spline regression models with variable
		knots in one or two independent variables. It efficiently
		estimates the number of knots and their positions, as well as
		the spline order, assuming the response variable follows a
		distribution from the exponential family. GeDS models integrate
		the broader category of generalized (non-)linear models,
		offering a flexible approach to model complex relationships. A
		description of the method can be found in Kaishev et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s00180-015-0621-7 and Dimitrova et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1016/j.amc.2022.127493. Further extending its
		capabilities, GeDS's implementation includes generalized
		additive models (GAM) and functional gradient boosting (FGB),
		enabling versatile multivariate predictor modeling, as
		discussed in the forthcoming work of Dimitrova et al. (2025).
