		Geometrically Designed Spline Regression // Geometrically
		Designed Spline ('GeDS') Regression is a non-parametric
		geometrically motivated method for fitting variable knots
		spline predictor models in one or two independent variables, in
		the context of generalized (non-)linear models. 'GeDS'
		estimates the number and position of the knots and the order of
		the spline, assuming the response variable has a distribution
		from the exponential family. A description of the method can be
		found in Kaishev et al. (2016) doi:10.1007/s00180-015-0621-7
		and Dimitrova et al. (2017)
