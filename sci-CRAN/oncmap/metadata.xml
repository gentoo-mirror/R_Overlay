		Analyze Data from Electronic Adherence Monitoring Devices //
		Medication adherence, defined as medication-taking behavior
		that aligns with the agreed-upon treatment protocol, is
		critical for realizing the benefits of prescription
		medications. Medication adherence can be assessed using
		electronic adherence monitoring devices (EAMDs), pill bottles
		or boxes that contain a computer chip that records the date and
		time of each opening (or actuation). Before researchers can use
		EAMD data, they must apply a series of decision rules to
		transform actuation data into adherence data. The purpose of
		this R package ('oncmap') is to transform EAMD actuations in
		the form of a raw .csv file, information about the patient,
		regimen, and non-monitored periods into two daily adherence
		values -- Dose Taken and Correct Dose Taken.
