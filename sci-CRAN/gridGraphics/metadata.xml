		Redraw Base Graphics Using 'grid' Graphics // Functions to
		convert a page of plots drawn with the 'graphics' package into
		identical output drawn with the 'grid' package. The result
		looks like the original 'graphics'-based plot, but consists of
		'grid' grobs and viewports that can then be manipulated with
		'grid' functions (e.g., edit grobs and revisit viewports).
