		Extracts Environmental Data from 'ERDDAP' Web Services //
		Contains three functions that access environmental data from
		any 'ERDDAP' data web service. The rxtracto() function extracts
		data along a trajectory for a given "radius" around the point.
		The rxtracto_3D() function extracts data in a box. The
		rxtractogon() function extracts data in a polygon. All of those
		three function use the 'rerddap' package to extract the data,
		and should work with any 'ERDDAP' server. There are also two
		functions, plotBBox() and plotTrack() that use the 'plotdap'
		package to simplify the creation of maps of the data.
