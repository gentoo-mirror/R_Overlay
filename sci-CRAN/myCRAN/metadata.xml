		Graph of Daily and Cumulative Downloads of your Packages // Plot
		the daily and cumulative number of downloads of your packages.
		It is designed to be slightly more convenient than the several
		similar programs. If you want to run this each morning, you do
		not need to keep typing in the names of your packages. Also,
		this combines the daily and cumulative counts in one run, you
		do not need to run separate programs to get both types of
		information.
