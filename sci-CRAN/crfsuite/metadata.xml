		Conditional Random Fields for Labelling Sequential Data in
		Natural Language Processing // Wraps the 'CRFsuite' library
		https://github.com/chokkan/crfsuite allowing users to fit a
		Conditional Random Field model and to apply it on existing
		data. The focus of the implementation is in the area of Natural
		Language Processing where this R package allows you to easily
		build and apply models for named entity recognition, text
		chunking, part of speech tagging, intent recognition or
		classification of any category you have in mind. Next to
		training, a small web application is included in the package to
