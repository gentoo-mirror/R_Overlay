		Portfolio Analysis for Nature // The functions are designed to
		find the efficient mean-variance frontier or portfolio weights
		for static portfolio (called  Markowitz portfolio) analysis in
		resource economics or nature conservation. Using the nonlinear
		programming solver ('Rsolnp'), this package deals with the
		quadratic minimization of the variance-covariances without
		shorting (i.e., non-negative portfolio weights) studied in Ando
		and Mallory (2012) doi:10.1073/pnas.1114653109. See the
		examples, testing versions, and more details from:
		https://github.com/ysd2004/portn.
