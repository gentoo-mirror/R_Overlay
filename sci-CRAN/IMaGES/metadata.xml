		Independent Multiple-Sample Greedy Equivalence Search
		Implementation // Functions for the implementation of
		Independent Multiple-sample Greedy Equivalence Search (IMaGES),
		a causal inference algorithm for creating aggregate graphs and
		structural equation modeling data for one or more datasets.
		This package is useful for time series data with specific
		regions of interest. This implementation is inspired by the
		paper "Six problems for causal inference from fMRI" by Ramsey,
		Hanson, Hanson, Halchenko, Poldrack, and Glymour (2010)
		DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.08.065. The IMaGES algorithm uses
		a modified BIC score to compute goodness of fit of edge
		additions, subtractions, and turns across all datasets and
		returns a representative graph, along with structural equation
		modeling data for the global graph and individual datasets,
		means, and standard errors. Functions for plotting the
		resulting graph(s) are provided. This package is built upon the
		'pcalg' package.
