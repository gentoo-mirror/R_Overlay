		Extra Binary Relational and Logical Operators // Speed up common
		tasks, particularly logical or relational comparisons and
		routine follow up tasks such as finding the indices and
		subsetting. Inspired by mathematics, where something like: 3  x
		6 is a standard, elegant and clear way to assert that x is both
		greater than 3 and less than 6 (see for example
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator), a chaining
		operator is implemented. The chaining operator, %c%, allows
		multiple relational operations to be used in quotes on the
		right hand side for the same object, on the left hand side. The
		%e% operator allows something like set-builder notation (see
		for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation)
		to be used on the right hand side. All operators have built in
		prefixes defined for all, subset, and which to reduce the
		amount of code needed for common tasks, such as return those
		values that are true.
