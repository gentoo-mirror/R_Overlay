		Ports the Workflow of "Resampling Stats" Add-in to R //
		Resampling Stats (http://www.resample.com) is an add-in for
		running randomization tests in Excel worksheets. The workflow
		is (1) to define a statistic of interest that can be calculated
		from a data table, (2) to randomize rows ad/or columns of a
		data table to simulate a null hypothesis and (3) and to score
		the value of the statistic from many randomizations. The
		relative frequency distribution of the statistic in the
		simulations is then used to infer the probability of the
		observed value be generated by the null process (probability of
		Type I error). This package intends to translate this logic for
		R for teaching purposes. Keeping the original workflow is
		favored over performance.
