		Distance Metrics for High-Dimensional Clustering // We provide
		three distance metrics for measuring the separation between two
		clusters in high-dimensional spaces. The first metric is the
		centroid distance, which calculates the Euclidean distance
		between the centers of the two groups. The second is a ridge
		Mahalanobis distance, which incorporates a ridge correction
		constant, alpha, to ensure that the covariance matrix is
		invertible. The third metric is the maximal data piling
		distance, which computes the orthogonal distance between the
		affine spaces spanned by each class. These three distances are
		asymptotically interconnected and are applicable in tasks such
		as discrimination, clustering, and outlier detection in high-
		dimensional settings.
