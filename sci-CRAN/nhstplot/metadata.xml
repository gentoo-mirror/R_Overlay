		Plot Null Hypothesis Significance Tests // Illustrate graphically
		the most common Null Hypothesis Significance Testing
		procedures. More specifically, this package provides functions
		to plot Chi-Squared, F, t (one- and two-tailed) and z (one- and
		two-tailed) tests, by plotting the probability density under
		the null hypothesis as a function of the different test
		statistic values. Although highly flexible (color theme, fonts,
		etc.), only the minimal number of arguments (observed test
		statistic, degrees of freedom) are necessary for a clear and
		useful graph to be plotted, with the observed test statistic
		and the p value, as well as their corresponding value labels.
		The axes are automatically scaled to present the relevant part
		and the overall shape of the probability density function. This
		package is especially intended for education purposes, as it
		provides a helpful support to help explain the Null Hypothesis
		Significance Testing process, its use and/or shortcomings.
