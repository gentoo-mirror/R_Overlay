		Interface to the 'Briq' API // An interface to the 'Briq' API
		https://briq.github.io. 'Briq' is a tool that aims to promote
		employee engagement by helping employees recognize and reward
		each other. Employees can praise and thank one another (for
		achieving a company goal, for example) by giving virtual
		credits (known as 'briqs' or 'bqs') that can be redeemed for
		various rewards. The 'Briq' API lets you create, read, update
		and delete users, user groups, transactions and messages. This
		package provides functions that simplify getting the users,
		user groups and transactions of your organization into R.
