		Ecological Regression with Partial Identification // Estimate
		district-level bounds for 2x2 ecological inference based on the
		approach described in the forthcoming article Jiang et al.
		(2019), "Ecological Regression with Partial Identification",
		Political Analysis. Interval data regression is used to bound
		the nonidentified regression parameter in a linear contextual
		effects model, from which district-level bounds are derived.
		The approach here can be useful as a baseline of comparison for
		future work on ecological inference.
