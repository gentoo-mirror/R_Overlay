		Partially Balanced t-Designs (PBtDesigns) // The t-designs
		represent a generalized class of balanced incomplete block
		designs in which the number of blocks in which any t-tuple of
		treatments (t = 2) occur together is a constant. When the focus
		of an experiment lies in grading and selecting treatment
		subgroups, t-designs would be preferred over the conventional
		ones, as they have the additional advantage of t-tuple balance.
		t-designs can be advantageously used in identifying the best
		crop-livestock combination for a particular location in
		Integrated Farming Systems that will help in generating maximum
		profit. But as the number of components increases, the number
		of possible t-component combinations will also increase. Most
		often, combinations derived from specific components are only
		practically feasible, for example, in a specific locality,
		farmers may not be interested in keeping a pig or goat and
		hence combinations involving these may not be of any use in
		that locality. In such situations partially balanced t-designs
		with few selected combinations appearing in a constant number
		of blocks (while others not at all appearing) may be useful
		(Sayantani Karmakar, Cini Varghese, Seema Jaggi  Mohd Harun
		(2021)doi:10.1080/03610918.2021.2008436). Further, every
		location may not have the resources to form equally sized
		homogeneous blocks. Partially balanced t-designs with unequal
		block sizes (Damaraju Raghavarao  Bei Zhou
		(1998)doi:10.1080/03610929808832657. Sayantani Karmakar, Cini
		Varghese, Seema Jaggi  Mohd Harun (2022)." Partially Balanced
		t-designs with unequal block sizes") prove to be more suitable
		for such situations.This package generates three series of
		partially balanced t-designs namely Series 1, Series 2 and
		Series 3. Series 1 and Series 2 are designs having equal block
		sizes and with treatment structures 4(t + 1) and a prime
		number, respectively. Series 3 consists of designs with unequal
		block sizes and with treatment structure n(n-1)/2. This package
		is based on the function named PBtD() for generating partially
		balanced t-designs along with their parameters, information
		matrices, average variance factors and canonical efficiency
		factors.
