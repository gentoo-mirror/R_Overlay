		Psychometric Mixture Models // Psychometric mixture models based
		on 'flexmix' infrastructure. At the moment Rasch mixture models
		with different parameterizations of the score distribution
		(saturated vs. mean/variance specification), Bradley-Terry
		mixture models, and MPT mixture models are implemented. These
		mixture models can be estimated with or without concomitant
		variables. See vignette('raschmix', package = 'psychomix') for
		details on the Rasch mixture models.
