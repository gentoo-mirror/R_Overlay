		Precision-Recall and ROC Curves for Weighted and Unweighted Data
		// Computes the areas under the precision-recall (PR) and ROC
		curve for weighted (e.g., soft-labeled) and unweighted data. In
		contrast to other implementations, the interpolation between
		points of the PR curve is done by a non-linear piecewise
		function. In addition to the areas under the curves, the curves
		themselves can also be computed and plotted by a specific
		S3-method. References: Davis and Goadrich (2006)
