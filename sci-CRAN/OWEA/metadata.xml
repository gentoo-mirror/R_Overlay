		Optimal Weight Exchange Algorithm for Optimal Designs for Three
		Models // An implementation of optimal weight exchange
		algorithm Yang(2013) doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.806268 for three
		models. They are Crossover model with subject dropout,
		crossover model with proportional first order residual effects
		and interference model. You can use it to find either A-opt or
		D-opt approximate designs. Exact designs can be automatically
		rounded from approximate designs and relative efficiency is
		provided as well.
