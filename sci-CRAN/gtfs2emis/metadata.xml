		Estimating Public Transport Emissions from General Transit Feed
		Specification (GTFS) Data // A bottom up model to estimate the
		emission levels of public transport systems based on General
		Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. The package requires
		two main inputs: i) Public transport data in the GTFS standard
		format; and ii) Some basic information on fleet characteristics
		such as fleet age, technology, fuel and Euro stage. As it
		stands, the package estimates several pollutants at high
		spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be
		calculated for specific transport routes, trips, time of the
		day or for the transport system as a whole. The output with
		emission estimates can be extracted in different formats,
		supporting analysis on how emission levels vary across space,
		time and by fleet characteristics. A full description of the
		methods used in the 'gtfs2emis' model is presented in Vieira,
		J. P. B.; Pereira, R. H. M.; Andrade, P. R. (2022)
