		Integrative Conditional Autoregressive Horseshoe Model //
		Implements the integrative conditional autoregressive horseshoe
		model discussed in Jendoubi, T.,  Ebbels, T. (2018).
		"Integrative analysis of time course metabolic data and
		biomarker discovery". arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07767. The
		model consists in three levels: Metabolic pathways level
		modeling interdependencies between variables via a conditional
		auto-regressive (CAR) component , integrative analysis level to
		identify potential associations between heterogeneous omic
		variables via a Horseshoe prior and experimental design level
		to capture experimental design conditions through a mixed-
		effects model. The package also provides functions to simulate
		data from the model, construct pathway matrices, post process
		and plot model parameters.
