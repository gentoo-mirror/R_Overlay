		Shiny Apps for Lateral Flow Assays // Shiny apps for the
		quantitative analysis of images from lateral flow assays
		(LFAs). The images are segmented and background corrected and
		color intensities are extracted. The apps can be used to import
		and export intensity data and to calibrate LFAs by means of
		linear, loess, or gam models. The calibration models can
		further be saved and applied to intensity data from new images
		for determining concentrations.
