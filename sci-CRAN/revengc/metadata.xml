		Reverse Engineering Summarized Data // Decoupled (e.g. separate
		averages) and censored (e.g.  100 species) variables are
		continually reported by many well-established organizations
		(e.g. World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease
		Control and Prevention (CDC), World Bank, and various national
		censuses).  The challenge therefore is to infer what the
		original data could have been given summarized information.  We
		present an R package that reverse engineers decoupled and/or
		censored count data with two main functions.  The
		cnbinom.pars() function estimates the average and dispersion
		parameter of a censored univariate frequency table.  The rec()
		function reverse engineers summarized data into an uncensored
		bivariate table of probabilities.
