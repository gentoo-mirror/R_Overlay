		Reverse Engineering Decoupled and Censored Data // An issue
		occurs when authors do not reveal clear information.  Decoupled
		variables (e.g. separate averages) and numeric censoring (e.g.
		between ages 10-15) are reoccurring instances found in areas
		ranging from demographic and epidemiological data to ecological
		inference problems.  Decoupled variables provide no
		availability for cross tabulations while censoring obscures the
		true underlying values.  The revengc R package was developed to
		reverse engineer this unclear information that is continually
		reported by many well-established organizations (e.g. World
		Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and
		Prevention (CDC), World Bank, and various national censuses).
		There are two main functions in revengc and both fit data to a
		Poisson or Quasi-Poisson distribution.  The estimated_lambda
		function takes a univariate censored frequency table and
		approximates its lambda (average) value.  The rec function
		calculates an uncensored bivariate table from decoupled and
		summarized arguments.
