		Reverse Engineering Censored, Decoupled Residential Data for
		Population Density Estimation // A wealth of open source
		information is available that points to building usage
		including floor area of building size and likely occupancy. In
		the case of residential structures, census data provides a
		number of attributes including two values important to interior
		density estimation: household size (hhs) and area. If a
		national census revealed the raw data or provided a full
		uncensored contingency table (hhs x area), computing interior
		density as people/area would be straightforward. However,
		agencies rarely report this contingency table. Rather hhs and
		area are often decoupled and reported as separate univariate
		frequency tables, average values, or a combination of the two.
		In addition, the decoupled or contingency tables provided are
		typically left (, =), right (, =), and interval (-) censored.
		This type of information becomes problematic in estimating
		interior residential occupancy for numerous reasons. How can
		the people/area ratio be calculated when no affiliation between
		the variables exist? If a census reports a hhs average of 5.3,
		then how many houses are there with 1 person, 2 people,..., 10
		people? If a census reports that there are 100 houses in an
		area of 26-50 square meters, then how many houses are in 26,
		27,..., 50 square meters? The challenge therefore is to infer
		the people/area ratio when given decoupled and summarized data.
		The statistical package 'revengc' was designed to reverse
		engineer censored, decoupled census data into a likely hhs x
		area uncensored contingency table for estimating interior
		residential occupancy.
