		Multiple Imputation using Weighted Quantile Sum Regression // The
		`miWQS` package handles the uncertainty due to below the
		detection limit in a correlated component mixture problem.
		Researchers want to determine if a set/mixture of continuous
		and correlated components/chemicals is associated with an
		outcome and if so, which components are important in that
		mixture. These components share a common outcome but are
		interval-censored between zero and low thresholds, or detection
		limits, that may be different across the components. The
		`miWQS` package applies the multiple imputation (MI) procedure
		to the weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) methodology for
		continuous, binary, or count outcomes.  The two imputation
		models coded in `miWQS` package are: bootstrapping imputation
		(Lubin et.al (2004) doi:10.1289/ehp.7199) and Bayesian
		imputation.
