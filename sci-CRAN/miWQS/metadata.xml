		Multiple Imputation Using Weighted Quantile Sum Regression // The
		miWQS package handles the uncertainty due to below the
		detection limit in a correlated component mixture problem.
		Researchers want to determine if a set/mixture of continuous
		and correlated components/chemicals is associated with an
		outcome and if so, which components are important in that
		mixture. These components share a common outcome but are
		interval-censored between zero and low thresholds, or detection
		limits, that may be different across the components. This
		package applies the multiple imputation (MI) procedure to the
		weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) methodology for
		continuous, binary, or count outcomes (Hargarten  Wheeler
		(2020) doi:10.1016/j.envres.2020.109466). The imputation models
		are: bootstrapping imputation (Lubin et.al (2004)
		doi:10.1289/ehp.7199), univariate Bayesian imputation
		(Hargarten  Wheeler (2020) doi:10.1016/j.envres.2020.109466),
		and multivariate Bayesian regression imputation.
