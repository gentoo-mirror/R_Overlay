		Multiple Imputation using Weighted Quantile Sum Analysis //
		Consider a set/mixture of continuous, correlated, and censored
		components/chemicals that are reasonable to combine in an index
		and share a common outcome. These components are also interval-
		censored between zero and upper thresholds, or detection
		limits, that may be different among the components. The `miWQS`
		package applies the multiple imputation (MI) procedure to the
		weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) methodology for
		continuous, binary, or count outcomes.  In summary, MI consists
		of three stages: (1) imputation, (2) analysis, and (3) pooling.
		First,  the missing values are imputed by bootstrapping (Lubin
		et.al (2004) doi:10.1289/ehp.7199), Bayesian imputation, or
		placing the below the detection limits in the first quantile
		(BDLQ1) (Ward et.al. (2014) doi:10.1289/ehp.1307602). Second,
		the estimate.wqs() function implements WQS regression if the
		components are complete, imputed, or missing (Carrico et.al.
		(2014) doi:10.1007/s13253-014-0180-3) . If the data is missing,
		BDLQ1 is automatically implemented.  Lastly, the pool.mi()
		function calculates the pooled statistics according to Rubin's
		rules (Rubin 1987).
