		Creates a Model Matrix via Feature Hashing with a Formula
		Interface // Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick,
		is a method to transform features of a instance to a vector.
		Thus, it is a method to transform a real dataset to a matrix.
		Without looking up the indices in an associative array, it
		applies a hash function to the features and uses their hash
		values as indices directly. The method of feature hashing in
		this package was proposed in Weinberger et al. (2009). The
		hashing algorithm is the murmurhash3 from the digest package.
		Please see the README in
		https://github.com/wush978/FeatureHashing for more information.
