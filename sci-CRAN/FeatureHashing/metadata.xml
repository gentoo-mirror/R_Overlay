		Creates a Model Matrix via Feature Hashing with a Formula
		Interface // Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick,
		is a method to transform features of a instance to a vector.
		Thus, it is a method to transform a real dataset to a matrix.
		Without looking up the indices in an associative array, it
		applies a hash function to the features and uses their hash
		values as indices directly. The method of feature hashing in
		this package was proposed in Weinberger et al. (2009)
		arXiv:0902.2206. The hashing algorithm is the murmurhash3 from
		the 'digest' package. Please see the README in
		https://github.com/wush978/FeatureHashing for more information.
