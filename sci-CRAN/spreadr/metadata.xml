		Simulating Spreading Activation in a Network // The notion of
		spreading activation is a prevalent metaphor in the cognitive
		sciences. This package provides the tools for cognitive
		scientists and psychologists to conduct computer simulations
		that implement spreading activation in a network
		representation. The algorithmic method implemented in 'spreadr'
		subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal,
		and Adagarla (2011, Frontiers), who viewed activation as a
		fixed cognitive resource that could spread among nodes that
		were connected to each other via edges or connections (i.e., a
		network). See Vitevitch, M. S., Ercal, G.,  Adagarla, B.
		(2011). Simulating retrieval from a highly clustered network:

		Psychology, 2, 369. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00369 and Siew, C.
