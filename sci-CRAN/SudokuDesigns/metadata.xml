		Sudoku as an Experimental Design // Sudoku designs (Bailey et
		al., 2008doi:10.1080/00029890.2008.11920542) can be used as
		experimental designs which tackle one extra source of variation
		than conventional Latin square designs. Although Sudoku designs
		are similar to Latin square designs, only addition is the
		region concept. Some very important functions related to row-
		column designs as well as block designs along with basic
		functions are included in this package.
