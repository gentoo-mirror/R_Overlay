		Mediation using MZIP Model // We implement functions allowing for
		mediation analysis to be performed in cases where the mediator
		is a count variable with excess zeroes. First a function is
		provided allowing users to perform analysis for zero-inflated
		count variables using the marginalized zero-inflated Poisson
		(MZIP) model (Long et al. 2014 DOI:10.1002/sim.6293). Using the
		counterfactual approach to mediation and MZIP we can obtain
		natural direct and indirect effects for the overall population.
		Using delta method processes variance estimation can be
		performed instantaneously. Alternatively, bootstrap standard
		errors can be used. We also provide functions for cases with
		exposure-mediator interactions with four-way decomposition of
		total effect.
