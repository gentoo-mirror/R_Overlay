		A Neural Networks Framework // Explore neural networks in a layer
		oriented way, the framework is intended to give the user total
		control of the internals of a net without much effort. Use
		classes like PerceptronLayer to create a layer of Percetron
		neurons, and specify how many you want. The package does all
		the tricky stuff internally leaving you focused in what you
		want. I wrote this package during a neural networks course to
		help me with the problem set.
