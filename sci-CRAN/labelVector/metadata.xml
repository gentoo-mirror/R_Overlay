		Label Attributes for Atomic Vectors // Labels are a common
		construct in statistical software providing a human readable
		description of a variable. While variable names are succinct,
		quick to type, and follow a language's naming conventions,
		labels may be more illustrative and may use plain text and
		spaces. R does not provide native support for labels. Some
		packages, however, have made this feature available.  Most
		notably, the 'Hmisc' package provides labelling methods for a
		number of different object. Due to design decisions, these
		methods are not all exported, and so are unavailable for use in
		package development. The 'labelVector' package supports labels
		for atomic vectors in a light-weight design that is suitable
		for use in other packages.
