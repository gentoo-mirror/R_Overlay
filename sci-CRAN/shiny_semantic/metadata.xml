		'FomanticUI' Support for Shiny // Creating a great user interface
		for your Shiny apps can be a hassle, especially if you want to
		work purely in R and don't want to use, for instance HTML
		templates. This package adds support for a powerful UI library
		'FomanticUI' - https://fomantic-ui.com/ (before: Semantic). It
		also supports universal UI input binding that works with
		various DOM elements.
