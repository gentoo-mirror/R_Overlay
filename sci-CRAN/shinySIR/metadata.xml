		Interactive Plotting for Mathematical Models of Infectious
		Disease Spread // Provides interactive plotting for
		mathematical models of infectious disease spread. Users can
		choose from a variety of common built-in ordinary differential
		equation (ODE) models (such as the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models),
		or create their own. This latter flexibility allows 'shinySIR'
		to be applied to simple ODEs from any discipline. The package
		is a useful teaching tool as students can visualize how
		changing different parameters can impact model dynamics, with
		minimal knowledge of coding in R. The built-in models are
		inspired by those featured in Keeling and Rohani (2008)
		doi:10.2307/j.ctvcm4gk0 and Bjornstad (2018)
