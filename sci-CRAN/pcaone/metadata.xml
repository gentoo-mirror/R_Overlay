		Randomized Singular Value Decomposition Algorithms with
		'RcppEigen' // Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD)
		methods proposed in the 'PCAone' paper by Li (2022)
		doi:10.1101/2022.05.25.493261, where we implement and propose
		two RSVD methods. One is based on Yu (2017) arXiv:1704.07669
		single pass RSVD but with power iteration scheme. The other is
		our new window based RSVD.
