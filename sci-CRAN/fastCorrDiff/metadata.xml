		Fast Differential Correlation Matrix Screening // Fast spectral
		algorithms for differential analysis on large-scale correlation
		matrices of Li et. al. (2021) arXiv:2111.03721 are implemented.
		The methods can identify a group of genes exhibiting
		differential correlation patterns between two groups. For high-
		dimensional matrices, compressed spectral screening methods are
		also provided based on random subsampling. The work to build
		this package is partially supported by the NSF grant
		DMS-2015298.
