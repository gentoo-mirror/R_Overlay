		Wildlife Mortality Estimator for Low Fatality Rates and Imperfect
		Detection // Evidence of Absence software (EoA) is a user-
		friendly application for estimating bird and bat fatalities at
		wind farms and designing search protocols. The software is
		particularly useful in addressing whether the number of
		fatalities has exceeded a given threshold and what search
		parameters are needed to give assurance that thresholds were
		not exceeded. The models are applicable even when zero
		carcasses have been found in searches, following Huso et al.
