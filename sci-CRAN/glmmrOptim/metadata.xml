		Approximate Optimal Experimental Designs Using Generalised Linear
		Mixed Models // Optimal design analysis algorithms for any
		study design that can be represented or modelled as a
		generalised linear mixed model including cluster randomised
		trials, cohort studies, spatial and temporal epidemiological
		studies, and split-plot designs. See https://github.com/samuel-
		watson/glmmrBase/blob/master/README.md for a detailed manual on
		model specification. A detailed discussion of the methods in
		this package can be found in Watson and Pan (2022)
