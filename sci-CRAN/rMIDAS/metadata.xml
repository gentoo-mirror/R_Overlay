		Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders // A tool for
		multiply imputing missing data using 'MIDAS', a deep learning
		method based on denoising autoencoder neural networks. This
		algorithm offers significant accuracy and efficiency advantages
		over other multiple imputation strategies, particularly when
		applied to large datasets with complex features. Alongside
		interfacing with 'Python' to run the core algorithm, this
		package contains functions for processing data before and after
		model training, running imputation model diagnostics,
		generating multiple completed datasets, and estimating
		regression models on these datasets.
