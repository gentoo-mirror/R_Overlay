		Multiple-Direction Logrank Test // Implemented are the one-sided
		and two-sided multiple-direction logrank test for two-sample
		right censored data. In addition to the statistics p-values are
		calculated: 1. For the one-sided testing problem one p-value
		based on a wild bootstrap approach is determined. 2. In the
		two-sided case one p-value based on a chi-squared approximation
		and a second p-values based on a permutation approach are
		calculated. Ditzhaus, M. and Friedrich, S. (2018)
