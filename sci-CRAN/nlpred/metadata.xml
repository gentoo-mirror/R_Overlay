		Estimators of Non-Linear Cross-Validated Risks Optimized for
		Small Samples // Methods for obtaining improved estimates of
		non-linear cross-validated risks are obtained using targeted
		minimum loss-based estimation, estimating equations, and one-
		step estimation. Cross-validated area under the receiver
		operating characteristics curve (LeDell, Petersen, van der Laan
		(2015), doi:10.1214/15-EJS1035) and other metrics are included.
