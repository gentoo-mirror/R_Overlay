		Hydraulic Engineering Tools // The 'hydReng' package provides a
		set of functions for hydraulic engineering tasks and natural
		hazard assessments. It includes basic hydraulics (wetted area,
		wetted perimeter, flow, flow velocity, flow depth, and maximum
		flow) for open channels with arbitrary geometry under uniform
		flow conditions. For structures such as circular pipes, weirs,
		and gates, the package includes calculations for pressure flow,
		backwater depth, and overflow over a weir crest. Additionally,
		it provides formulas for calculating bedload transport. The
		formulas used can be found in standard literature on
		hydraulics, such as Bollrich (2019, ISBN:978-3-410-29169-5) or
		Hager (2011, ISBN:978-3-642-77430-0).
