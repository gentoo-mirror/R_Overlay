		Multiple Imputation in Cluster Analysis // Implementation of a
		framework for cluster analysis with selection of the final
		number of clusters and an optional variable selection
		procedure. The package is designed to integrate the results of
		multiple imputed datasets while accounting for the uncertainty
		that the imputations introduce in the final results. In
		addition, the package can also be used for a cluster analysis
		of the complete cases of a single dataset. The package also
		includes specific methods to summarize and plot the results.
		The methods are described in Basagana et al. (2013)
