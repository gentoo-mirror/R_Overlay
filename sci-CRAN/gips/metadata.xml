		Gaussian Model Invariant by Permutation Symmetry // Find the
		permutation symmetry group such that the covariance matrix of
		the given data is invariant under it. Discovering such a
		permutation decreases the number of observations needed to fit
		a Gaussian model, which is of great use when it is smaller than
		the number of variables. Even if that is not the case, the
		covariance matrix found with 'gips' approximates the actual
		covariance with less statistical error. The methods implemented
		in this package are described in Graczyk et al. (2022)
