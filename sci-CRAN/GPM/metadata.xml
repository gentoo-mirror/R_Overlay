		Gaussian Process Modeling of Multi-Response and Possibly Noisy
		Datasets // Provides a general and efficient tool for fitting a
		response surface to a dataset via Gaussian processes. The
		dataset can have multiple responses and be noisy (with
		stationary variance). The fitted GP model can predict the
		gradient as well. The package is based on the work of
		Bostanabad, R., Kearney, T., Tao, S. Y., Apley, D. W.  Chen, W.
		(2018) Leveraging the nugget parameter for efficient Gaussian
		process modeling. International Journal for Numerical Methods
		in Engineering, 114, 501-516.
