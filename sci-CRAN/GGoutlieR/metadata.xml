		Identify Individuals with Unusual Geo-Genetic Patterns //
		Identify and visualize individuals with unusual association
		patterns of genetics and geography using the approach of Chang
		and Schmid (2023) doi:10.1101/2023.04.06.535838. It detects
		potential outliers that violate the isolation-by-distance
		assumption using the K-nearest neighbor approach. You can
		obtain a table of outliers with statistics and visualize
		unusual geo-genetic patterns on a geographical map. This is
		useful for landscape genomics studies to discover individuals
		with unusual geography and genetics associations from a large
		biological sample.
