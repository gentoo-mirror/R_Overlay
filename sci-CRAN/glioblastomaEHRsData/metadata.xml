		Descriptive Analysis on 3 EHRs Datasets // Provides functions to
		load and analyze three open Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
		datasets of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, previously
		released under the Creative Common Attribution 4.0
		International (CC BY 4.0) license.  Users can generate basic
		descriptive statistics, frequency tables and save descriptive
		summary tables, as well as create and export univariate or
		bivariate plots.  The package is designed to work with the
		included datasets and to facilitate quick exploratory data
		analysis and reporting.  More information about these three
		datasets of EHRs of patients with glioblastoma can be found in
		this article: Gabriel Cerono, Ombretta Melaiu, and Davide
		Chicco, 'Clinical feature ranking based on ensemble machine
		learning reveals top survival factors for glioblastoma
		multiforme', Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research 8, 1-18
		(March 2024).  doi:10.1007/s41666-023-00138-1.
