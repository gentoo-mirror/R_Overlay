		Non Linear Least Squares with Inequality Constraints // We solve
		non linear least squares problems with optional equality and/or
		inequality constraints. Non linear iterations are globalized
		with back-tracking method. Linear problems are solved by dense
		QR decomposition from 'LAPACK' which can limit the size of
		treated problems. On the other side, we avoid condition number
		degradation which happens in classical quadratic programming
		approach. Inequality constraints treatment on each non linear
		iteration is based on 'NNLS' method (by Lawson and Hanson). We
		provide an original function 'lsi_ln' for solving linear least
		squares problem with inequality constraints in least norm sens.
		Thus if Jacobian of the problem is rank deficient a solution
		still can be provided. However, truncation errors are probable
		in this case. Equality constraints are treated by using a basis
		of Null-space. User defined function calculating residuals must
		return a list having residual vector (not their squared sum)
		and Jacobian. If Jacobian is not in the returned list, package
		'numDeriv' is used to calculated finite difference version of
		Jacobian. The 'NLSIC' method was fist published in Sokol et al.
