		Bayesian Framework for Computational Modelling // Derived from
		the work of Kruschke (2015, ISBN:9780124058880), the present
		package aim to provide a framework for conducting Bayesian
		analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
		utilizing the Just Another Gibbs Sampler ('JAGS', Plummer,
		2003, http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/). The initial version
		include several modules for conducting Bayesian equivalents of
		chi-squared tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple
		(hierarchical) regression, softmax regression, and for fitting
		data (e.g., structural equation modeling).
