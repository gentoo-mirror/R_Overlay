		Tools to Evaluate Disclosure Risk // Tools for calculating
		disclosure risk measures for microdata, including record-level
		and file-level measures. The record-level disclosure risk is
		estimated primarily using exhaustive tabulation. The file-level
		disclosure risk is estimated by fitting loglinear models on the
		observed sample counts in cells formed by key variables and
		their interactions. Funded by the National Center for Education
		Statistics. See Skinner and Shlomo (2008)
		doi:10.1198/016214507000001328 for a description of the file-
		level risk measures and the loglinear model approach.
