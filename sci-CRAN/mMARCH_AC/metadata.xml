		Processing of Accelerometry Data with 'GGIR' in mMARCH // Mobile
		Motor Activity Research Consortium for Health (mMARCH) is a
		collaborative network of studies of clinical and community
		samples that employ common clinical, biological, and digital
		mobile measures across involved studies. One of the main
		scientific goals of mMARCH sites is developing a better
		understanding of the inter-relationships between accelerometry-
		measured physical activity (PA), sleep (SL), and circadian
		rhythmicity (CR) and mental and physical health in children,
		adolescents, and adults. Currently, there is no consensus on a
		standard procedure for a data processing pipeline of raw
		accelerometry data, and few open-source tools to facilitate
		their development. The R package 'GGIR' is the most prominent
		open-source software package that offers great functionality
		and tremendous user flexibility to process raw accelerometry
		data. However, even with 'GGIR', processing done in a
		harmonized and reproducible fashion requires a non-trivial
		amount of expertise combined with a careful implementation. In
		addition, novel accelerometry-derived features of PA/SL/CR
		capturing multiscale, time-series, functional, distributional
		and other complimentary aspects of accelerometry data being
		constantly proposed and become available via non-GGIR R
		implementations.  To address these issues, mMARCH developed a
		streamlined harmonized and reproducible pipeline for loading
		and cleaning raw accelerometry data, extracting features
		available through 'GGIR' as well as through non-GGIR R
		packages, implementing several data and feature quality checks,
		merging all features of PA/SL/CR together, and performing
		multiple analyses including Joint Individual Variation
		Explained (JIVE), an unsupervised machine learning dimension
		reduction technique that identifies latent factors capturing
		joint across and individual to each of three domains of
		PA/SL/CR.  In detail, the pipeline generates all necessary
		R/Rmd/shell files for data processing after running 'GGIR'
		(v2.4.0) for accelerometer data. In module 1, all csv files in
		the 'GGIR' output directory were read, transformed and then
		merged. In module 2, the 'GGIR' output files were checked and
		summarized in one excel sheet. In module 3, the merged data was
		cleaned according to the number of valid hours on each night
		and the number of valid days for each subject. In module 4, the
		cleaned activity data was imputed by the average Euclidean norm
		minus one (ENMO) over all the valid days for each subject.
		Finally, a comprehensive report of data processing was created
		using Rmarkdown, and the report includes few exploratory plots
		and multiple commonly used features extracted from minute level
		actigraphy data.  Reference: Guo W, Leroux A, Shou S, Cui L,
