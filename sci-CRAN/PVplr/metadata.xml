		Performance Loss Rate Analysis Pipeline // The pipeline contained
		in this package provides tools used in the Solar Durability and
		Lifetime Extension Center (SDLE) for the analysis of
		Performance Loss Rates (PLR) in real world photovoltaic
		systems. Functions included allow for data cleaning, feature
		correction, power predictive modeling, PLR determination, and
		uncertainty bootstrapping through various methods
		doi:10.1109/PVSC40753.2019.8980928. The vignette "Pipeline
		Walkthrough" gives an explicit run through of typical package
		usage. This material is based upon work supported by the U.S
		Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and
		Renewable Energy (EERE) under Solar Energy Technologies Office
		(SETO) Agreement Number DE-EE-0008172. This work made use of
		the High Performance Computing Resource in the Core Facility
		for Advanced Research Computing at Case Western Reserve
		University.
