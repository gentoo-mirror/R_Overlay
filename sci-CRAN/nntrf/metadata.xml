		Supervised Data Transformation by Means of Neural Network Hidden
		Layer // A supervised transformation of datasets is performed.
		The aim is similar to that of Principal Component Analysis
		(PCA), that is, to carry out data transformation and
		dimensionality reduction, but in a non-linear supervised way.
		This is achieved by first training a 3-layer Multi-Layer
		Perceptron and then using the activations of the hidden layer
		as a transformation of the input features. In fact, it takes
		advantage of the change of representation provided by the
		hidden layer of a neural network. This can be useful as data
		pre-processing for Machine Learning methods in general,
		specially for those that do not work well with many irrelevant
		or redundant features. Rumelhart, D.E., Hinton, G.E. and
		Williams, R.J. (1986) "Learning representations by back-
		propagating errors" doi:10.1038/323533a0.
