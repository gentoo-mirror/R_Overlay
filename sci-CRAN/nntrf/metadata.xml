		Supervised Data Transformation by Means of Neural Network Hidden
		Layer // A supervised transformation of datasets is performed.
		The aim is similar to that of Principal Component Analysis
		(PCA), that is, to carry out data transformation and
		dimensionality reduction, but in a supervised way. This is
		achieved by first training a 3-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron and
		then using the activations of the hidden layer as a
		transformation of the input features. In fact, it takes
		advantage of the change of representation provided by the
		hidden layer of a neural network. This can be useful as data
		pre-processing for Machine Learning methods in general,
		specially for those that do not work well with many irrelevant
		or redundant features. It uses the nnet package under the hood.
