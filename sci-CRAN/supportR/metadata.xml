		Support Functions for Wrangling and Visualization // Suite of
		helper functions for data wrangling and visualization. The only
		theme for these functions is that they tend towards simple,
		short, and narrowly-scoped. These functions are built for tasks
		that often recur but are not large enough in scope to warrant
		an ecosystem of interdependent functions.
