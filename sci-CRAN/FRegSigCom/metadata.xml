		Functional Regression using Signal Compression Approach // Signal
		compression methods for function-on-function regression with
		functional response and functional predictors, including linear
		models with both scalar and functional predictors for a small
		number of functional predictors, linear models with functional
		predictors for a large number of functional predictors,
		stepwise selection for FOF models with two-way interactions,
		and nonlinear models. References are linked to via the URL
