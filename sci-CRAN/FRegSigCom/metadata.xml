		Functional Regression using Signal Compression Approach // Signal
		compression methods for functional regression. It includes
		various function-on-function (FOF) regression models such as
		the linear FOF model with functional response and both scalar
		and functional predictors for a small number of functional
		predictors, linear FOF models with a large number of functional
		predictors, linear FOF model for spiky data, stepwise selection
		for FOF models with two-way interactions, and nonlinear FOF
		models. It also includes scalar-on-function regression models
		with single (SOF) or multivariate (mSOF) scalar response
		variable, and SOF model for spiky data.
