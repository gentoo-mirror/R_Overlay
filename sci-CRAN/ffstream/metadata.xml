		Forgetting Factor Methods for Change Detection in Streaming Data
		// An implementation of the adaptive forgetting factor scheme
		described in Bodenham and Adams (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9684-8 which adaptively estimates the
		mean and variance of a stream in order to detect multiple
		changepoints in streaming data. The implementation is in 'C++'
		and uses 'Rcpp'. Additionally, implementations of the fixed
		forgetting factor scheme from the same paper, as well as the
		classic cumulative sum ('CUSUM') and exponentially weighted
		moving average ('EWMA') methods, are included.
