		Forgetting Factor Methods for Change Detection in Streaming Data
		// An implementation of the adaptive forgetting factor scheme
		described in Bodenham and Adams (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9684-8 which adaptively estimates the
		mean and variance of a stream in order to detect multiple
		changepoints in streaming data. The implementation is in C++
		and uses Rcpp. Additionally, implementations of the fixed
		forgetting factor scheme from the same paper, as well as the
		classic CUSUM and EWMA methods, are included.
