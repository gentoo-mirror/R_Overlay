		Taking the Pain Out of Catching and Handling Conditions // R has
		a unique way of dealing with warnings, errors, messages, and
		other conditions, but it can often be troublesome to users
		coming from different programming backgrounds. The purpose of
		this package is to provide flexible and useful tools for
		handling R conditions with less hassle. In order to lower the
		barrier of entry, keep code clean and readable, and reduce the
		amount of typing required, `catchr` uses a very simple domain-
		specific language that simplifies things on the front-end. This
		package aims to maintain a continuous learning curve that lets
		new users jump straight in to condition-handling, while
		simultaneously offering depth and complexity for more advanced
		users.
