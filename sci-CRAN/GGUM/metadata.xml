		Generalized Graded Unfolding Model // An implementation of the
		generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM) in R, see Roberts,
		Donoghue, and Laughlin (2000) doi:10.1177/01466216000241001).
		It allows to simulate data sets based on the GGUM. It fits the
		GGUM and the GUM, and it retrieves item and person parameter
		estimates. Several plotting functions are available (item and
		test information functions; item and test characteristic
		curves; item category response curves). Additionally, there are
		some functions that facilitate the communication between R and
		'GGUM2004'. Finally, a model-fit checking utility, MODFIT(), is
		also available.
