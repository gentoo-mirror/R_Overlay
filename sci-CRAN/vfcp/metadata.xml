		Computation of v Values for U and Copula C(U, v) // Computation
		the value of one of two uniformly distributed marginals if the
		copula probability value is known and the value of the second
		marginal is also known. Computation and plotting corresponding
		cumulative distribution function or survival function. The
		numerical definition of a common area limited by lines of the
		cumulative distribution function and survival function.
		Approximate quantification of the probability of this area.
