		Analyze Nominal Response Data with the Multinomial-Poisson Trick
		// Dichotomous responses having two categories can be analyzed
		with stats::glm() or lme4::glmer() using the family=binomial
		option. Unfortunately, polytomous responses with three or more
		unordered categories cannot be analyzed similarly because there
		is no analogous family=multinomial option. For between-subjects
		data, nnet::multinom() can address this need, but it cannot
		handle random factors and therefore cannot handle repeated
		measures. To address this gap, we implement the multinomial-
		Poisson trick (Baker 1994) doi:10.2307/2348134, which
		transforms nominal response data into counts for each
		categorical alternative. These counts are then analyzed using
		(mixed) Poisson regression. Omnibus analyses of variance can be
		run along with post hoc pairwise comparisons. For users wishing
		to analyze nominal responses from surveys or experiments, the
		functions in this package essentially act as though
		stats::glm() or lme4::glmer() had a family=multinomial option.
