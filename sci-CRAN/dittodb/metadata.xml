		A Test Environment for Database Requests // Testing and
		documenting code that communicates with remote databases can be
		painful. Although the interaction with R is usually relatively
		simple (e.g. data(frames) passed to and from a database),
		because they rely on a separate service and the data there,
		testing them can be difficult to set up, unsustainable in a
		continuous integration environment, or impossible without
		replicating an entire production cluster. This package
		addresses that by allowing you to make recordings from your
		database interactions and then play them back while testing (or
		in other contexts) all without needing to spin up or have
		access to the database your code would typically connect to.
