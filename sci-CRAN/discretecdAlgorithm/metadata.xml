		Coordinate-Descent Algorithm for Learning Sparse Discrete
		Bayesian Networks // Structure learning of Bayesian network
		using coordinate-descent algorithm. This algorithm is designed
		for discrete network assuming a multinomial data set, and we
		use a multi-logit model to do the regression. The algorithm is
		described in Gu, Fu and Zhou (2016) arXiv:1403.2310.
