		Sensory and Consumer Data Mapping // External preference mapping
		technique is commonly used in sensory analysis field to explain
		consumer preferences in function of sensory attributes of
		products Danzart(1998) (doi:10.1006/fstl.1998.0373). The
		package provides map visualization with options in dimension
		reduction methods and prediction models from linear and non
		linear regressions. A smoothed version of the map performed
		using LOESS algorithm is available. A comparison approach of
		maps stability from different features before and after
		smoothing is provided. A 'shiny' application is included. It
		presents an easy GUI for the implemented functions as well as a
		comparative tool of fit models using several criteria. Basic
		analysis such as characterization of products, panelists and
		sessions likewise consumer segmentation are available.
