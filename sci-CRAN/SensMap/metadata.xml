		SensMap package provides the mapping visualization from several
		features : options in dimension reduction methods and
		prediction models ranging from linear to non linear
		regressions. A smoothed version of the map performed using
		LOESS algorithm is available. A selection process of maps
		stability is provided. A 'shiny' application is included. It
		presents an easy GUI for the implemented functions as well as a
		comparative tool of fit models using several criteria. Basic
