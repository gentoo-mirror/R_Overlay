		Sensory and Consumer Data Mapping // Obtain external preference
		map to explain consumer preferences in function of sensory
		attributes of products (K.Greenhoff et al. (1994)
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-2171-6_6) with options in dimension
		reduction methods and prediction models from linear and non
		linear regressions. A smoothed version of the map is available
		and a comparison of maps stability from different features
		before and after smoothing is provided which may help
		industrials to make good decisions about characteristics of new
		product development. A 'shiny' application is included. It
		presents an easy GUI for the implemented functions as well as a
		comparative tool of fit models performance using several
		criteria. Basic analysis such as characterization of products,
		panelists and sessions likewise consumers segmentation are
		available.
