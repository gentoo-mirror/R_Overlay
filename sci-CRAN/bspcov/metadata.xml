		Bayesian Sparse Estimation of a Covariance Matrix // Provides
		functions which perform Bayesian estimations of a covariance
		matrix for multivariate normal data. Assumes that the
		covariance matrix is sparse or band matrix and positive-
		definite. This software has been developed using funding
		supported by Basic Science Research Program through the
		National Research Foundation of Korea ('NRF') funded by the
		Ministry of Education ('RS-2023-00211979',
