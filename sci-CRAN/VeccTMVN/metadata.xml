		Multivariate Normal Probabilities using Vecchia Approximation //
		Under a different representation of the multivariate normal
		(MVN) probability, we can use the Vecchia approximation to
		sample the integrand at a linear complexity with respect to n.
		Additionally, both the SOV algorithm from Genz (92) and the
		exponential-tilting method from Botev (2017) can be adapted to
		linear complexity. The reference for the method implemented in
		this package is Jian Cao and Matthias Katzfuss (2024) "Linear-
		Cost Vecchia Approximation of Multivariate Normal
		Probabilities" doi:10.48550/arXiv.2311.09426. Two major
		references for the development of our method are Alan Genz
		(1992) "Numerical Computation of Multivariate Normal
		Probabilities" doi:10.1080/10618600.1992.10477010 and Z. I.

		Simulation and Estimation via Minimax Tilting"
