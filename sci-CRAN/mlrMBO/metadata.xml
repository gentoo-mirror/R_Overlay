		A Toolbox for Model-Based Optimization of Expensive Black-Box
		Functions // Flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-
		based optimization ('MBO'), also known as Bayesian
		optimization. It is designed for both single- and multi-
		objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and
		conditional parameters. The machine learning toolbox 'mlr'
		provide dozens of regression learners to model the performance
		of the target algorithm with respect to the parameter settings.
		It provides many different infill criteria to guide the search
		process. Additional features include multi-point batch
		proposal, parallel execution as well as visualization and
		sophisticated logging mechanisms, which is especially useful
		for teaching and understanding of algorithm behavior. 'mlrMBO'
		is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single
		components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for
		specific use cases.
