		A Toolbox for Model-Based Optimization of Expensive Black-Box
		Functions // Flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-
		based optimization ('MBO'), also known as Bayesian
		optimization. It is designed for both single- and multi-
		objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and
		conditional parameters. The machine learning toolbox 'mlr'
		provide dozens of regression learners to model the performance
		of the target algorithm with respect to the parameter settings.
		It provides many different infill criteria to guide the search
		process. Additional features include multipoint batch proposal,
		parallel execution as well as visualization and sophisticated
		logging mechanisms, which is especially useful for teaching and
		understanding of algorithm behavior. 'mlrMBO' is implemented in
		a modular fashion, such that single components can be easily
		replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases.
