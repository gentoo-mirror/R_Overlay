		Feature Identification Between Metabolome and Microbiome in
		Disease and Health // A strategy that provides the
		identification of metabolome and microbiome (Bi-omics) feature.
		It is able to screen out key/driving features (metabolites,
		microbes, and pathway functions) by an integrated importance
		score (IIS),combining sub-scores derived from difference,
		correlation, abundance, and network analysis. It is able to
		identify microbe-function-metabolite chains and to rank
		association pairs within specific functions.
