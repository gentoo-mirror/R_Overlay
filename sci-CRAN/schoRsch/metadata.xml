		Tools for Analyzing Factorial Experiments // Offers a helping
		hand to psychologists and other behavioral scientists who
		routinely deal with experimental data from factorial
		experiments. It includes several functions to format output
		from other R functions according to the style guidelines of the
		APA (American Psychological Association). This formatted output
		can be copied directly into manuscripts to facilitate data
		reporting. These features are backed up by a toolkit of several
		small helper functions, e.g., offering out-of-the-box outlier
		removal. The package lends its name to Georg "Schorsch"
		Schuessler, ingenious technician at the Department of
		Psychology III, University of Wuerzburg. For details on the
		implemented methods, see Roland Pfister and Markus Janczyk
