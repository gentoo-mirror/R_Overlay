		Easily Send Rewards and Incentives with 'Tremendous' from R // A
		slightly-opinionated R interface for the 'Tremendous' API
		(https://www.tremendous.com/). In addition to supporting GET
		and POST requests, 'tremendousr' has, dare I say, tremendously
		intuitive functions for sending digital rewards and incentives
		directly from R.
