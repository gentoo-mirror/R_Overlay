		R Port of the 'Scilab' Neldermead Module // Provides several
		direct search optimization algorithms based on the simplex
		method. The provided algorithms are direct search algorithms,
		i.e. algorithms which do not use the derivative of the cost
		function. They are based on the update of a simplex. The
		following algorithms are available: the fixed shape simplex
		method of Spendley, Hext and Himsworth (unconstrained
		optimization with a fixed shape simplex), the variable shape
		simplex method of Nelder and Mead (unconstrained optimization
		with a variable shape simplex made), and Box's complex method
		(constrained optimization with a variable shape simplex).
