		Laplace Factor Model Analysis and Evaluation // Enables the
		generation of Laplace factor models across diverse Laplace
		distributions and facilitates the application of Sparse Online
		Principal Component (SOPC), Incremental Principal Component
		(IPC), Parallel Principal Component (PPC), Sparse Approximate
		Principal Component (SAPC), Standard Principal Component (SPC),
		and Farm Test methods to these models. Evaluates the efficacy
		of these methods within the context of Laplace factor models by
		scrutinizing parameter estimation accuracy, mean square error,
		and the degree of sparsity.
