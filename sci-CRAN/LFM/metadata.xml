		Laplace Factor Model Analysis and Evaluation // Enables the
		generation of Laplace factor models across diverse Laplace
		distributions and facilitates the application of Sparse Online
		Principal Component (SOPC), Incremental Principal Component
		(IPC), Perturbation Principal Component (PPC), Stochastic
		Approximation Principal Component (SAPC), Sparse Principal
		Component (SPC) and other PC methods and Farm Test methods to
		these models. Evaluates the efficacy of these methods within
		the context of Laplace factor models by scrutinizing parameter
		estimation accuracy, mean square error, and the degree of
		sparsity.
