		Hidden Markov Model for Return Time-Series Based on Lambda
		Distribution // Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on symmetric
		lambda distribution framework is implemented for the study of
		return time-series in the financial market. Major features in
		the SP500 index, such as regime identification, volatility
		clustering, and anti-correlation between return and volatility,
		can be extracted from HMM cleanly. Univariate symmetric lambda
		distribution is essentially a location-scale family of power-
		exponential distribution. Such distribution is suitable for
		describing highly leptokurtic time series obtained from the
		financial market. It provides a theoretically solid foundation
		to explore such data where the normal distribution is not
		adequate. The HMM implementation follows closely the book:
		"Hidden Markov Models for Time Series", by Zucchini, MacDonald,
		Langrock (2016).
