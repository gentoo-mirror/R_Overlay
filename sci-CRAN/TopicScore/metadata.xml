		The Topic SCORE Algorithm to Fit Topic Models // Provides
		implementation of the "Topic SCORE" algorithm that is proposed
		by Tracy Ke and Minzhe Wang. The singular value decomposition
		step is optimized through the usage of svds() function in
		'RSpectra' package, on a 'dgRMatrix' sparse matrix. Also
		provides a column-wise error measure in the word-topic matrix
		A, and an algorithm for recovering the topic-document matrix W
		given A and D based on quadratic programming. The details about
		the techniques are explained in the paper "A new SVD approach
		to optimal topic estimation" by Tracy Ke and Minzhe Wang (2017)
		arXiv:1704.07016.
