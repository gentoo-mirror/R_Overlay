		Phase I Control Charts (with Emphasis on Distribution-Free
		Methods) // Statistical methods for retrospectively detecting
		changes in location and/or dispersion of univariate and
		multivariate variables. Data values are assumed to be
		independent, can be individual (one observation at each instant
		of time) or subgrouped (more than one observation at each
		instant of time). Control limits are computed, often using a
		permutation approach, so that a prescribed false alarm
		probability is guaranteed without making any parametric
		assumptions on the stable (in-control) distribution. See G.
		Capizzi and G. Masarotto (2018) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-75295-2_1
		for an introduction to the package.
