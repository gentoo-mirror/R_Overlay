		Multidimensional Item Response Theory // Analysis of discrete
		response data using unidimensional and multidimensional item
		analysis models under the Item Response Theory paradigm
		(Chalmers (2012) doi:10.18637/jss.v048.i06). Exploratory and
		confirmatory item factor analysis models are estimated with
		quadrature (EM) or stochastic (MHRM) methods. Confirmatory bi-
		factor and two-tier models are available for modeling item
		testlets using dimension reduction EM algorithms, while
		multiple group analyses and mixed effects designs are included
		for detecting differential item, bundle, and test functioning,
		and for modeling item and person covariates. Finally, latent
		class models such as the DINA, DINO, multidimensional latent
		class, mixture IRT models, and zero-inflated response models
		are supported.
