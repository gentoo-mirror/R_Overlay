		Multidimensional Item Response Theory // Analysis of dichotomous
		and polytomous response data using unidimensional and
		multidimensional latent trait models under the Item Response
		Theory paradigm (Chalmers (2012) doi:10.18637/jss.v048.i06).
		Exploratory and confirmatory models can be estimated with
		quadrature (EM) or stochastic (MHRM) methods. Confirmatory bi-
		factor and two-tier analyses are available for modeling item
		testlets. Multiple group analysis and mixed effects designs
		also are available for detecting differential item and test
		functioning as well as modeling item and person covariates.
		Finally, latent class models such as the DINA, DINO,
		multidimensional latent class, and several other discrete
		latent variable models, including mixture and zero-inflated
		response models, are supported.
