		Goodness-of-fit functions for comparison of simulated and
		observed hydrological time series // S3 functions implementing
		both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit measures between
		observed and simulated values, mainly oriented to be used
		during the calibration, validation, and application of
		hydrological models. Missing values in observed and/or
		simulated values can be removed before computations. Comments /
		questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed.
