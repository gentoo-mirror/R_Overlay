		Track User-Defined Environment Names // Set of functions to keep
		track of user-defined environment names which cannot be
		retrieved with the built-in function environmentName. The main
		function in this package for this purpose has a similar name:
		environment_name(), which returns the name of the environment
		given as parameter, be it a system, package, user-defined, or
		function execution environment. The package also provides
		additional functionality, the most important ones being: - A
		function (obj_find()) to search for objects. This function
		extends the functionality of exists() as follows: objects are
		searched recursively within all user-defined environments. - A
		way to get the stack of calling function names
		(get_fun_calling_chain()), in an easier way than the built-in
		function sys.call(), which requires further non-intuitive
		parsing of the output. - A function (get_obj_address()) to
		retrieve the memory address of an object. This package was
		inspired by an "R for developers" course given by Andrea Spano
		from Quantide (http://www.quantide.com/courses-overview/r-for-
		developers) and by a post by Gabor Grothendieck at the R-Help
		forum
		(https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-July/245646.html).
