		Robust Estimation for Seemingly Unrelated Regression Models //
		Data sets are often corrupted by outliers. When data are
		multivariate outliers can be classified as case-wise or cell-
		wise. The latters are particularly challenge to handle. We
		implement a robust estimation procedure for Seemingly Unrelated
		Regression Models which is able to cope well with both type of
		outliers. Giovanni Saraceno, Fatemah Alqallaf, Claudio
