		Efficient Estimation of Discrete-Time Multivariate Frailty Model
		Using Exact Likelihood Function for Grouped Survival Data //
		The core of this 'Rcpp' based package is several functions to
		estimate the baseline hazard, frailty variance, and fixed
		effect parameter for a discrete-time shared frailty model with
		random effects. The functions are designed to analyze grouped
		time-to-event data accounting for family structure of related
		individuals (i.e., trios). The core functions include two
		processes: (1) evaluate the multivariable integration to
		compute the exact proportional hazards model based likelihood
		and (2) estimate the desired parameters using maximum
		likelihood estimation. The integration is evaluated by the
		'Cuhre' algorithm from the 'Cuba' library (Hahn, T., Cuba-a
		library for multidimensional numerical integration, Comput.
		Phys. Commun. 168, 2005, 78-95 doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2005.01.010),
		and the source files of the 'Cuhre' function are included in
		this package. The maximization process is carried out using
		Brent's algorithm, with the 'C++' code file from John Burkardt
		and John Denker (Brent, R.,Algorithms for Minimization without
		Derivatives, Dover, 2002, ISBN 0-486-41998-3).
