		Some Additional Multiple Imputation Functions, Especially for
		'mice' // Contains some auxiliary functions for multiple
		imputation which complements existing functionality in R. In
		addition to some utility functions, main features include
		plausible value imputation, multilevel imputation functions
		(arbitrary number of levels, hierarchical and non-hierarchical
		datasets), imputation using partial least squares (PLS) for
		high dimensional predictors, and nested multiple imputation.
