		Robust Copy Number Alteration Detection (RCNA) // Detects copy
		number alteration events in targeted exon sequencing data for
		tumor samples without matched normal controls. The advantage of
		this method is that it can be applied to smaller sequencing
		panels including evaluations of exon, transcript, gene, or even
		user specified genetic regions of interest. Functions in the
		package include steps for GC-content correction, calculation of
		quantile based normal karyotype ranges, and calculation of
		feature score.  Cutoffs for "normal" quantile and score are
		user-adjustable.
