		Simulate Demand and Attributes for New Products // Simulate
		demand and attributes for ready to launch new products during
		their life cycle, or during their introduction and growth
		phases. You provide the number of products, attributes, time
		periods and/or other parameters and 'npdsim' can simulate for
		you the demand for each product during the considered time
		periods, and the attributes of each product. The simulation for
		the demand is based on the idea that each product has a shape
		and a level, where the level is the cumulative demand over the
		considered time periods, and the shape is the normalized demand
		across those time periods.
