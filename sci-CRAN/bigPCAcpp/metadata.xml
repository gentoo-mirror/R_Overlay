		Principal Component Analysis for 'bigmemory' Matrices // High
		performance principal component analysis routines that operate
		directly on 'bigmemory::big.matrix' objects. The package avoids
		materialising large matrices in memory by streaming data
		through 'BLAS' and 'LAPACK' kernels and provides helpers to
		derive scores, loadings, correlations, and contribution
		diagnostics, including utilities that stream results into
		'bigmemory'-backed matrices for file-based workflows.
		Additional interfaces expose 'scalable' singular value
		decomposition, robust PCA, and robust SVD algorithms so that
		users can explore large matrices while tempering the influence
		of outliers. 'Scalable' principal component analysis is also
		implemented, Elgamal, Yabandeh, Aboulnaga, Mustafa, and Hefeeda
