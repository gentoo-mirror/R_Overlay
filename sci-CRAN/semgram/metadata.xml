		Extracting Semantic Motifs from Textual Data // A framework for
		extracting semantic motifs around entities in textual data. It
		implements an entity-centered semantic grammar that
		distinguishes six classes of motifs: actions of an entity,
		treatments of an entity, agents acting upon an entity, patients
		acted upon by an entity, characterizations of an entity, and
		possessions of an entity. Motifs are identified by applying a
		set of extraction rules to a parsed text object that includes
		part-of-speech tags and dependency annotations - such as those
		generated by 'spacyr'. For further reference, see: Stuhler
