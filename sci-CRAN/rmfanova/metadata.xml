		Repeated Measures Functional Analysis of Variance // The provided
		package implements the statistical tests for the functional
		repeated measures analysis problem (Kurylo and Smaga, 2023,
		arXiv:2306.03883). These procedures enable us to verify the
		overall hypothesis regarding equality, as well as hypotheses
		for pairwise comparisons (i.e., post hoc analysis) of mean
		functions corresponding to repeated experiments.
