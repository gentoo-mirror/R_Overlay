		Estimation and Additional Tools for Alternative Shared Frailty
		Models // Provide estimation and data generation tools for some
		new multivariate frailty models. This version includes the
		gamma, inverse Gaussian, weighted Lindley, Birnbaum-Saunders,
		truncated normal, mixture of inverse Gaussian and mixture of
		Birnbaum-Saunders as the distribution for the frailty terms.
		For the basal model, it is considered a parametric approach
		based on the exponential, Weibull and the piecewise exponential
		distributions as well as a semiparametric approach. For
		details, see Gallardo and Bourguignon (2022)
