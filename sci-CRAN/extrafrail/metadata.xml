		Estimation and Additional Tools for Alternative Shared Frailty
		Models // Provide estimation and data generation tools for some
		new multivariate frailty models. This version includes the
		gamma, inverse Gaussian, weighted Lindley and Birnbaum-Saunders
		as the distribution for the frailty terms. For the basal model,
		it is considered a parametric approach based on the Weibull and
		the piecewise exponential distributions and a semiparametric
		approach. For details, see Gallardo and Bourguignon (2022)
		arXiv:2206.12973.
