		Estimation and Additional Tools for Alternative Shared Frailty
		Models // Provide estimation and data generation tools for some
		new multivariate frailty models. This version includes the
		gamma, inverse Gaussian, weighted Lindley, Birnbaum-Saunders,
		truncated normal, mixture of inverse Gaussian, mixture of
		Birnbaum-Saunders and generalized exponential as the
		distribution for the frailty terms. For the basal model, it is
		considered a parametric approach based on the exponential,
		Weibull and the piecewise exponential distributions as well as
		a semiparametric approach. For details, see Gallardo and
		Bourguignon (2025) doi:10.1002/bimj.70044 and Gallardo et al.
