		Nonparametric Simulation of RNA-Seq Data // RNA sequencing
		analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical
		parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be
		precisely satisfied in practice. Methods are often tested by
		analyzing data that have been simulated according to the
		assumed model. This testing strategy can result in an overly
		optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis
		method. We develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-
		seq data. The vector of read counts simulated for a given
		experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches
		the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the
		user. Users control the proportion of genes simulated to be
		differentially expressed (DE) and can provide a vector of
		weights to control the distribution of effect sizes. The
		algorithm requires a matrix of RNA-seq read counts with large
		sample sizes in at least two treatment groups. Many datasets
		are available that fit this standard.
