		An R Package for Generalized and Classical Blockmodeling of
		Valued Networks // This is primarily meant as an implementation
		of Generalized blockmodeling for valued networks. In addition,
		measures of similarity or dissimilarity based on structural
		equivalence and regular equivalence (REGE algorithm) can be
		computed and partitioned matrices can be plotted. This is a
		CRAN version. A newer version is available on R-forge, which
		for however lacks help files.
