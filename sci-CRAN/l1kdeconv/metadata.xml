		Deconvolution for LINCS L1000 Data // LINCS L1000 is a high-
		througphput technology that allows the gene expression
		measurement in a large number of assays. However, to fit the
		measurements of ~1000 genes in the ~500 color channels of LINCS
		L1000, every two landmark genes are designed to share a single
		channel. Thus, a deconvolution step is required to infer the
		expression values of each gene. Any errors in this step can be
		propagated adversely to the downstream analyses. We present a
		LINCS L1000 data peak calling R package l1kdeconv based on a
		new outlier detection method and an aggregate Gaussian mixture
		model (AGMM). Upon the remove of outliers and the borrowing
		information among similar samples, l1kdeconv shows more stable
		and better performance than methods commonly used in LINCS
		L1000 data deconvolution.
