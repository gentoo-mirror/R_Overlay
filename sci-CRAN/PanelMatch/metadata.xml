		Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time-Series Cross-
		Sectional Data // Implements a set of methodological tools that
		enable researchers to apply matching methods to time-series
		cross-sectional data. Imai, Kim, and Wang (2021)
		http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/tscs.pdf proposes a
		nonparametric generalization of the difference-in-differences
		estimator, which does not rely on the linearity assumption as
		often done in practice. Researchers first select a method of
		matching each treated observation for a given unit in a
		particular time period with control observations from other
		units in the same time period that have a similar treatment and
		covariate history. These methods include standard matching
		methods based on propensity score and Mahalanobis distance, as
		well as weighting methods. Once matching is done, both short-
		term and long-term average treatment effects for the treated
		can be estimated with standard errors. The package also offers
		a visualization technique that allows researchers to assess the
		quality of matches by examining the resulting covariate
		balance.
