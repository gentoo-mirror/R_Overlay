		Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time-Series Cross-
		Sectional Data // Implements a set of methodological tools that
		enable researchers to apply matching methods to time-series
		cross-sectional data. Imai, Kim, and Wang (2023)
		http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/tscs.pdf proposes a
		nonparametric generalization of the difference-in-differences
		estimator, which does not rely on the linearity assumption as
		often done in practice. Researchers first select a method of
		matching each treated observation for a given unit in a
		particular time period with control observations from other
		units in the same time period that have a similar treatment and
		covariate history. These methods include standard matching
		methods based on propensity score and Mahalanobis distance, as
		well as weighting methods. Once matching and refinement is
		done, treatment effects can be estimated with standard errors.
		The package also offers diagnostics for researchers to assess
		the quality of their results.
