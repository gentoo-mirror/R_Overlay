		Computation of Some Important Distributional Properties //
		Generally, most of the packages specify the probability density
		function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function,
		and random numbers generation of the probability distributions.
		The present package allows to compute some important
		distributional properties, including the first four ordinary
		and central moments, Pearson's coefficient of skewness and
		kurtosis, the mean and variance, coefficient of variation,
		median, and quartile deviation at some parametric values of
		several well-known and extensively used probability
		distributions.
