		Concurrent Multivariate Models with Time-Varying Coefficients //
		Provides a hypothesis test and variable selection algorithm for
		use in time-varying, concurrent regression models. The
		hypothesis test function is also accompanied by a plotting
		function which will show the estimated beta(s) and confidence
		band(s) from the hypothesis test. The hypothesis test function
		helps the user identify significant covariates within the scope
		of a time-varying concurrent model. The plots will show the
		amount of area that falls outside the confidence band(s) which
		is used for the test statistic within the hypothesis test.
