		Create Publication-Quality Plots // Contains several plotting
		functions such as barplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, as well as
		functions to combine plots and assist in the creation of these
		plots. These functions will give users great ease of use and
		customization options in broad use for biomedical applications,
		as well as general purpose plotting. Each of the functions also
		provides valid default settings to make plotting data more
		efficient and producing high quality plots with standard colour
		schemes simpler. All functions within this package are capable
		of producing plots that are of the quality to be presented in
		scientific publications and journals.
