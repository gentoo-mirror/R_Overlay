		Functions to Create Publication-Quality Plots // Contains several
		plotting functions such as barplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, as
		well as functions to combine plots and assist in the creation
		of these plots. These functions will give users great ease of
		use and customization options in broad use for biomedical
		applications, as well as general purpose plotting. Each of the
		functions also provides valid default settings to make plotting
		data more efficient and producing high quality plots with
		standard colour schemes simpler. All functions within this
		package are capable of producing plots that are of the quality
		to be presented in scientific publications and journals. P'ng
