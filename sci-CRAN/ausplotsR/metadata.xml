		TERN AusPlots Analysis Package // Extraction, preparation,
		visualisation and analysis of TERN AusPlots ecosystem
		monitoring data. Direct access to plot-based data on vegetation
		and soils across Australia, including physical sample barcode
		numbers. Simple function calls extract the data and merge them
		into species occurrence matrices for downstream analysis, or
		calculate things like basal area and fractional cover. TERN
		AusPlots is a national field plot-based ecosystem surveillance
		monitoring method and dataset for Australia. The data have been
		collected across a national network of plots and transects by
		the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN -
		https://www.tern.org.au), an Australian Government NCRIS-
		enabled project, and its Ecosystem Surveillance platform
		(https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-
		surveillance/).
