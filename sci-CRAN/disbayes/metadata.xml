		Bayesian Multi-State Modelling of Chronic Disease Burden Data //
		Estimation of incidence and case fatality for a chronic
		disease, given partial information, using a multi-state model.
		Given data on age-specific mortality and either incidence or
		prevalence, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the
		posterior distributions of incidence, case fatality, and
		functions of these such as prevalence.  The methods are
		described in Jackson et al. (2021) arXiv:2111.14100.
