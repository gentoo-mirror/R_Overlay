		Ecological Metadata as Linked Data // This is a utility for
		transforming Ecological Metadata Language ('EML') files into
		'JSON-LD' and back into 'EML.'  Doing so creates a list-based
		representation of 'EML' in R, so that 'EML' data can easily be
		manipulated using standard 'R' tools. This makes this package
		an effective backend for other 'R'-based tools  working with
		'EML.' By abstracting away the complexity of 'XML' Schema,
		developers can build around native 'R' list objects and not
		have to worry about satisfying many of the additional
		constraints of set by the schema (such as element ordering,
		which is handled automatically). Additionally, the 'JSON-LD'
		representation enables the use of developer-friendly 'JSON'
		parsing and serialization that may facilitate the use of 'EML'
		in contexts outside of 'R,' as well as the informatics-friendly
		serializations such as 'RDF' and 'SPARQL' queries.
