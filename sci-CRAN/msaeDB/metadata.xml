		Difference Benchmarking for Multivariate Small Area Estimation //
		Implements Benchmarking Method for Multivariate Small Area
		Estimation under Fay Herriot Model. Multivariate Small Area
		Estimation (MSAE) is a development of Univariate Small Area
		Estimation that considering the correlation among response
		variables and borrowing the strength from related areas and
		auxiliary variables to increase the effectiveness of sample
		size, the multivariate model in this package is based on
		multivariate model 1 proposed by Roberto Benavent and Domingo
		Morales (2016) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2015.07.013. Benchmarking in
		Small Area Estimation is a modification of Small Area
		Estimation model to guarantee that the aggregate weighted mean
		of the county predictors equals the corresponding weighted mean
		of survey estimates. Difference Benchmarking is the simplest
		benchmarking method but widely used by multiplying empirical
		best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimator by the common
		adjustment factors (J.N.K Rao and Isabel Molina, 2015).
