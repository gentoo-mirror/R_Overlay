		Difference Benchmarking for Multivariate Small Area Estimation //
		Implements Benchmarking Method for Multivariate Small Area
		Estimation under Fay Herriot Model. Multivariate Small Area
		Estimation (MSAE) is a development of Univariate Small Area
		Estimation that considering the correlation among response
		variables and borrowing the strength from auxiliary variables
		effectiveness of a domain sample size, the multivariate model
		in this package is based on multivariate model 1 proposed by
		Roberto Benavent and Domingo Morales (2015)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2015.07.013. Benchmarking in Small Area
		Estimation is a modification of Small Area Estimation model to
		guarantees that the aggregate weighted mean of the county
		predictors equals the corresponding weighted mean of survey
		estimates. Difference Benchmarking is the simplest benchmarking
		method but widely used by multiplying empirical best linear
		unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimator by the common adjustment
		factors (J.N.K Rao and Isabel Molina, 2013).
