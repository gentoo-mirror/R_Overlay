		Parametric Time Warping // Parametric Time Warping aligns
		patterns, i.e. it aims to put corresponding features at the
		same locations. The algorithm searches for an optimal
		polynomial describing the warping. It is possible to align one
		sample to a reference, several samples to the same reference,
		or several samples to several references. One can choose
		between calculating individual warpings, or one global warping
		for a set of samples and one reference. Two optimization
		criteria are implemented: RMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC
		(Weighted Cross Correlation). Both warping of peak profiles and
		of peak lists are supported. A vignette for the latter is
		contained in the inst/doc directory of the source package - the
		vignette source can be found on the package github site.
