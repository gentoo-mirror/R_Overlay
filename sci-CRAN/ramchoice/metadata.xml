		Revealed Preference and Attention Analysis in Random Limited
		Attention Models // It is widely documented in psychology,
		economics and other disciplines that socio-economic agent may
		not pay full attention to all available alternatives, rendering
		standard revealed preference theory invalid. This package
		implements the estimation and inference procedures of Cattaneo,
		Ma, Masatlioglu and Suleymanov (2020) arXiv:1712.03448 and
		Cattaneo, Cheung, Ma, and Masatlioglu (2021) arXiv:2110.10650,
		which utilizes standard choice data to partially identify and
		estimate a decision maker's preference and attention. For
		inference, several simulation-based critical values are
		provided.
