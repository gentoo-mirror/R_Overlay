		Estimation and Inference in Random Attention Models // It is
		widely documented in psychology, economics and other
		disciplines that socio-economic agent may not pay full
		attention to all available alternatives, rendering standard
		revealed preference theory invalid. This package implements the
		estimation and inference procedures documented in Cattaneo, Ma,
		Masatlioglu and Suleymanov (2019) arXiv:1712.03448, which
		utilizes standard choice data to partially identify and
		estimate a decision maker's preference. For inference, several
		simulation-based critical values are provided.
