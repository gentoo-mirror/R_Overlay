		Estimation and Inference in Random Attention Models // It is
		widely documented in psychology, economics and other
		disciplines that socio-economic agents do not pay full
		attention to all available choices, rendering standard revealed
		preference theory invalid. This package implements the
		estimation and inference procedures documented in Cattaneo, Ma,
		Masatlioglu and Suleymanov (2017) http://www-
		personal.umich.edu/~cattaneo/papers/Cattaneo-Ma-Masatlioglu-
		Suleymanov_2017_RAM.pdf, which utilizes standard choice data to
		partially identify and estimate decision maker's preference.
		For inference, different simulation-based critical values are
		provided.
