		Visualising How Nonlinear Dimension Reduction Warps Your Data //
		To construct a model in 2-D space from 2-D nonlinear dimension
		reduction data and then lift it to the high-dimensional space.
		Additionally, provides tools to visualise the model overlay the
		data in 2-D and high-dimensional space. Furthermore, provides
		summaries and diagnostics to evaluate the nonlinear dimension
		reduction layout.
