		Visualising How Nonlinear Dimension Reduction Warps Your Data //
		To construct a model in 2D space from 2D embedding data and
		then lift it to the high-dimensional space. Additionally, it
		provides tools to visualize the model in 2D space and to
		overlay the fitted model on data using the tour technique.
		Furthermore, it facilitates the generation of summaries of
		high-dimensional distributions.
