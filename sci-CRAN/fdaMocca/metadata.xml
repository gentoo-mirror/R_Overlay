		Model-Based Clustering for Functional Data with Covariates //
		Routines for model-based functional cluster analysis for
		functional data with optional covariates. The idea is to
		cluster functional subjects (often called functional objects)
		into homogenous groups by using spline smoothers (for
		functional data) together with scalar covariates. The spline
		coefficients and the covariates are modelled as a multivariate
		Gaussian mixture model, where the number of mixtures
		corresponds to the number of clusters. The parameters of the
		model are estimated by maximizing the observed mixture
		likelihood via an EM algorithm (Arnqvist and Sjstedt de Luna,
		2019) doi:10.48550/arXiv.1904.10265. The clustering method is
		used to analyze annual lake sediment from lake Kassjn (Northern
		Sweden) which cover more than 6400 years and can be seen as
		historical records of weather and climate.
