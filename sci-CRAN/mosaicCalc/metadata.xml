		Function-Based Numerical and Symbolic Differentiation and
		Antidifferentiation // Part of the Project MOSAIC (http
		://mosaic-web.org/) suite that provides utility functions for
		doing calculus (differentiation and integration) in R. The main
		differentiation and antidifferentiation operators are described
		using formulas and return functions rather than numerical
		values. Numerical values can be obtained by evaluating these
		functions.
