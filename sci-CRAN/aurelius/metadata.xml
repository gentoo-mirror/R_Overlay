		Generates PFA Documents from R Code and Optionally Runs Them //
		Provides tools for converting R objects and syntax into the
		Portable Format for Analytics (PFA). Allows for testing
		validity and runtime behavior of PFA documents through rPython
		and Titus, a more complete implementation of PFA for Python.
		The Portable Format for Analytics is a specification for event-
		based processors that perform predictive or analytic
		calculations and is aimed at helping smooth the transition from
		statistical model development to large-scale and/or online
		production. See http://dmg.org/pfa for more information.
