		Drift Correcting Water Quality Data // A tidy implementation of
		equations that correct for instrumental drift in continuous
		water quality monitoring data.  There are many sources of water
		quality data including private (ex: YSI instruments) and open
		source (ex: USGS and NDBC), each of which are susceptible to
		errors/inaccuracies due to drift. This package allows the user
		to correct their data using one or two standard reference
		values in a uniform, reproducible way. The equations
		implemented are from Hasenmueller (2011) doi:10.7936/K7N014KS.
