		Predict Dominant Direction of Reactions of a Biochemical Network
		// Biologically relevant, yet mathematically sound constraints
		are used to compute the propensity and thence infer the
		dominant direction of reactions of a generic biochemical
		network. The reactions must be unique and their number must
		exceed that of the reactants,i.e., reactions = reactants + 2.
		'ReDirection', computes the null space of a user-defined
		stoichiometry matrix. The spanning non-zero and unique reaction
		vectors (RVs) are combinatorially summed to generate one or
		more subspaces recursively. Every reaction is represented as a
		sequence of identical components across all RVs of a particular
		subspace. The terms are evaluated with (biologically relevant
		bounds, linear maps, tests of convergence, descriptive
		statistics, vector norms) and the terms are classified into
		forward-, reverse- and equivalent-subsets. Since, these are
		mutually exclusive the probability of occurrence is binary
		(all, 1; none, 0). The combined propensity of a reaction is the
		p1-norm of the sub-propensities, i.e., sum of the products of
		the probability and maximum numeric value of a subset (least
		upper bound, greatest lower bound). This, if strictly positive
		is the probable rate constant, is used to infer dominant
		direction and annotate a reaction as "Forward (f)", "Reverse
		(b)" or "Equivalent (e)". The inherent computational complexity
		(NP-hard) per iteration suggests that a suitable value for the
		number of reactions is around 20. Three functions comprise
		ReDirection. These are check_matrix() and reaction_vector()
		which are internal, and calculate_reaction_vector() which is
		external.
