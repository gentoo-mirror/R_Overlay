		Maximum Likelihood Analysis of Animal Movement Behavior Using
		Multivariate Hidden Markov Models // Extended tools for
		analyzing telemetry data using generalized hidden Markov
		models. Features of momentuHMM (pronounced ``momentum'')
		include data pre-processing and visualization, fitting HMMs to
		location and auxiliary biotelemetry or environmental data,
		biased and correlated random walk movement models, hierarchical
		HMMs, multiple imputation for incorporating location
		measurement error and missing data, user-specified design
		matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of parameters,
		random effects, decoding of the state process, visualization of
		fitted models, model checking and selection, and simulation.
