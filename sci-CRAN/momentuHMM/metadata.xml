		Maximum Likelihood Analysis of Animal Movement Behavior Using
		Multivariate Hidden Markov Models // Extended tools for
		analyzing telemetry data using generalized hidden Markov
		models. These include data pre-processing and visualization,
		fitting HMMs to location and auxiliary biotelemetry or
		environmental data, biased and correlated random walk movement
		models, multiple imputation for incorporating location
		measurement error and missing data, user-specified design
		matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of parameters,
		decoding of the state process, visualization of fitted models,
		model checking and selection, and simulation. See McClintock
		and Michelot (2017) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12995.
