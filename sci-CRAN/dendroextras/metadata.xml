		Extra Functions to Cut, Label and Colour Dendrogram Clusters //
		Provides extra functions to manipulate dendrograms that build
		on the base functions provided by the 'stats' package. The main
		functionality it is designed to add is the ability to colour
		all the edges in an object of class 'dendrogram' according to
		cluster membership i.e. each subtree is coloured, not just the
		terminal leaves. In addition it provides some utility functions
		to cut 'dendrogram' and 'hclust' objects and to set/get labels.
