		Quantitative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data // A complete
		analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other two-
		dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly
		used plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive
		features, namely baseline subtraction methods such as
		morphological filters (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive non-
		linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak alignment
		using warping functions, handling of replicated measurements as
		well as allowing spectra with different resolutions.
