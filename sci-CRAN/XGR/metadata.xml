		Exploring Genomic Relations for Enhanced Interpretation Through
		Enrichment, Similarity, Network and Annotation Analysis // The
		central goal of XGR by Fang et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1186/s13073-016-0384-y is to provide a data
		interpretation system necessary to do "big data" science. It is
		designed to make a user-defined gene or SNP list (or genomic
		regions) more interpretable by comprehensively utilising
		ontology annotations and interaction networks to reveal
		relationships and enhance opportunities for biological
		discovery. XGR is unique in supporting a broad range of
		ontologies (including knowledge of biological and molecular
		functions, pathways, diseases and phenotypes - in both human
		and mouse) and different types of networks (including
		functional, physical and pathway interactions). There are two
		core functionalities of XGR. The first is to provide basic
		infrastructures for easy access to built-in ontologies and
		networks. The second is to support data interpretations via 1)
		enrichment analysis using either built-in or custom ontologies,
		2) similarity analysis for calculating semantic similarity
		between genes (or SNPs) based on their ontology annotation
		profiles, 3) network analysis for identification of gene
		networks given a query list of (significant) genes, SNPs or
		genomic regions, and 4) annotation analysis for interpreting
		genomic regions using co-localised functional genomic
		annotations (such as open chromatin, epigenetic marks, TF
		binding sites and genomic segments) and using nearby gene
		annotations (by ontologies). Together with its web app, XGR
		aims to provide a user-friendly tool for exploring genomic
		relations at the gene, SNP and genomic region level.
