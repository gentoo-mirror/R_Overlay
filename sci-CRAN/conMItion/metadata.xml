		Conditional Mutual Information Estimation for Multi-Omics Data //
		The biases introduced in association measures, particularly
		mutual information, are influenced by factors such as tumor
		purity, mutation burden, and hypermethylation. This package
		provides the estimation of conditional mutual information (CMI)
		and its statistical significance with a focus on its
		application to multi-omics data. Utilizing B-spline functions
		(inspired by Daub et al. (2004) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-5-118),
		the package offers tools to estimate the association between
		heterogeneous multi- omics data, while removing the effects of
		confounding factors. This helps to unravel complex biological
		interactions. In addition, it includes methods to evaluate the
		statistical significance of these associations, providing a
		robust framework for multi-omics data integration and analysis.
		This package is ideal for researchers in computational biology,
		bioinformatics, and systems biology seeking a comprehensive
		tool for understanding interdependencies in omics data.
