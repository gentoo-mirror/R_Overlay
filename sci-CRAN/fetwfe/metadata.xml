		Fused Extended Two-Way Fixed Effects // Calculates the fused
		extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE) estimator for unbiased
		and efficient estimation of difference-in-differences in panel
		data with staggered treatment adoption. This estimator
		eliminates bias inherent in conventional two-way fixed effects
		estimators, while also employing a novel bridge regression
		regularization approach to improve efficiency and yield valid
		standard errors. Also implements extended TWFE (etwfe) and
		bridge-penalized ETWFE (betwfe). Provides S3 classes for
		streamlined workflow and supports flexible tuning (ridge and
		rank-condition guarantees), automatic covariate
		centering/scaling, and detailed overall and cohort-specific
		effect estimates with valid standard errors. Includes
		simulation and formatting utilities, extensive diagnostic
		tools, vignettes, and examples. See Faletto (2025)
		(doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.05985).
