		Fused Extended Two-Way Fixed Effects // Calculates the fused
		extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE) estimator for unbiased
		and efficient estimation of difference-in-differences in panel
		data with staggered treatment adoption. This estimator
		eliminates bias inherent in conventional two-way fixed effects
		estimators, while also employing a novel bridge regression
		regularization approach to improve efficiency and yield valid
		standard errors. Provides flexible tuning parameters (including
		user-specified or data-driven choices for penalty parameters),
		detailed output including overall and cohort-specific treatment
		effects with confidence intervals, and extensive diagnostic
		tools. See details in Faletto (2024)
		(doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.05985).
