		Data Structures, Summaries, and Visualisations for Missing Data
		// Missing values are ubiquitous in data and need to be
		explored and handled in the initial stages of analysis.
		'naniar' provides data structures and functions that facilitate
		the plotting of missing values and examination of imputations.
		This allows missing data dependencies to be explored with
		minimal deviation from the common work patterns of 'ggplot2'
		and tidy data. The work is fully discussed at Tierney  Cook
		(2018) arXiv:1809.02264.
