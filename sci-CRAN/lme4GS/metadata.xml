		'lme4' for Genomic Selection // Flexible functions that use
		'lme4' as computational engine for fitting models used in
		Genomic Selection (GS). GS is a technology used for genetic
		improvement, and it has many advantages over phenotype-based
		selection. There are several statistical models that adequately
		approach the statistical challenges in GS, such as in linear
		mixed models (LMMs). The 'lme4' is the standard package for
		fitting linear and generalized LMMs in the R-package, but its
		use for genetic analysis is limited because it does not allow
		the correlation between individuals or groups of individuals to
		be defined. The 'lme4GS' package is focused on fitting LMMs
		with covariance structures defined by the user, bandwidth
		selection, and genomic prediction. The new package is focused
		on genomic prediction of the models used in GS and can fit LMMs
		using different variance-covariance matrices. Several examples
		of GS models are presented using this package as well as the
		analysis using real data. For more details see Caamal-Pat
		et.al. (2021) doi:10.3389/fgene.2021.680569.
