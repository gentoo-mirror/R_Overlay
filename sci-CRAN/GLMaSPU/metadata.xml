		An Adaptive Test on High Dimensional Parameters in Generalized
		Linear Models // Several tests for high dimensional generalized
		linear models have been proposed recently. In this package, we
		implemented a new test called adaptive  sum of powered score
		(aSPU) for high dimensional generalized linear models, which is
		often more powerful than the existing methods in a wide
		scenarios. We also implemented permutation based version of
		several existing methods for research purpose. We recommend
		users use the aSPU test for their real testing problem. You can
		learn more about the tests implemented in the package via the
		following papers: 1. Pan, W., Kim, J., Zhang, Y., Shen, X. and
		Wei, P. (2014) DOI:10.1534/genetics.114.165035 A powerful and
		adaptive association test for rare variants, Genetics, 197(4).
