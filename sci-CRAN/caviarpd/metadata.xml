		Cluster Analysis via Random Partition Distributions // Cluster
		analysis is performed using pairwise distance information and a
		random partition distribution. The method is implemented for
		two random partition distributions. It draws samples and then
		obtains and plots clustering estimates. An implementation of a
		selection algorithm is provided for the mass parameter of the
		partition distribution. Since pairwise distances are the
		principal input to this procedure, it is most comparable to the
		hierarchical and k-medoids clustering methods. The method is
		currently under peer review at a journal.
