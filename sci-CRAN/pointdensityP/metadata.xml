		Point Density for Geospatial Data // The function pointdensity
		returns a density count and the temporal average for every
		point in the original list. The dataframe returned includes
		four columns: lat, lon, count, and date_avg. The "lat" column
		is the original latitude data; the "lon" column is the original
		longitude data; the "count" is the density count of the number
		of points within a radius of radius*grid_size (the
		neighborhood); and the date_avg column includes the average
		date of each point in the neighborhood.
