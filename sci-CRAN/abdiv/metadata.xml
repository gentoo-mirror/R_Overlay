		Alpha and Beta Diversity Measures // A collection of measures for
		measuring ecological diversity. Ecological diversity comes in
		two flavors: alpha diversity measures the diversity within a
		single site or sample, and beta diversity measures the
		diversity across two sites or samples. This package overlaps
		considerably with other R packages such as 'vegan', 'gUniFrac',
		'betapart', and 'fossil'. We also include a wide range of
		functions that are implemented in software outside the R
		ecosystem, such as 'scipy', 'Mothur', and 'scikit-bio'.  The
		implementations here are designed to be basic and clear to the
		reader.
