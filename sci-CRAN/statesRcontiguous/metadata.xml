		Shapefiles for the Contiguous United States of America // Data
		package containing shapefiles for the US that may easily be
		restricted to only the contiguous US. Shapefiles are provided
		for; states, congressional districts and counties. All
		shapefiles have the resolution of 1:20,000,000 and are from the
		US Census Bureau - https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data
		/tiger-cart-boundary.html. State/County/District information
		has been combined from multiple disjoint Census shapefile
		products in this package, see the 'shapefile_details' tibble
		for details. Please note, this package is explicitly designed
		to fit all shapefiles within one CRAN-hosted package. You will
		want to use the 'tigris' package for programmatic access to the
		US Census' shapefile products.
