		Implementation of the 'Lights Out' Puzzle Game // Lights Out is a
		puzzle game consisting of a grid of lights that are either on
		or off. Pressing any light will toggle it and its adjacent
		lights. The goal of the game is to switch all the lights off.
		This package provides an interface to play the game on
		different board sizes, both through the command line or with a
		visual application. Puzzles can also be solved using the
		automatic solver included. View a demo online at
