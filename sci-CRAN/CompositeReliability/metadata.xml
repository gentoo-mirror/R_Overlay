		Determine the Composite Reliability of a Naturalistic, Unbalanced
		Dataset // The reliability of assessment tools is a crucial
		aspect of monitoring student performance in various educational
		settings. It ensures that the assessment outcomes accurately
		reflect a student's true level of performance. However, when
		assessments are combined, determining composite reliability can
		be challenging, especially for naturalistic and unbalanced
		datasets. This package provides an easy-to-use solution for
		calculating composite reliability for different assessment
		types. It allows for the inclusion of weight per assessment
		type and produces extensive G- and D-study results with
		graphical interpretations. Overall, our approach enhances the
		reliability of composite assessments, making it suitable for
		various education contexts.
