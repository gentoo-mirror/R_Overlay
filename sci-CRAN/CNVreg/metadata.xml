		CNV-Profile Regression for Copy Number Variants Association
		Analysis with Penalized Regression // Performs copy number
		variants association analysis with Lasso and Weighted Fusion
		penalized regression. Creates a "CNV profile curve" to
		represent an individuals CNV events across a genomic region so
		to capture variations in CNV length and dosage. When evaluating
		association, the CNV profile curve is directly used as a
		predictor in the regression model, avoiding the need to
		predefine CNV loci. CNV profile regression estimates CNV
		effects at each genome position, making the results comparable
		across different studies. The penalization encourages sparsity
		in variable selection with a Lasso penalty and encourages
		effect smoothness between consecutive CNV events with a
		weighted fusion penalty, where the weight controls the level of
		smoothing between adjacent CNVs. For more details, see Si
