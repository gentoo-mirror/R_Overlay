		Tools for Imaging Flow Cytometry // Contains several tools to
		treat imaging flow cytometry data from 'ImageStream' and
		'FlowSight' cytometers ('Amnis' 'Cytek'). Provides an easy and
		simple way to read and write .fcs, .rif, .cif and .daf files.
		Information such as masks, features, regions and populations
		set within these files can be retrieved for each single cell.
		In addition, raw data such as images stored can also be
		accessed. Users, may hopefully increase their productivity
		thanks to dedicated functions to extract, visualize, manipulate
		and export 'IFC' data. Toy data example can be installed
		through the 'IFCdata' package of approximately 32 MB, which is
		available in a 'drat' repository
		https://gitdemont.github.io/IFCdata/. See file 'COPYRIGHTS' and
		file 'AUTHORS' for a list of copyright holders and authors.
