		Meta-Analyses for Simultaneously Estimating Individual Means //
		Implement meta-analyses for simultaneously estimating
		individual means with shrinkage, isotonic regression and
		pretests. Include our original implementation of the isotonic
		regression via the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA)
		algorithm. For the pretest estimator, the confidence interval
		for individual means are provided. Methodologies were published
		in Taketomi et al. (2021) doi:10.3390/axioms10040267, Taketomi
		et al. (2022) doi:10.3390/a15010026, Taketomi et al. (2023-)
		(under review).
