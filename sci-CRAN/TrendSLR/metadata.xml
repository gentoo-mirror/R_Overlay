		Estimating Trend, Velocity and Acceleration from Sea Level
		Records // Analysis of annual average ocean water level time
		series, providing improved estimates of trend (mean sea level)
		and associated real-time velocities and accelerations. Improved
		trend estimates are based on singular spectrum analysis
		methods. Various gap-filling options are included to
		accommodate incomplete time series records. The package also
		includes a range of diagnostic tools to inspect the components
		comprising the original time series which enables expert
		interpretation and selection of likely trend components. A wide
		range of screen and plot to file options are available in the
		package.
