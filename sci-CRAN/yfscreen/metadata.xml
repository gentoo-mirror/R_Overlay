		Yahoo Finance 'screener' API // Simple and efficient access to
		Yahoo Finance's 'screener' API
		https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/ for querying
		and retrieval of financial data. The core functionality
		abstracts the complexities of interacting with Yahoo Finance
		APIs, such as session management, crumb and cookie handling,
		query construction, pagination, and JSON payload generation.
		This abstraction allows users to focus on filtering and
		retrieving data rather than managing API details. Use cases
		include screening across a range of security types including
		equities, mutual funds, ETFs, indices, and futures. The package
		supports advanced query capabilities, including logical
		operators, nested filters, and customizable payloads. It
		automatically handles pagination to ensure efficient retrieval
		of large datasets by fetching results in batches of up to 250
		entries per request. Filters can be dynamically defined to
		accommodate a wide range of screening needs. The implementation
		leverages standard HTTP libraries to handle API interactions
		efficiently and provides support for both R and Python to
		ensure accessibility for a broad audience.
