		Tools for Analyzing Mixed Effect Regression Models // Provides
		methods for extracting results from mixed-effect model objects
		fit with the 'lme4' package. Allows construction of prediction
		intervals efficiently from large scale linear and generalized
		linear mixed-effects models. This method draws from the
		simulation framework used in the Gelman and Hill (2007)
		textbook: Data Analysis Using Regression and
		Multilevel/Hierarchical Models.
