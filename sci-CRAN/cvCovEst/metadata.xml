		Cross-Validated Covariance Matrix Estimation // An efficient
		cross-validated approach for covariance matrix estimation,
		particularly useful in high-dimensional settings. This method
		relies upon the theory of loss-based estimator selection to
		identify the optimal estimator of the covariance matrix from
		among a prespecified set of candidate.
