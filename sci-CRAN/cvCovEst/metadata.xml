		Cross-Validated Covariance Matrix Estimation // An efficient
		cross-validated approach for covariance matrix estimation,
		particularly useful in high-dimensional settings. This method
		relies upon the theory of high-dimensional loss-based
		covariance matrix estimator selection developed by Boileau et
		al. (2022) doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2110883 to identify the
		optimal estimator from among a prespecified set of candidates.
