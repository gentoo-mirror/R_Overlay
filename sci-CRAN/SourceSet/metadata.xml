		A Graphical Model Approach to Identify Primary Genes in Perturbed
		Biological Pathways // The algorithm pursues the identification
		of the set of variables driving the differences in two
		different experimental conditions (i.e., the primary genes)
		within a graphical model context. It uses the idea of
		simultaneously looking for the differences between two
		multivariate normal distributions in all marginal and
		conditional distributions associated with a decomposable graph,
		which represents the pathway under exam. The implementation
		accommodates genomics specific issues (low sample size and
		multiple testing issues) and provides a number of functions
		offering numerical and visual summaries to help the user
		interpret the obtained results. In order to use the (optional)
		'Cytoscape' functionalities, the suggested 'r2cytoscape'
		package must be installed from the 'GitHub' repository
		('devtools::install_github('cytoscape/r2cytoscape')').
