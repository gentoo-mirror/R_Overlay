		Parallel Distance Matrix Computation using Multiple Threads // A
		fast parallelized alternative to R's native 'dist' function to
		calculate distance matrices for continuous, binary, and multi-
		dimensional input matrices, which supports a broad variety of
		41 predefined distance functions from the 'stats', 'proxy' and
		'dtw' R packages, as well as user- defined functions written in
		C++. For ease of use, the 'parDist' function extends the
		signature of the 'dist' function and uses the same parameter
		naming conventions as distance methods of existing R packages.
		The package is mainly implemented in C++ and leverages the
		'RcppParallel' package to parallelize the distance computations
		with the help of the 'TinyThread' library. Furthermore, the
		'Armadillo' linear algebra library is used for optimized matrix
		operations during distance calculations. The curiously
		recurring template pattern (CRTP) technique is applied to avoid
		virtual functions, which improves the Dynamic Time Warping
		calculations while the implementation stays flexible enough to
		support different DTW step patterns and normalization methods.
