		Bayesian Inference for Neyman-Scott Point Processes // The
		Bayesian MCMC estimation of parameters for Thomas-type cluster
		point process with various inhomogeneities. It allows for
		inhomogeneity in (i) distribution of parent points, (ii) mean
		number of points in a cluster, (iii) cluster spread. The
		package also allows for the Bayesian MCMC algorithm for the
		homogeneous generalized Thomas process. The cluster size is
		allowed to have a variance that is greater or less than the
		expected value (cluster sizes are over or under dispersed).
		Details are described in Dvok, Reme, Bernek  Mrkvika (2022)
		arXiv: 10.48550/arXiv.2205.07946.
