		Uncertainty of Time Series Model Selection Methods // We propose
		a new procedure, called model uncertainty variance, which can
		quantify the uncertainty of model selection on Autoregressive
		Moving Average models. The model uncertainty variance not pay
		attention to the accuracy of prediction, but focus on model
		selection uncertainty and providing more information of the
		model selection results. And to estimate the model measures, we
		propose an simplify and faster algorithm based on bootstrap
		method, which is proven to be effective and feasible by Monte-
		Carlo simulation. At the same time, we also made some
		optimizations and adjustments to the Model Confidence Bounds
		algorithm, so that it can be applied to the time series model
		selection method. The consistency of the algorithm result is
		also verified by Monte-Carlo simulation. We propose a new
