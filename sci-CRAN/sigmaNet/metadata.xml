		Render Graphs Using 'Sigma.js' // Create interactive graph
		visualizations using 'Sigma.js' http://sigmajs.org/.  This
		package is meant to be used in conjunction with 'igraph',
		replacing the (somewhat underwhelming) plotting features of the
		package.  The idea is to quickly render graphs, regardless of
		their size, in a way that allows for easy, iterative
		modification of aesthetics.  Because 'Sigma.js' is a
		'javascript' library, the visualizations are inherently
		interactive and are well suited for integration with 'Shiny'
		apps.  While there are several 'htmlwidgets' focused on network
		visualization, they tend to underperform on medium to large
		sized graphs.  'Sigma.js' was designed for larger network
		visualizations and this package aims to make those strengths
		available to 'R' users.
