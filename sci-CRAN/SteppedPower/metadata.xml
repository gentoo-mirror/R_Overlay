		Power Calculation for Stepped Wedge Designs // Tools for power
		and sample size calculation as well as design diagnostics for
		longitudinal mixed model settings, with a focus on stepped
		wedge designs. All calculations are oracle estimates i.e.
		assume random effect variances to be known (or guessed) in
		advance. The method is introduced in Hussey and Hughes (2007)
		doi:10.1016/j.cct.2006.05.007, extensions are discussed in Li
