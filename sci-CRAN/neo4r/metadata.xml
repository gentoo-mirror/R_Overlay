		A 'Neo4J' Driver // A Modern and Flexible 'Neo4J' Driver,
		allowing you to query data on a 'Neo4J' server and handle the
		results in R. It's modern in the sense it provides a driver
		that can be easily integrated in a data analysis workflow,
		especially by providing an API working smoothly with other data
		analysis and graph packages. It's flexible in the  way it
		returns the results, by trying to stay as close as possible to
		the way 'Neo4J' returns data. That way, you have the control
		over the way you will compute the results. At the same time,
		the result is not too complex, so that the "heavy lifting" of
		data wrangling is not left to the user.
