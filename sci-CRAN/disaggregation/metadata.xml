		Disaggregation Modelling // Fits disaggregation regression models
		using 'TMB' ('Template Model Builder'). When the response data
		are aggregated to polygon level but the predictor variables are
		at a higher resolution, these models can be useful. Regression
		models with spatial random fields. A useful reference for
		disaggregation modelling is Lucas et al. (2019)
