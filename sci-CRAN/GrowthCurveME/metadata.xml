		Mixed-Effects Modeling for Growth Data // Simple and  user-
		friendly wrappers to the 'saemix' package for performing linear
		and non-linear mixed-effects regression modeling for growth
		data to account for clustering or longitudinal analysis via
		repeated measurements. The package allows users to fit a
		variety of growth models, including linear, exponential,
		logistic, and 'Gompertz' functions. For non-linear models,
		starting values are automatically calculated using initial
		least-squares estimates. The package includes functions for
		summarizing models, visualizing data and results, calculating
		doubling time and other key statistics, and generating model
		diagnostic plots and residual summary statistics. It also
		provides functions for generating publication-ready summary
		tables for reports. Additionally, users can fit linear and non-
		linear least-squares regression models if clustering is not
		applicable. The mixed-effects modeling methods in this package
		are based on Comets, Lavenu, and Lavielle (2017)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v080.i03 as implemented in the 'saemix'
		package. Please contact us at models@dfci.harvard.edu with any
		questions.
