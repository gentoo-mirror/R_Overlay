		Basic Pipe Hydraulics // Functions for basic hydraulic
		calculations related to water flow in circular pipes flowing
		full (under pressure). This includes friction loss calculations
		by solving the Darcy-Weisbach equation for head loss, flow or
		diameter, and plotting a Moody diagram. The Darcy-Weisbach
		friction factor is calculated using the Colebrook (or
		Colebrook-White equation), the basis of the Moody diagram, the
		original citation being Colebrook (1939)
		doi:10.1680/ijoti.1939.13150. The derivation of the Darcy-
		Weisbach equation and methods for its solution are outlined in
		many fluid mechanics texts such as Finnemore and Franzini
		(2002, ISBN:978-0072432022). This package is designed to work
		similarly to the 'iemisc' package, but with an emphasis on pipe
		flow.
