		Bayesian Statistical Process Monitoring // The R-package bayespm
		implements Bayesian Statistical Process Control and Monitoring
		(SPC/M) methodology. These methods utilize available prior
		information and/or historical data, providing efficient online
		quality monitoring of a process, in terms of identifying
		moderate/large transient shifts (i.e., outliers) or persistent
		shifts of medium/small size in the process. These self-
		starting, sequentially updated tools can also run under
		complete absence of any prior information. The Predictive
		Control Charts (PCC) are introduced for the quality monitoring
		of data from any discrete or continuous distribution that is a
		member of the regular exponential family. The Predictive Ratio
		CUSUMs (PRC) are introduced for the Binomial, Poisson and
		Normal data (a later version of the library will cover all the
		remaining distributions from the regular exponential family).
		The PCC targets transient process shifts of typically large
		size (a.k.a. outliers), while PRC is focused in detecting
		persistent (structural) shifts that might be of medium or even
		small size. Apart from monitoring, both PCC and PRC provide the
		sequentially updated posterior inference for the monitored
		parameter. Bourazas K., Kiagias D. and Tsiamyrtzis P. (2022)
