		Bayesian Statistical Process Monitoring // The methods utilize
		available prior information and/or historical data, providing
		efficient online quality monitoring of a process, in terms of
		identifying moderate/large transient shifts (i.e., outliers) in
		the process. These self-starting, sequentially updated tools
		can also run under complete absence of any prior information.
		The Predictive Control Chart (PCC) mechanism is introduced for
		the quality monitoring of data from any discrete or continuous
		distribution that is a member of the regular exponential
		family. Apart from monitoring, PCC allows also to derive
		sequentially updated posterior inference for the monitored
		parameter. Bourazas K., Kiagias D. and Tsiamyrtzis P. (2022)

		monitoring of short runs" doi:10.1080/00224065.2021.1916413.
