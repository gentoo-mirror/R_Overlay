		Creating Echarts Visualizations as Easy as Possible // Create
		beautiful and interactive visualizations in a single function
		call. The 'data.table' package is utilized to perform the data
		wrangling necessary to prepare your data for the plot types you
		wish to build, along with allowing fast processing for big
		data. There are two broad classes of plots available: standard
		plots and machine learning evaluation plots. There are lots of
		parameters available in each plot type function for customizing
		the plots (such as faceting) and data wrangling (such as
		variable transformations and aggregation).
