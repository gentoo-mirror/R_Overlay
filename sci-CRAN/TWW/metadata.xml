		Growth Models // A model for the growth of self-limiting
		populations using three, four, or five parameter functions,
		which have wide applications in a variety of fields. The
		dependent variable in a dynamical modeling could be the
		population size at time x, where x is the independent variable.
		In the analysis of quantitative polymerase chain reaction
		(qPCR), the dependent variable would be the fluorescence
		intensity and the independent variable the cycle number. This
		package then would calculate the TWW cycle threshold.
