		Neural Network for Complex Survey Data // The goal of
		'surveynnet' is to extend the functionality of 'nnet', which
		already supports survey weights, by enabling it to handle
		clustered and stratified data. It achieves this by
		incorporating design effects through the use of effective
		sample sizes as outlined by Chen and Rust (2017),
		doi:10.1093/jssam/smw036, and performed by 'deffCR' in the
		package 'PracTools' (Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter (2018),
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-93632-1).
