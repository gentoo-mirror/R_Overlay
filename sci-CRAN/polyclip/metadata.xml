		Polygon Clipping // R port of Angus Johnson's open source library
		'Clipper'. Performs polygon clipping operations (intersection,
		union, set minus, set difference) for polygonal regions of
		arbitrary complexity, including holes. Computes offset polygons
		(spatial buffer zones, morphological dilations, Minkowski
		dilations) for polygonal regions and polygonal lines. Computes
		Minkowski Sum of general polygons. There is a function for
		removing self-intersections from polygon data.
