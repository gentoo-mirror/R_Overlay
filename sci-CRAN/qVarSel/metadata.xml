		Select Variables for Optimal Clustering // Finding hidden
		clusters in structured data can be hindered by the presence of
		masking variables. If not detected, masking variables are used
		to calculate the overall similarities between units, and
		therefore the cluster attribution is more imprecise. The
		algorithm q-vars implements an optimization method to find the
		variables that most separate units between clusters. In this
		way, masking variables can be discarded from the data frame and
		the clustering is more accurate. Tests can be found in Benati
		et al.(2017) doi:10.1080/01605682.2017.1398206.
