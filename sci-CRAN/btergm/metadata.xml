		Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models by Bootstrapped
		Pseudolikelihood // Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models
		(TERGM) estimated by maximum pseudolikelihood with bootstrapped
		confidence intervals or Markov Chain Monte Carlo maximum
		likelihood. Goodness of fit assessment for ERGMs, TERGMs, and
		SAOMs. Micro-level interpretation of ERGMs and TERGMs. The
		methods are described in Leifeld, Cranmer and Desmarais (2018),
		JStatSoft doi:10.18637/jss.v083.i06. If the suggested speedglm
		cannot be found on CRAN, you can find an old version in the
		GitHub mirror of CRAN at https://github.com/cran/speedglm.
