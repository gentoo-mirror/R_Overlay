		Marginal Modeling for Exposure Data with Values Below the LOD //
		Functions of marginal mean and quantile regression models are
		used to analyze environmental exposure and biomonitoring data
		with repeated measurements and non-detects (i.e., values below
		the limit of detection (LOD)), as well as longitudinal exposure
		data that include non-detects and time-dependent covariates.
