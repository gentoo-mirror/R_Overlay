		Tools for Case 1 Best-Worst Scaling // Provides basic functions
		that support an implementation of object case (Case 1) best-
		worst scaling: a function for converting a two-level orthogonal
		main-effect design/balanced incomplete block design into
		questions; two functions for creating a data set suitable for
		analysis; a function for calculating count-based scores; a
		function for calculating shares of preference; and a function
		for generating artificial responses to questions. For details
		on best-worst scaling, see Louviere et al. (2015)
