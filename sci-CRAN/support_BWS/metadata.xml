		Tools for Case 1 Best-Worst Scaling // Provides three basic
		functions that support an implementation of object case (Case
		1) best-worst scaling: one for converting a two-level
		orthogonal main-effect design/balanced incomplete block design
		into questions; one for creating a data set suitable for
		analysis; and one for calculating count-based scores. For
		details on best-worst scaling, see Louviere et al. (2015)
