		Basic Functions for Supporting an Implementation of Best-Worst
		Scaling // Provides three basic functions that support an
		implementation of object case (Case 1) best-worst scaling: one
		for converting a two-level orthogonal main-effect
		design/balanced incomplete block design into questions; one for
		creating a data set suitable for analysis; and one for
		calculating count-based scores.
