		Directed Acyclic Graph HMM with TAN Structured Emissions //
		Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a formal foundation for making
		probabilistic models of linear sequence. They provide a
		conceptual toolkit for building complex models just by drawing
		an intuitive picture. They are at the heart of a diverse range
		of programs, including genefinding, profile searches, multiple
		sequence alignment and regulatory site identification. HMMs are
		the Legos of computational sequence analysis. In graph theory,
		a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are
		connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected
		acyclic undirected graph. Tree represents the nodes connected
		by edges. It is a non-linear data structure. A poly-tree is
		simply a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected
		graph is a tree. The model proposed in this package is the same
		as an HMM but where the states are linked via a polytree
		structure rather than a simple path.
