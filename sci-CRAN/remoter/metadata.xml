		Remote R: Control a Remote R Session from a Local One // A set of
		utilities for client/server computing with R, controlling a
		remote R session (the server) from a local one (the client).
		Simply set up a server (see package vignette for more details)
		and connect to it from your local R session ('RStudio',
		terminal, etc).  The client/server framework is a custom 'REPL'
		and runs entirely in your R session without the need for
		installing a custom environment on your system.  Network
		communication is handled by the 'ZeroMQ' library by way of the
		'pbdZMQ' package.
