		Remote R: Control a Remote R Session from a Local One // A set of
		utilities for controlling a remote R session from a local one.
		Simply set up a server (see package vignette for more details)
		and connect to it from your local R session, including
		'RStudio'.  Network communication is handled by the 'ZeroMQ'
		library by way of the 'pbdZMQ' package.  The client/server
		framework is a custom 'REPL'.
