		Analysis Framework for Monte Carlo Simulation Data in Physics //
		Toolkit to perform statistical analyses of correlation
		functions generated from Lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In
		particular, a class 'cf' for correlation functions and methods
		to analyse those are defined. This includes (blocked) bootstrap
		(based on the 'boot' package) and jackknife, but also an
		automatic determination of integrated autocorrelation times.
		'hadron' also provides a very  general function
		bootstrap.nlsfit() to bootstrap a non-linear least squares fit.
		More specific functions are provided to extract hadronic
		quantities from Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics simulations, a
		particular Monte Carlo simulation,(see e.g. European Twisted
		Mass Collaboration, P. Boucaud et al. (2008)
		doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2008.06.013). Here, to determine energy
		eigenvalues of hadronic states, specific fitting routines and
		in particular the generalised eigenvalue method (see e.g. B.
		Blossier et al. (2009) doi:10.1088/1126-6708/2009/04/094 and M.
		Fischer et al. (2020)
		https://inspirehep.net/literature/1792113) are implemented. In
		addition, input/output and plotting routines are available.
