		Data Analyses in Agriculture and Biology // Contains several
		tools for nonlinear regression analyses and general data
		analysis in biology and agriculture. Contains also datasets for
		practicing and teaching purposes. Supports the blog: Onofri
		(2024) "Fixing the bridge between biologists and statisticians"
		https://www.statforbiology.com and the book: Onofri (2024)
		"Experimental Methods in Agriculture"
		https://www.statforbiology.com/_statbookeng/. The blog is a
		collection of short articles aimed at improving the efficiency
		of communication between biologists and statisticians, as
		pointed out in Kozak (2016) doi:10.1590/0103-9016-2015-0399,
		spreading a better awareness of the potential usefulness,
		beauty and limitations of biostatistic.
