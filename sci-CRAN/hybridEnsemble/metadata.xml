		Build, Deploy and Evaluate Hybrid Ensembles // Functions to build
		and deploy a hybrid ensemble consisting of different sub-
		ensembles such as bagged logistic regressions, random forest,
		stochastic boosting, kernel factory, bagged neural networks,
		bagged support vector machines, rotation forest, bagged
		k-nearest neighbors, and bagged naive Bayes. Functions to
