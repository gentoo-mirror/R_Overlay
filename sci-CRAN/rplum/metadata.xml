		Bayesian Age-Depth Modelling of Cores Dated by Pb-210 // An
		approach to age-depth modelling that uses Bayesian statistics
		to reconstruct accumulation histories for 210Pb-dated deposits
		using prior information. It can combine 210Pb, radiocarbon, and
		other dates in the chronologies. See Aquino et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1007/s13253-018-0328-7. Note that parts of the code
		underlying 'rplum' are derived from the 'rbacon' package by the
		same authors, and there remains a degree of overlap between the
		two packages.
