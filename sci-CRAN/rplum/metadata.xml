		Bayesian Age-Depth Modelling of '210Pb'-Dated Cores // An
		approach to age-depth modelling that uses Bayesian statistics
		to reconstruct accumulation histories for '210Pb'-dated
		deposits using prior information. It can combine '210Pb',
		radiocarbon, and other dates in the chronologies. See Aquino
		'et' 'al.' (2018) doi:10.1007/s13253-018-0328-7. Note that
		parts of the code underlying 'rplum' are derived from the
		'rbacon' package by the same authors. Subsequent versions of
		'rplum' and 'rbacon' are planned to reduce duplication, with
		'rplum' importing 'rbacon' instead.
