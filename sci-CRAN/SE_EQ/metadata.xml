		SE-Test for Equivalence // Implements the SE-test for equivalence
		according to Hoffelder et al. (2015)
		DOI:10.1080/10543406.2014.920344. The SE-test for equivalence
		is a multivariate two-sample equivalence test. Distance measure
		of the test is the sum of standardized differences between the
		expected values or in other words: the sum of effect sizes (SE)
		of all components of the two multivariate samples. The test is
		an asymptotically valid test for normally distributed data (see
		Hoffelder et al.,2015). The function SE.EQ() implements the SE-
		test for equivalence according to Hoffelder et al. (2015). The
		function SE.EQ.dissolution.profiles() implements a variant of
		the SE-test for equivalence for similarity analyses of
		dissolution profiles as mentioned in Suarez-Sharp et al.(2020)
		DOI:10.1208/s12248-020-00458-9). The equivalence margin used in
		SE.EQ.dissolution.profiles() is analogically defined as for the
		T2EQ approach according to Hoffelder (2019)
		DOI:10.1002/bimj.201700257) by means of a systematic shift in
		location of 10 [\% of label claim] of both dissolution profile
		populations. SE.EQ.dissolution.profiles() checks whether the
		weighted mean of the differences of the expected values of both
		dissolution profile populations is statistically significantly
		smaller than 10 [\% of label claim]. The weights are built up
		by the inverse variances.
