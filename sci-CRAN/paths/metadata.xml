		An Imputation Approach to Estimating Path-Specific Causal Effects
		// In causal mediation analysis with multiple causally ordered
		mediators, a set of path-specific effects are identified under
		standard ignorability assumptions. This package implements an
		imputation approach to estimating these effects along with a
		set of bias formulas for conducting sensitivity analysis (Zhou
		and Yamamoto doi:10.31235/osf.io/2rx6p). It contains two main
		functions: paths() for estimating path-specific effects and
		sens() for conducting sensitivity analysis. Estimation
		uncertainty is quantified using the nonparametric bootstrap.
