		Many-to-One Comparisons of Proportions // Asymptotic simultaneous
		confidence intervals for comparison of many treatments with one
		control, for the difference of binomial proportions, allows for
		Dunnett-like-adjustment, Bonferroni or unadjusted intervals.
		Simulation of power of the above interval methods, approximate
		calculation of any-pair-power, and sample size iteration based
		on approximate any-pair power. Exact conditional maximum test
		for many-to-one comparisons to a control.
