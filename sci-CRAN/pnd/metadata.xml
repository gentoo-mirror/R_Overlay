		Parallel Numerical Derivatives, Gradients, Jacobians, and
		Hessians of Arbitrary Accuracy Order // Numerical derivatives
		through finite-difference approximations can be calculated
		using the 'pnd' package with parallel capabilities and optimal
		step-size selection to improve accuracy. These functions
		facilitate efficient computation of derivatives, gradients,
		Jacobians, and Hessians, allowing for more evaluations to
		reduce the mathematical and machine errors. Designed for
		compatibility with the 'numDeriv' package, which has not
		received updates in several years, it introduces advanced
		features such as computing derivatives of arbitrary order,
		improving the accuracy of Hessian approximations by avoiding
		repeated differencing, and parallelising slow functions on
		Windows, Mac, and Linux.
