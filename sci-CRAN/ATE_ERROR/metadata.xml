		Estimating ATE with Misclassified Outcomes and Mismeasured
		Covariates // Addressing measurement error in covariates and
		misclassification in binary outcome variables within causal
		inference, the 'ATE.ERROR' package implements inverse
		probability weighted estimation methods proposed by Shu and Yi
		(2017, doi:10.1177/0962280217743777; 2019,
		doi:10.1002/sim.8073). These methods correct errors to
		accurately estimate average treatment effects (ATE). The
		package includes two main functions: ATE.ERROR.Y() for handling
		misclassification in the outcome variable and ATE.ERROR.XY()
		for correcting both outcome misclassification and covariate
		measurement error. It employs logistic regression for treatment
		assignment and uses bootstrap sampling to calculate standard
		errors and confidence intervals, with simulated datasets
		provided for practical demonstration.
