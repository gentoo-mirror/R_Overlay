		Spatially Varying Change Points // Implements a spatially varying
		change point model with unique intercepts, slopes, variance
		intercepts and slopes, and change points at each location.
		Inference is within the Bayesian setting using Markov chain
		Monte Carlo (MCMC). The response variable can be modeled as
		Gaussian (no nugget), probit or Tobit link and the five
		spatially varying parameter are modeled jointly using a
		multivariate conditional autoregressive (MCAR) prior. The MCAR
		is a unique process that allows for a dissimilarity metric to
		dictate the local spatial dependencies. Full details of the
		package can be found in the accompanying vignette. Furthermore,
		the details of the package can be found in the corresponding
		paper published in Spatial Statistics by Berchuck et al (2019):
		"A spatially varying change points model for monitoring
		glaucoma progression using visual field data",
