		Dave Armstrong's Miscellaneous Functions // Miscellaneous set of
		functions I use in my teaching either at the University of
		Western Ontario or the Inter-university Consortium for
		Political and Social Research (ICPSR) Summer Program in
		Quantitative Methods.  Broadly, the functions help with
		presentation and interpretation of LMs and GLMs, but also
		implement some new tools like Alternating Least Squares Optimal
		Scaling for dependent variables, a Bayesian analog to the ALSOS
		algorithm.  There are also tools to help understand
		interactions in both LMs and binary GLMs.
