		Fast Probabilistic Record Linkage with Missing Data // Implements
		a Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic record linkage model that allows
		for missing data and the inclusion of auxiliary information.
		This includes functionalities to conduct a merge of two
		datasets under the Fellegi-Sunter model using the Expectation-
		Maximization algorithm. In addition, tools for preparing,
		adjusting, and summarizing data merges are included. The
		package implements methods described in Enamorado, Fifield, and
		Imai (2019) ''Using a Probabilistic Model to Assist Merging of
		Large-scale Administrative Records''
		doi:10.1017/S0003055418000783 and is available at
		https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/linkage.html.
