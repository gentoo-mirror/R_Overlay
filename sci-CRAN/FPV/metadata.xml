		Testing Hypotheses via Fuzzy P-Value in Fuzzy Environment // The
		main goal of this package is drawing the membership function of
		the fuzzy p-value which is defined as a fuzzy set on the unit
		interval for three following problems: (1) testing crisp
		hypotheses based on fuzzy data, see Filzmoser and Viertl (2004)
		doi:10.1007/s001840300269, (2) testing fuzzy hypotheses based
		on crisp data, see Parchami et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1007/s00362-008-0133-4, and (3) testing fuzzy hypotheses
		based on fuzzy data, see Parchami et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1007/s00362-010-0353-2. In all cases, the fuzziness of
		data or / and the fuzziness of the boundary of null fuzzy
		hypothesis transported via the p-value function and causes to
		produce the fuzzy p-value. If the p-value is fuzzy, it is more
		appropriate to consider a fuzzy significance level for the
		problem. Therefore, the comparison of the fuzzy p-value and the
		fuzzy significance level is evaluated by a fuzzy ranking method
		in this package.
