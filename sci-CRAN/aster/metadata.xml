		Aster Models // Aster models (Geyer, Wagenius, and Shaw, 2007,
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asm030; Shaw, Geyer, Wagenius, Hangelbroek,
		and Etterson, 2008, doi:10.1086/588063; Geyer, Ridley, Latta,
		Etterson, and Shaw, 2013, doi:10.1214/13-AOAS653) are
		exponential family regression models for life history analysis.
		They are like generalized linear models except that elements of
		the response vector can have different families (e. g., some
		Bernoulli, some Poisson, some zero-truncated Poisson, some
		normal) and can be dependent, the dependence indicated by a
		graphical structure. Discrete time survival analysis, life
		table analysis, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and
		generalized linear models that are exponential family (e. g.,
		logistic regression and Poisson regression with log link) are
		special cases. Main use is for data in which there is survival
		over discrete time periods and there is additional data about
		what happens conditional on survival (e. g., number of
		offspring).  Uses the exponential family canonical
		parameterization (aster transform of usual parameterization).
		There are also random effects versions of these models.
