		Annotated Matrix: Matrices with Persistent Row and Column
		Annotations // Implements persistent row and column annotations
		for R matrices. The annotations associated with rows and
		columns are preserved after subsetting, transposition, and
		various other matrix-specific operations. Intended use case is
		for storing and manipulating genomic datasets which typically
		consist of a matrix of measurements (like gene expression
		values) as well as annotations about rows (i.e. genomic
		locations) and annotations about columns (i.e. meta-data about
		collected samples). But 'annmatrix' objects are also expected
		to be useful in various other contexts.
