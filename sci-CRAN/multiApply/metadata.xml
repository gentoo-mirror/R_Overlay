		Apply Functions to Multiple Multidimensional Arrays or Vectors //
		The base apply function and its variants, as well as the
		related functions in the 'plyr' package, typically apply user-
		defined functions to a single argument (or a list of vectorized
		arguments in the case of mapply). The 'multiApply' package
		extends this paradigm with its only function, Apply, which
		efficiently applies functions taking one or a list of multiple
		unidimensional or multidimensional arrays (or combinations
		thereof) as input. The input arrays can have different numbers
		of dimensions as well as different dimension lengths, and the
		applied function can return one or a list of unidimensional or
		multidimensional arrays as output. This saves development time
		by preventing the R user from writing often error-prone and
		memory-inefficient loops dealing with multiple complex arrays.
		Also, a remarkable feature of Apply is the transparent use of
		multi-core through its parameter 'ncores'. In contrast to the
		base apply function, this package suggests the use of 'target
		dimensions' as opposite to the 'margins' for specifying the
		dimensions relevant to the function to be applied.
