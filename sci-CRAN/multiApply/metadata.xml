		Apply Functions to Multiple Multidimensional Arguments // The
		base apply function and its variants, as well as the related
		functions in the 'plyr' package, typically apply user-defined
		functions to a single argument (or a list of vectorized
		arguments in the case of mapply). The 'multiApply' package
		extends this paradigm to functions taking a list of multiple
		unidimensional or multidimensional arguments (or combinations
		thereof) as input, which can have different numbers of
		dimensions as well as different dimension lengths.
