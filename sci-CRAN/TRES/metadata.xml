		Tensor Regression with Envelope Structure // Provides three
		estimators for tensor response regression (TRR) and tensor
		predictor regression (TPR) models with tensor envelope
		structure. The three types of estimation approaches are generic
		and can be applied to any envelope estimation problems. The
		full Grassmannian (FG) optimization is often associated with
		likelihood-based estimation but requires heavy computation and
		good initialization; the one-directional optimization
		approaches (1D and ECD algorithms) are faster, stable and does
		not require carefully chosen initial values; the SIMPLS-type is
		motivated by the partial least squares regression and is
		computationally the least expensive. For details of TRR, see Li
		L, Zhang X (2017) doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1193022. For
		details of TPR, see Zhang X, Li L (2017)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.2016.1272495. For details of 1D algorithm,
		see Cook RD, Zhang X (2016) doi:10.1080/10618600.2015.1029577.
		For details of ECD algorithm, see Cook RD, Zhang X (2018)
		doi:10.5705/ss.202016.0037. For more details of the package,
