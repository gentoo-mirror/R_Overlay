		Tensor Regression with Envelope Structure and Three Generic
		Envelope Estimation Approaches // Provides three estimators for
		tensor response regression (TRR) and tensor predictor
		regression (TPR) models with tensor envelope structure. The
		three types of estimation approaches are generic and can be
		applied to any envelope estimation problems. The full
		Grassmannian (FG) optimization is often associated with
		likelihood-based estimation but requires heavy computation and
		good initialization; the one-directional optimization
		approaches (1D and ECD algorithms) are faster, stable and does
		not require carefully chosen initial values; the SIMPLS-type is
		motivated by the partial least squares regression and is
		computationally the least expensive.
