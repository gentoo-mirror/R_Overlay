		Treatment Effect Estimation for Time-to-Event Data with
		Intercurrent Events // Analyzing treatment effects in clinical
		trials with time-to-event outcomes is complicated by
		intercurrent events. This package implements methods for
		estimating and inferring the cumulative incidence functions for
		time-to-event (TTE) outcomes with intercurrent events (ICEs)
		under the five strategies outlined in the ICH E9 (R1) addendum,
		see Deng (2025)doi:10.1002/sim.70091. This package can be used
		for analyzing data from both randomized controlled trials and
		observational studies. In general, we have a primary outcome
		event and possibly an intercurrent event. Two data structures
		are allowed: competing risks, where only the time to the first
		event is recorded, and semicompeting risks, where the times to
		both the primary outcome event and intercurrent event (or
		censoring) are recorded. For estimation methods, users can
		choose nonparametric estimation (which does not use covariates)
		and semiparametrically efficient estimation.
