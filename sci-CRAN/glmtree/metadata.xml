		Logistic Regression Trees // A logistic regression tree is a
		decision tree with logistic regressions at its leaves. A
		particular stochastic expectation maximization algorithm is
		used to draw a few good trees, that are then assessed via the
		user's criterion of choice among BIC / AIC / test set Gini. The
		formal development is given in a PhD chapter, see Ehrhardt
		(2019) https://github.com/adimajo/manuscrit_these/releases/.
