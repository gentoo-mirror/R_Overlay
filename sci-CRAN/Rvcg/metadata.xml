		Manipulations of Triangular Meshes Based on the 'VCGLIB' API //
		Operations on triangular meshes based on 'VCGLIB'. This package
		integrates nicely with the R-package 'rgl' to render the meshes
		processed by 'Rvcg'. The Visualization and Computer Graphics
		Library (VCG for short) is an open source portable C++
		templated library for manipulation, processing and displaying
		with OpenGL of triangle and tetrahedral meshes. The library,
		composed by more than 100k lines of code, is released under the
		GPL license, and it is the base of most of the software tools
		of the Visual Computing Lab of the Italian National Research
		Council Institute ISTI https://vcg.isti.cnr.it/, like 'metro'
		and 'MeshLab'. The 'VCGLIB' source is pulled from trunk
		https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib and patched to work
		with options determined by the configure script as well as to
		work with the header files included by 'RcppEigen'.
