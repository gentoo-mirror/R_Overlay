		Combination Matrix Axis for 'ggplot2' to Create 'UpSet' Plots //
		Replace the standard x-axis in 'ggplots' with a combination
		matrix to visualize complex set overlaps. 'UpSet' has
		introduced a new way to visualize the overlap of sets as an
		alternative to Venn diagrams. This package provides a simple
		way to produce such plots using 'ggplot2'. In addition it can
		convert any categorical axis into a combination matrix axis.
