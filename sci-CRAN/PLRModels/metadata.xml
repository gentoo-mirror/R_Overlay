		Statistical Inference in Partial Linear Regression Models //
		Contains statistical inference tools applied to Partial Linear
		Regression (PLR) models. Specifically, point estimation,
		confidence intervals estimation, bandwidth selection, goodness-
		of-fit tests and analysis of covariance are considered. Kernel-
		based methods, combined with ordinary least squares estimation,
		are used and time series errors are allowed. In addition, these
		techniques are also implemented for both parametric (linear)
		and nonparametric regression models.
