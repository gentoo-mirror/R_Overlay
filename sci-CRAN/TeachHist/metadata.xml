		A Collection of Amended Histograms Designed for Teaching
		Statistics // Statistics students often have problems
		understanding the relation between a random variable's true
		scale and its z-values. To allow instructors to better better
		visualize histograms for these students, the package provides
		histograms with two horizontal axis containing z-values and the
		true scale of the variable. The function TeachHistDens()
		provides a density histogram with two axis. TeachHistCounts()
		and TeachHistRelFreq() are variations for count and relative
		frequency histograms, respectively. TeachConfInterv() and
		TeachHypTest() help instructors to visualize confidence levels
		and the results of hypothesis tests.
