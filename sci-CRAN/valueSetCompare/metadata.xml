		Comparing HRQoL Instrument Value Sets // The number of countries
		with multiple Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) value sets
		is growing, and this trend is expected to continue. Each
		instrument and value set characterizes and values health
		differently. Identical health states can yield different
		utility values when valued using different value sets. The
		'valueSetCompare' package facilitates comparisons of HRQoL
		value sets, enabling both theoretical and empirical
		comparisons. For empirical comparisons, it employs a novel
		simulation-based method by Jiang et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1186/s12955-022-02031-8, allowing users to investigate
		the responsiveness of HRQoL instruments across the entire
		health spectrum using cross-sectional data with external health
		anchors.
