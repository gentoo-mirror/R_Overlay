		Create and Manipulate Vocalisation Diagrams // Create adjacency
		matrices of vocalisation graphs from dataframes containing
		sequences of speech and silence intervals, transforming these
		matrices into Markov diagrams, and generating datasets for
		classification of these diagrams by 'flattening' them and
		adding global properties (functionals) etc.  Vocalisation
		diagrams date back to early work in psychiatry (Jaffe and
		Feldstein, 1970) and social psychology (Dabbs and Ruback, 1987)
		but have only recently been employed as a data representation
		method for machine learning tasks including meeting
		segmentation (Luz, 2012) doi:10.1145/2328967.2328970 and
		classification (Luz, 2013) doi:10.1145/2522848.2533788.
