		Chronomics Analysis Toolkit (CAT): Periodicity Analysis //
		Calculates auto- and cross-correlation functions and plots an
		actogram and a smoothing function from a time series to
		identify and visualize periodic components. Tests presence of
		anticipated rhythm and estimates rhythm parameters; fits model
		consisting of multiple rhythmic components to data; performs
		least squares spectral analysis and other cosinor-based
		analyses, including population-mean cosinor (pmc).
