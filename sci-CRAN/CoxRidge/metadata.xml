		Cox Models with Dynamic Ridge Penalties // A package for fitting
		Cox models with penalized ridge-type partial likelihood. The
		package includes functions for fitting simple Cox models with
		all covariates controlled by a ridge penalty. The weight of the
		penalty is optimised by using a REML type-algorithm. Models
		with time varying effects of the covariates can also be fitted.
		Some of the covariates may be allowed to be fixed and thus not
		controlled by the penalty. There are three different penalty
		functions, ridge, dynamic and weighted dynamic. Time varying
		effects can be fitted without the need of an expanded dataset.
