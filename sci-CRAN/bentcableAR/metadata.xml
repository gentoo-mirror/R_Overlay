		Bent-Cable Regression for Independent Data or Autoregressive Time
		Series // Included are two main interfaces, bentcable.ar() and
		bentcable.dev.plot(), for fitting and diagnosing bent-cable
		regressions for autoregressive time-series data (Chiu and
		Lockhart 2010, doi:10.1002/cjs.10070) or independent data (time
		series or otherwise - Chiu, Lockhart and Routledge 2006,
		doi:10.1198/016214505000001177). Some components in the package
		can also be used as stand-alone functions. The bent cable
		(linear-quadratic-linear) generalizes the broken stick (linear-
		linear), which is also handled by this package. Version 0.2
		corrected a glitch in the computation of confidence intervals
		for the CTP. References that were updated from Versions 0.2.1
		and 0.2.2 appear in Version 0.2.3 and up. Version 0.3.0
		improved robustness of the error-message producing mechanism.
		Version 0.3.1 improves the NAMESPACE file of the package. It is
		the author's intention to distribute any future updates via
		GitHub.
