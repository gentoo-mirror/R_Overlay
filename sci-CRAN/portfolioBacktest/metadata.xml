		Automated Backtesting of Portfolios over Multiple Datasets //
		Automated backtesting of multiple portfolios over multiple
		datasets of stock prices in a rolling-window fashion. Intended
		for researchers and practitioners to backtest a set of
		different portfolios, as well as by a course instructor to
		assess the students in their portfolio design in a fully
		automated and convenient manner, with results conveniently
		formatted in tables and plots. Each portfolio design is easily
		defined as a function that takes as input a window of the stock
		prices and outputs the portfolio weights. Multiple portfolios
		can be easily specified as a list of functions or as files in a
		folder. Multiple datasets can be conveniently extracted
		randomly from different markets, different time periods, and
		different subsets of the stock universe. The results can be
		later assessed and ranked with tables based on a number of
		performance criteria (e.g., expected return, volatility, Sharpe
		ratio, drawdown, turnover rate, return on investment,
		computational time, etc.), as well as plotted in a number of
		ways with nice barplots and boxplots.
