		Library of Research Designs // A simple interface to build
		designs using the package 'DeclareDesign'. In one line of code,
		users can specify the parameters of individual designs and
		diagnose their properties. The designers can also be used to
		compare performance of a given design across a range of
		combinations of parameters, such as effect size, sample size,
		and assignment probabilities.
