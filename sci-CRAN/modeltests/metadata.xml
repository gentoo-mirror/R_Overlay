		Testing Infrastructure for Broom Model Generics // Provides a
		number of testthat tests that can be used to verify that
		tidy(), glance() and augment() methods meet consistent
		specifications. This allows methods for the same generic to be
		spread across multiple packages, since all of those packages
		can make the same guarantees to users about returned objects.
