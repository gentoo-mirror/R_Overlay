		UNHCR Refugee Population Statistics Database // The Refugee
		Population Statistics Database published by The Office of The
		United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) contains
		information about forcibly displaced populations spanning more
		than 70 years of statistical activities. It covers displaced
		populations such as refugees, asylum-seekers and internally
		displaced people, including their demographics. Stateless
		people are also included, most of who have never been
		displaced. The database also reflects the different types of
		solutions for displaced populations such as repatriation or
		resettlement. More information on the data and methodology can
		be found on the UNHCR Refugee Data Finder
		https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/.
