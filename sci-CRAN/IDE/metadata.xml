		Integro-Difference Equation Spatio-Temporal Models // The
		Integro-Difference Equation model is a linear, dynamical model
		used to model phenomena that evolve in space and in time; see,
		for example, Cressie and Wikle (2011, ISBN:978-0-471-69274-4)
		or Dewar et al. (2009) doi:10.1109/TSP.2008.2005091. At the
		heart of the model is the kernel, which dictates how the
		process evolves from one time point to the next. Both process
		and parameter reduction are used to facilitate computation, and
		spatially-varying kernels are allowed. Data used to estimate
		the parameters are assumed to be readings of the process
		corrupted by Gaussian measurement error. Parameters are fitted
		by maximum likelihood, and estimation is carried out using an
		evolution algorithm.
