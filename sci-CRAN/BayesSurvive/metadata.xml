		Bayesian Survival Models for High-Dimensional Data // An
		implementation of Bayesian survival models with graph-
		structured selection priors for sparse identification of omics
		features predictive of survival (Madjar et al., 2021
		doi:10.1186/s12859-021-04483-z) and its extension to use a
		fixed graph via a Markov Random Field (MRF) prior for capturing
		known structure of omics features, e.g. disease-specific
		pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
		database.
