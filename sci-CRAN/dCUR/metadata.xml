		Dimension Reduction with Dynamic CUR // Dynamic CUR (dCUR) boosts
		the CUR decomposition (Mahoney MW., Drineas P. (2009)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.0803205106) varying the k, the number of
		columns and rows used, and its final purposes to help find the
		stage, which minimizes the relative error to reduce matrix
		dimension. The goal of CUR Decomposition is to give a better
		interpretation of the matrix decomposition employing proper
		variable selection in the data matrix, in a way that yields a
		simplified structure. Its origins come from analysis in
		genetics. The goal of this package is to show an alternative to
		variable selection (columns) or individuals (rows). The idea
		proposed consists of adjusting the probability distributions to
		the leverage scores and selecting the best columns and rows
		that minimize the reconstruction error of the matrix
		approximation ||A-CUR||. It also includes a method that
		recalibrates the relative importance of the leverage scores
		according to an external variable of the user's interest.
