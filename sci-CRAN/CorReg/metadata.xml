		Linear Regression Based on Linear Structure Between Variables //
		Linear regression based on a recursive structural equation
		model (explicit multiples correlations) found by a
		M.C.M.C.(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithm. It permits to
		face highly correlated variables. Variable selection is
		included (by lasso, elastic net, etc.). It also provides some
		graphical tools for basic statistics. For more information
		about the method, read the PhD thesis of Clement Thery (2015)
		in the link below.
