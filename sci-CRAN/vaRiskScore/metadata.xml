		VA CVD Risk Score // Estimates the predicted 10-year
		cardiovascular (CVD) risk score (in probability) for women
		military service members and veterans by inputting patient
		profiles. The proposed women CVD risk score improves the
		accuracy of the existing American College of
		Cardiology/American Heart Association CVD risk assessment tool
		in predicting longterm CVD risk for VA women, particularly in
		young and racial/ethnic minority women. See the reference:
