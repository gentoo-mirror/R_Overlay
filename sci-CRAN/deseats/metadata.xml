		Data-Driven Locally Weighted Regression for Trend and Seasonality
		in TS // Various methods for the identification of trend and
		seasonal components in time series (TS) are provided. Among
		them is a data-driven locally weighted regression approach with
		automatically selected bandwidth for equidistant short-memory
		time series. The approach is a combination / extension of the
		algorithms by Feng (2013) doi:10.1080/02664763.2012.740626 and
		Feng, Y., Gries, T., and Fritz, M. (2020)
		doi:10.1080/10485252.2020.1759598 and a brief description of
		this new method is provided in the package documentation.
		Furthermore, the package allows its users to apply the base
		model of the Berlin procedure, version 4.1, as described in
		Speth (2004) https://www.destatis.de/DE/Methoden/Saisonbereinig
		ung/BV41-methodenbericht-Heft3_2004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile.
		Permission to include this procedure was kindly provided by the
		Federal Statistical Office of Germany.
