		Optimisation with Continuous Convex Piecewise (Linear and
		Quadratic) Functions // Continuous convex piecewise linear
		(ccpl) resp. quadratic (ccpq) functions can be implemented with
		sorted breakpoints and slopes. This includes functions that are
		ccpl (resp. ccpq) on a convex set (i.e. an interval or a point)
		and infinite out of the domain. These functions can be very
		useful for a large class of optimisation problems. Efficient
		manipulation (such as log(N) insertion) of such data structure
		is obtained with map standard template library of C++ (that
		hides balanced trees). This package is a wrapper on such a
		class based on Rcpp modules.
