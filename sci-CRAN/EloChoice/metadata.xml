		Preference Rating for Visual Stimuli Based on Elo Ratings //
		Allows calculating global scores for characteristics of visual
		stimuli as assessed by human raters. Stimuli are presented as
		sequence of pairwise comparisons ('contests'), during each of
		which a rater expresses preference for one stimulus over the
		other (forced choice). The algorithm for calculating global
		scores is based on Elo rating, which updates individual scores
		after each single pairwise contest. Elo rating is widely used
		to rank chess players according to their performance. Its core
		feature is that dyadic contests with expected outcomes lead to
		smaller changes of participants' scores than outcomes that were
		unexpected. As such, Elo rating is an efficient tool to rate
		individual stimuli when a large number of such stimuli are
		paired against each other in the context of experiments where
		the goal is to rank stimuli according to some characteristic of
		interest. Clark et al (2018) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0190393
		provide details.
