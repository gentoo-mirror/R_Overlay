		Optimal Convex M-Estimation for Linear Regression via Antitonic
		Score Matching // Performs linear regression with respect to a
		data-driven convex loss function that is chosen to minimize the
		asymptotic covariance of the resulting M-estimator. The convex
		loss function is estimated in 5 steps: (1) form an initial OLS
		(ordinary least squares) or LAD (least absolute deviation)
		estimate of the regression coefficients; (2) use the resulting
		residuals to obtain a kernel estimator of the error density;
		(3) estimate the score function of the errors by
		differentiating the logarithm of the kernel density estimate;
		(4) compute the L2 projection of the estimated score function
		onto the set of decreasing functions; (5) take a negative
		antiderivative of the projected score function estimate.
		Newton's method (with Hessian modification) is then used to
		minimize the convex empirical risk function. Further details of
		the method are given in Feng et al. (2024)
