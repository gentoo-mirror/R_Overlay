		Bayesian Multivariate Meta-Analysis // Objective Bayesian
		inference procedures for the parameters of the multivariate
		random effects model with application to multivariate meta-
		analysis. The posterior for the model parameters, namely the
		overall mean vector and the between-study covariance matrix,
		are assessed by constructing Markov chains based on the
		Metropolis-Hastings algorithms as developed in Bodnar and
		Bodnar (2021) (arXiv:2104.02105). The Metropolis-Hastings
		algorithm is designed under the assumption of the normal
		distribution and the t-distribution when the Berger and
		Bernardo reference prior and the Jeffreys prior are assigned to
		the model parameters. Convergence properties of the generated
		Markov chains are investigated by the rank plots and the split
		hat-R estimate based on the rank normalization, which are
		proposed in Vehtari et al. (2021) (DOI:10.1214/20-BA1221).
