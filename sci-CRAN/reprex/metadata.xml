		Prepare Reproducible Example Code for Sharing // Convenience
		wrapper that uses the 'rmarkdown' package to render small
		snippets of code to target formats that include both code and
		output. The goal is to encourage the sharing of small,
		reproducible, and runnable examples on code-oriented websites,
		such as http://stackoverflow.com and https://github.com, or in
		email. 'reprex' also extracts clean, runnable R code from
		various common formats, such as copy/paste from an R session.
