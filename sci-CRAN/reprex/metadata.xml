		Prepare Reproducible Example Code via the Clipboard //
		Convenience wrapper that uses the 'rmarkdown' package to render
		small snippets of code to target formats that include both code
		and output.  The goal is to encourage the sharing of small,
		reproducible, and runnable examples on code-oriented websites,
		such as https://stackoverflow.com and https://github.com, or in
		email. The user's clipboard is the default source of input code
		and the default target for rendered output. 'reprex' also
		extracts clean, runnable R code from various common formats,
		such as copy/paste from an R session.
