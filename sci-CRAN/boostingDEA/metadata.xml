		A Boosting Approach to Data Envelopment Analysis // Includes
		functions to estimate production frontiers and make ideal
		output predictions in the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
		context using both standard models from DEA and Free Disposal
		Hull (FDH) and boosting techniques. In particular, EATBoosting
		(Guillen et al., 2023 doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119134) and
		MARSBoosting. Moreover, the package includes code for
		estimating several technical efficiency measures using
		different models such as the input and output-oriented radial
		measures, the input and output-oriented Russell measures, the
		Directional Distance Function (DDF), the Weighted Additive
		Measure (WAM) and the Slacks-Based Measure (SBM).
