		Tidy Tools for Visualizing Mixture Models // The main function,
		plot_mm(), is used for plotting output from mixture models,
		including both densities and overlaying mixture weight
		component curves from the fit models. In line with the
		tidyverse, the package also includes the plot_cut_point()
		function to visualize the cutpoint (mu) from the model over a
		histogram of the data density with several color options.
		Finally, the package includes the plot_mix_comps() helper
		function, which is used for both added customization as well as
		in the plot_mm() function. Supported model objects include:
		'mixtools', 'EMCluster', and 'flexmix', with more from each
		forthcoming. Supported mixture model specifications include
		mixtures of univariate Gaussians, multivariate Gaussians,
		Gammas, logistic regressions, linear regressions, and Poisson
		regressions.
