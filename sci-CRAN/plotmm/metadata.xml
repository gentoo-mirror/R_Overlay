		Tidy Tools for Visualizing Mixture Models // The main function,
		plot_mm(), is used for (gg)plotting output from mixture models,
		including both densities and overlaying mixture weight
		component curves from the fit models in line with the tidy
		principles. The package includes several additional functions
		for added plot customization. Supported model objects include:
		'mixtools', 'EMCluster', and 'flexmix', with more from each in
		active dev. Supported mixture model specifications include
		mixtures of univariate Gaussians, multivariate Gaussians,
		Gammas, logistic regressions, linear regressions, and Poisson
		regressions.
