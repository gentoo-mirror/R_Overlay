		Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data // Joint
		analysis and imputation of incomplete data in the Bayesian
		framework, using (generalized) linear (mixed) models and
		extensions there of, survival models, or joint models for
		longitudinal and survival data. Incomplete covariates, if
		present, are automatically imputed. The package performs some
		preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS' model, which
		will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS' http://mcmc-
		jags.sourceforge.net/ with the help of the package 'rjags'.
