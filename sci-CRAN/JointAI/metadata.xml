		Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data // Provides
		joint analysis and imputation of linear regression models,
		generalized linear regression models or linear mixed models
		with incomplete (covariate) data in the Bayesian framework. The
		package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a
		'JAGS' model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS'
		http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net with the help of the package
		'rjags'. It also provides summary and plotting functions for
		the output.
