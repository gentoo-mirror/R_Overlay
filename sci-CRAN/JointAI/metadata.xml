		Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data // Joint
		analysis and imputation of incomplete data in the Bayesian
		framework, using (generalized) linear (mixed) models and
		extensions there of, survival models, or joint models for
		longitudinal and survival data, as described in Erler,
		Rizopoulos and Lesaffre (2021) doi:10.18637/jss.v100.i20.
		Incomplete covariates, if present, are automatically imputed.
		The package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates
		a 'JAGS' model, which will then automatically be passed to
		'JAGS' https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/ with the help of the
		package 'rjags'.
