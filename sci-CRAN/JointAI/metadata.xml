		Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data // Provides
		joint analysis and imputation of (generalized) linear and
		cumulative logit regression models, (generalized) linear and
		cumulative logit mixed models and parametric (Weibull) as well
		as Cox proportional hazards survival models with incomplete
		(covariate) data in the Bayesian framework. The package
		performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS'
		model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS' http
		://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net with the help of the package
		'rjags'. It also provides summary and plotting functions for
		the output and allows the user to export imputed values.
