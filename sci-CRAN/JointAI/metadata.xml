		Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data // Provides
		joint analysis and imputation of (generalized) linear
		regression models, (generalized) linear mixed models and
		parametric survival models with incomplete (covariate) data in
		the Bayesian framework. The package performs some preprocessing
		of the data and creates a 'JAGS' model, which will then
		automatically be passed to 'JAGS' http://mcmc-
		jags.sourceforge.net with the help of the package 'rjags'. It
		also provides summary and plotting functions for the output.
