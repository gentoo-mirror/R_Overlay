		Sensitivity Analysis for Publication Bias in Meta-Analyses //
		Performs sensitivity analysis for publication bias in meta-
		analyses (per Mathur  VanderWeele, 2019
		[https://osf.io/s9dp6]). These analyses enable statements such
		as: "For publication bias to shift the observed point estimate
		to the null, 'significant' results would need to be at least
		30-fold more likely to be published than negative or
		'nonsignificant' results." Comparable statements can be made
		regarding shifting to a chosen non-null value or shifting the
		confidence interval. Provides a worst-case meta-analytic point
		estimate under maximal publication bias obtained simply by
		conducting a standard meta-analysis of only the negative and
		"nonsignificant" studies.
