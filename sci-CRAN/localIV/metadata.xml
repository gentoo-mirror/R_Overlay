		Estimation of Marginal Treatment Effects using Local Instrumental
		Variables // In the generalized Roy model, the marginal
		treatment effect (MTE) can be used as a building block for
		constructing conventional causal parameters such as the average
		treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the
		treated (ATT). Given a treatment selection equation and an
		outcome equation, the function mte() estimates the MTE via the
		semiparametric local instrumental variables method or the
		normal selection model. The function mte_at() evaluates MTE at
		different values of the latent resistance u with a given X = x,
		and the function mte_tilde_at() evaluates MTE projected onto
		the estimated propensity score. The function ace() estimates
		population-level average causal effects such as ATE, ATT, or
		the marginal policy relevant treatment effect.
