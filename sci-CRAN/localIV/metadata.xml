		Estimation of Marginal Treatment Effects using Local Instrumental
		Variables // In the generalized Roy model, the marginal
		treatment effect (MTE) can be used as a building block for
		constructing conventional causal parameters such as the average
		treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the
		treated (ATT) (Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil 2006
		doi:10.1162/rest.88.3.389). Given a treatment selection model
		and an outcome model, the function mte() estimates the MTE via
		a semiparametric local instrumental variables method (or via a
		normal selection model). The function eval_mte() evaluates MTE
		at any combination of covariates x and latent resistance u, and
		the function eval_mte_tilde() evaluates MTE projected onto the
		estimated propensity score (Zhou and Xie 2019
		https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/702172). The
		object returned by mte() can be used to estimate conventional
		parameters such as ATE, ATT, and ATU (via average()) or
		marginal policy-relevant treatment effects (via mprte()).
