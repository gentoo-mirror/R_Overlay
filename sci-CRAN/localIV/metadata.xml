		Estimation of Marginal Treatment Effects using Local Instrumental
		Variables // In the generalized Roy model, the marginal
		treatment effect (MTE) can be used as a building block for
		constructing conventional causal parameters such as the average
		treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the
		treated (ATT) (Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil 2006
		doi:10.1162/rest.88.3.389). Given a treatment selection model
		and an outcome model, the function mte() estimates the MTE via
		local instrumental variables (or via a normal selection model)
		and also the projection of MTE onto the 2-dimensional space of
		the propensity score and a latent variable representing
		unobserved resistance to treatment (Zhou and Xie 2018
		https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/xzhou/files/zhou-
		xie_mte2.pdf). The object returned by mte() can be used to
		estimate conventional parameters such as ATE and ATT (via
		average()) or marginal policy-relevant treatment effects (via
		mprte()).
