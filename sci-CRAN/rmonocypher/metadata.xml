		Easy Encryption of R Objects using Strong Modern Cryptography //
		Encrypt R objects to a raw vector or file using modern
		cryptographic techniques.  Password-based key derivation is
		with 'Argon2' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2). Objects
		are serialized and then encrypted using 'XChaCha20-Poly1305'
		(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) which follows
		RFC 8439 for authenticated encryption
		(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption).
		Cryptographic functions are provided by the included
		'monocypher' 'C' library (https://monocypher.org).
