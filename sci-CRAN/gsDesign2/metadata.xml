		Group Sequential Design with Non-Constant Effect // The goal of
		'gsDesign2' is to enable fixed or group sequential design under
		non-proportional hazards. To enable highly flexible enrollment,
		time-to-event and time-to-dropout assumptions, 'gsDesign2'
		offers piecewise constant enrollment, failure rates, and
		dropout rates for a stratified population. This package
		includes three methods for designs: average hazard ratio,
		weighted logrank tests in Yung and Liu (2019)
		doi:10.1111/biom.13196, and MaxCombo tests. Substantial
		flexibility on top of what is in the 'gsDesign' package is
		intended for selecting boundaries.
