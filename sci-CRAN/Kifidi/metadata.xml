		Summary Table and Means Plots // Optimized for handling complex
		datasets in environmental and ecological research, this package
		offers functionality that is not fully met by general-purpose
		packages. It provides two key functions, 'summarize_data()',
		which summarizes datasets, and 'plot_means()', which creates
		plots with error bars. The 'plot_means()' function incorporates
		error bars by default, allowing quick visualization of
		uncertainties, crucial in ecological studies. It also
		streamlines workflows for grouped datasets (e.g., by species or
		treatment), making it particularly user-friendly and reducing
		the complexity and time required for data summarization and
		visualization.
