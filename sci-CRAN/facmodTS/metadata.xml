		Time Series Factor Models for Asset Returns // Supports teaching
		methods of estimating and testing time series factor models for
		use in robust portfolio construction and analysis. Unique in
		providing not only classical least squares, but also modern
		robust model fitting methods which are not much influenced by
		outliers. Includes returns and risk decompositions, with user
		choice of  standard deviation, value-at-risk, and expected
		shortfall risk measures. "Robust Statistics Theory and Methods
