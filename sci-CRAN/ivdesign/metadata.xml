		Hypothesis Testing in Cluster-Randomized Encouragement Designs //
		An implementation of randomization-based hypothesis testing for
		three different estimands in a cluster-randomized encouragement
		experiment. The three estimands include (1) testing a cluster-
		level constant proportional treatment effect (Fisher's sharp
		null hypothesis), (2) pooled effect ratio, and (3) average
		cluster effect ratio. To test the third estimand, user needs to
		install 'Gurobi' (= 9.0.1) optimizer via its R API. Please
		refer to https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/refman/ins_th
		e_r_package.html.
