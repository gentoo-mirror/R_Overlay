		Compute Cortisol Sine Score (CSS) for Diurnal Cortisol Analysis
		// Computes a single scalar metric for diurnal cortisol cycle
		analysis, the Cortisol Sine Score (CSS). The score is
		calculated as the sum over time points of concentration
		multiplied by sin(2 * pi * time / 24), giving positive weights
		to morning time points and negative weights to evening ones.
		The method is model-free, robust, and suitable for regression,
		classification, clustering, and biomarker research.
