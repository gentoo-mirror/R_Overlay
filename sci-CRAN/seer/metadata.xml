		Feature-Based Forecast Model Selection // A novel meta-learning
		framework for forecast model selection using time series
		features. Many applications require a large number of time
		series to be forecast. Providing better forecasts for these
		time series is important in decision and policy making. We
		propose a classification framework which selects forecast
		models based on features calculated from the time series. We
		call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model
		Selection). FFORMS builds a mapping that relates the features
		of time series to the best forecast model using a random
		forest. 'seer' package is the implementation of the FFORMS
		algorithm. For more details see our paper at
		https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-
		statistics/research/publications/ebs/wp06-2018.pdf.
