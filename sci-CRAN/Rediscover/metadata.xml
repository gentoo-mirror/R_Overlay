		Identify Mutually Exclusive Mutations // An optimized method for
		identifying mutually exclusive genomic events.  Its main
		contribution is a statistical analysis based on the Poisson-
		Binomial distribution that takes into account that some samples
		are more mutated than others. See [Canisius, Sander, John WM
		Martens, and  Lodewyk FA Wessels. (2016)  "A novel independence
		test for somatic alterations in cancer shows that biology
		drives mutual exclusivity but chance explains most co-
		occurrence." Genome biology 17.1 : 1-17.
		doi:10.1186/s13059-016-1114-x]. The mutations matrices are
		sparse matrices. The method developed takes advantage of the
		advantages of this type of matrix to save time and computing
		resources.
