		Functions to Operate on Binary Fingerprint Data // Functions to
		manipulate binary fingerprints of arbitrary length. A
		fingerprint is represented by an object of S4 class
		'fingerprint' which is internally represented a vector of
		integers, such that each element represents the position in the
		fingerprint that is set to 1. The bitwise logical functions in
		R are overridden so that they can be used directly with
		'fingerprint' objects. A number of distance metrics are also
		available (many contributed by Michael Fadock). Fingerprints
		can be converted to Euclidean vectors (i.e., points on the unit
		hypersphere) and can also be folded using OR.  Arbitrary
		fingerprint formats can be handled via line handlers. Currently
		handlers are provided for CDK, MOE and BCI fingerprint data.
