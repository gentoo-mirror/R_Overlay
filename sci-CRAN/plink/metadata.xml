		IRT Separate Calibration Linking Methods // Item response theory
		based methods are used to compute linking constants and conduct
		chain linking of unidimensional or multidimensional tests for
		multiple groups under a common item design.  The unidimensional
		methods include the Mean/Mean, Mean/Sigma, Haebara, and
		Stocking-Lord methods for dichotomous (1PL, 2PL and 3PL) and/or
		polytomous (graded response, partial credit/generalized partial
		credit, nominal, and multiple-choice model) items.  The
		multidimensional methods include the least squares method and
		extensions of the Haebara and Stocking-Lord method using single
		or multiple dilation parameters for multidimensional extensions
		of all the unidimensional dichotomous and polytomous item
		response models.  The package also includes functions for
		importing item and/or ability parameters from common IRT
		software, conducting IRT true score and observed score
		equating, and plotting item response curves/surfaces, vector
		plots, information plots, and comparison plots for examining
		parameter drift.
