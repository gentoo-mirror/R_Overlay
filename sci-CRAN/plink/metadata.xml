		IRT Separate Calibration Linking Methods // This package uses
		item response theory methods to compute linking constants and
		conduct chain linking of unidimensional or multidimensional
		tests for multiple groups under a common item design.  The
		unidimensional methods include the Mean/Mean, Mean/Sigma,
		Haebara, and Stocking-Lord methods for dichotomous (1PL, 2PL
		and 3PL) and/or polytomous (graded response, partial
		credit/generalized partial credit, nominal, and multiple-choice
		model) items.  The multidimensional methods include the least
		squares method and extensions of the Haebara and Stocking-Lord
		method using single or multiple dilation parameters for
		multidimensional extensions of all the unidimensional
		dichotomous and polytomous item response models.  The package
		also includes functions for importing item and/or ability
		parameters from common IRT software, conducting IRT true score
		and observed score equating, and plotting item response
		curves/surfaces, vector plots, and comparison plots for
		examining parameter drift.
