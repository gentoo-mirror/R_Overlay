		Automation and Standardization of Cleaning Clinical Laboratory
		Data // Navigating the shift of clinical laboratory data from
		primary everyday clinical use to secondary research purposes
		presents a significant challenge. Given the substantial time
		and expertise required for lab data pre-processing and cleaning
		and the lack of all-in-one tools tailored for this need, we
		developed our algorithm 'lab2clean' as an open-source
		R-package. 'lab2clean' package is set to automate and
		standardize the intricate process of cleaning clinical
		laboratory results. With a keen focus on improving the data
		quality of laboratory result values and units, our goal is to
		equip researchers with a straightforward, plug-and-play tool,
		making it smoother for them to unlock the true potential of
		clinical laboratory data in clinical research and clinical
		machine learning (ML) model development. Functions to clean
		validate result values (Version 1.0) are described in detail in
		'Zayed et al. (2024)' doi:10.1186/s12911-024-02652-7. Functions
		to standardize  harmonize result units (added in Version 2.0)
		are described in detail in 'Zayed et al. (2025)'
		doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.106131.
