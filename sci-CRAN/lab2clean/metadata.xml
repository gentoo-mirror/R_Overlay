		Automation and Standardization of Cleaning Clinical Lab Data //
		Navigating the shift of clinical laboratory data from primary
		everyday clinical use to secondary research purposes presents a
		significant challenge. Given the substantial time and expertise
		required for lab data pre-processing and cleaning and the lack
		of all-in-one tools tailored for this need, we developed our
		algorithm 'lab2clean' as an open-source R-package. 'lab2clean'
		package is set to automate and standardize the intricate
		process of cleaning clinical laboratory results. With a keen
		focus on improving the data quality of laboratory result
		values, our goal is to equip researchers with a
		straightforward, plug-and-play tool, making it smoother for
		them to unlock the true potential of clinical laboratory data
		in clinical research and clinical machine learning (ML) model
		development. Version 1.0 of the algorithm is described in
		detail in 'Zayed et al. (2024)' doi:10.1186/s12911-024-02652-7.
