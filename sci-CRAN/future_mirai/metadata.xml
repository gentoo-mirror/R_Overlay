		A 'Future' API for Parallel Processing using 'mirai' //
		Implementation of the 'Future' API doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048 on
		top of the 'mirai' package doi:10.5281/zenodo.7912722. By using
		this package, you get to take advantage of the benefits of
		'mirai' plus everything else that 'future' and the
		'Futureverse' adds on top of it. It allows you to process
		futures, as defined by the 'future' package, in parallel out of
		the box, on your local machine or across remote machines.
		Contrary to back-ends relying on the 'parallel' package (e.g.
		'multisession') and socket connections, 'mirai_cluster' and
		'mirai_multisession', provided here, can run more than 125
		parallel R processes. As a reminder, regardless which future
		backend is used by the user, the code does not have to change,
		it gives identical results, and behaves exactly the same.
