		Tools for Gaussian Process Modeling in Uncertainty Quantification
		// Gaussian processes ('GPs') have been widely used to model
		spatial data, 'spatio'-temporal data, and computer experiments
		in diverse areas of statistics including spatial statistics,
		'spatio'-temporal statistics, uncertainty quantification, and
		machine learning. This package creates basic tools for fitting
		and prediction based on 'GPs' with spatial data,
		'spatio'-temporal data, and computer experiments. Key
		characteristics for this GP tool include: (1) the comprehensive
		implementation of various covariance functions including the
		'Matrn' family and the Confluent 'Hypergeometric' family with
		isotropic form, tensor form, and automatic relevance
		determination form, where the isotropic form is widely used in
		spatial statistics, the tensor form is widely used in design
		and analysis of computer experiments and uncertainty
		quantification, and the automatic relevance determination form
		is widely used in machine learning; (2) implementations via
		Markov chain Monte Carlo ('MCMC') algorithms and optimization
		algorithms for GP models with all the implemented covariance
		functions. The methods for fitting and prediction are mainly
		implemented in a Bayesian framework; (3) model evaluation via
		Fisher information and predictive metrics such as predictive
		scores; (4) built-in functionality for simulating 'GPs' with
		all the implemented covariance functions; (5) unified
		implementation to allow easy specification of various 'GPs'.
