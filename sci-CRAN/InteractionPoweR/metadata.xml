		Power Analyses for Interaction Effects in Cross-Sectional
		Regressions // Power analysis for regression models which test
		the interaction of two or three independent variables on a
		single dependent variable. Includes options for correlated
		interacting variables and specifying variable reliability. Two-
		way interactions can include continuous, binary, or ordinal
		variables. Power analyses can be done either analytically or
		via simulation.  Includes tools for simulating single data sets
		and visualizing power analysis results. The primary functions
		are power_interaction_r2() and power_interaction() for two-way
		interactions, and power_interaction_3way_r2() for three-way
		interactions. Please cite as: Baranger DAA, Finsaas MC,
