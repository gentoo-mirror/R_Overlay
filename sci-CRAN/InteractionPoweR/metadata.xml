		Power Analyses for Interaction Effects in Cross-Sectional
		Regressions // Power analysis for regression models which test
		the interaction of two independent variables on a single
		dependent variable. Includes options for continuous, binary, or
		ordinal variables, as well as correlated interacting variables.
		Also includes options to specify variable reliability. Power
		analyses can be done either analytically or via simulation.
		Includes tools for simulating single data sets and visualizing
		power analysis results. The primary functions are
		power_interaction_r2() and power_interaction(). Please cite as:
