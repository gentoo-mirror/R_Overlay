		Fitting of Hydrotime Model for Seed Germination Time Course //
		The seed germination process starts with water uptake by the
		seed and ends with the protrusion of radicle and plumule under
		varying temperatures and soil water potential. Hydrotime is a
		way to describe the relationship between water potential and
		seed germination rates at germination percentages. One
		important quantity before applying hydrotime modeling of
		germination percentages is to consider the proportion of viable
		seeds that could germinate under saturated conditions. This
		package can be used to apply correction factors at various
		water potentials before estimating parameters like stress
		tolerance, and uniformity of the hydrotime model. Three
		different distributions namely, Gaussian, Logistic, and Extreme
		value distributions have been considered to fit the model to
		the seed germination time course. Details can be found in
		Bradford (2002) https://www.jstor.org/stable/4046371, and
		Bradford and Still(2004) https://www.jstor.org/stable/23433495.
