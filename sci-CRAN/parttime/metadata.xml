		Partial Datetime Handling // Datetimes and timestamps are
		invariably an imprecise notation, with any partial
		representation implying some amount of uncertainty. To handle
		this, 'parttime' provides classes for embedding partial
		missingness as a central part of its datetime classes. This
		central feature allows for more ergonomic use of datetimes for
		challenging datetime computation, including calculations of
		overlapping date ranges, imputations, and more thoughtful
		handling of ambiguity that arises from uncertain time zones.
		This package was developed first and foremost with
		pharmaceutical applications in mind, but aims to be agnostic to
		application to accommodate general use cases just as
		conveniently.
