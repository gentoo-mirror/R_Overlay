		Clustering Trajectories Anchored at Intervention Time // Clusters
		medical trajectories (unequally spaced and unequal length time
		series) aligned by an intervention time. Performs k-means
		clustering, where each mean is a thin plate spline fit to all
		points in a cluster. Distance is MSE across trajectory points
		to cluster spline. Provides silhouette plots and Adjusted Rand
		Index evaluations of the number of clusters. Scales well to
		large data with multicore parallelism available to speed
		computation.
