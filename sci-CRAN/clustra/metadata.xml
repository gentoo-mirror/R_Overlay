		Clustering Longitudinal Trajectories // Clusters longitudinal
		trajectories over time (can be unequally spaced, unequal length
		time series and/or partially overlapping series) on a common
		time axis. Performs k-means clustering on a single continuous
		variable measured over time, where each mean is defined by a
		thin plate spline fit to all points in a cluster. Distance is
		MSE across trajectory points to cluster spline. Provides graphs
		of derived cluster splines, silhouette plots, and Adjusted Rand
		Index evaluations of the number of clusters. Scales well to
		large data with multicore parallelism available to speed
		computation.
