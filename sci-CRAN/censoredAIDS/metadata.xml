		Estimation of Censored AI/QUAI Demand System via Maximum
		Likelihood Estimation (MLE) // Tools for estimating censored
		Almost Ideal (AI) and Quadratic Almost Ideal (QUAI) demand
		systems using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). It includes
		functions for calculating demand share equations and the
		truncated log-likelihood function for a system of equations,
		incorporating demographic variables. The package is designed to
		handle censored data, where some observations may be zero due
		to non-purchase of certain goods. Package also contains a
		procedure to approximate demand elasticities numerically and
		estimate standard errors via Delta Method. It is particularly
		useful for applied researchers analyzing household consumption
		data.
