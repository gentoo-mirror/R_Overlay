		Estimation of Censored AI/QUAI Demand System via Maximum
		Likelihood Estimation (MLE) // Tools for estimating censored
		Almost Ideal (AI) and Quadratic Almost Ideal (QUAI) demand
		systems using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). It includes
		functions for calculating demand share equations and the
		truncated log-likelihood function for a system of equations,
		incorporating demographic variables. The package is designed to
		handle censored data, where some observations may be zero due
		to non-purchase of certain goods. It is particularly useful for
		applied researchers analyzing household consumption data.
