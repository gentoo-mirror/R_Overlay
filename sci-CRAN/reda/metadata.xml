		Recurrent Event Data Analysis // Contains implementations of
		recurrent event data analysis routines including (1) survival
		and recurrent event data simulation from stochastic process
		point of view by the thinning method proposed by Lewis and
		Shedler (1979) doi:10.1002/nav.3800260304 and the inversion
		method introduced in Cinlar (1975, ISBN:978-0486497976), (2)
		the mean cumulative function (MCF) estimation by the Nelson-
		Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard rate function, (3)
		two-sample recurrent event responses comparison with the
		pseudo-score tests proposed by Lawless and Nadeau (1995)
		doi:10.2307/1269617, (4) gamma frailty model with spline rate
		function following Fu, et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1080/10543406.2014.992524.
