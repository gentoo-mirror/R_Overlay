		Optimization Frameworks for Tie-Oriented and Actor-Oriented
		Relational Event Models // A comprehensive set of tools
		designed for optimizing likelihood within a tie-oriented
		(Butts, C., 2008, doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x) or an
		actor-oriented modelling framework (Stadtfeld, C.,  Block, P.,
		2017, doi:10.15195/v4.a14) in relational event networks. The
		package accommodates both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.
		The frequentist approaches that the package incorporates are
		the Maximum Likelihood Optimization (MLE) and the Gradient-
		based Optimization  (GDADAMAX). The Bayesian methodologies
		included in the package are the Bayesian Sampling Importance
		Resampling (BSIR) and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). The
		flexibility of choosing between frequentist and Bayesian
		optimization approaches allows researchers to select the
		estimation approach which aligns the most with their analytical
		preferences.
