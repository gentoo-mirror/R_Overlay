		Exploratory Graphics for Pharmacometrics // Supports a structured
		approach for exploring PKPD data
		https://opensource.nibr.com/xgx/. It also contains helper
		functions for enabling the modeler to follow best R practices
		(by appending the program name, figure name location, and draft
		status to each plot). In addition, it enables the modeler to
		follow best graphical practices (by providing a theme that
		reduces chart ink, and by providing time-scale, log-scale, and
		reverse-log-transform-scale functions for more readable axes).
		Finally, it provides some data checking and summarizing
		functions for rapidly exploring pharmacokinetics and
		pharmacodynamics (PKPD) datasets.
