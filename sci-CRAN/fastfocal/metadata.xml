		Fast Multiscale Raster Extraction and Moving Window Analysis with
		FFT // Provides fast moving-window ("focal") and buffer-based
		extraction for raster data using the 'terra' package.
		Automatically selects between a 'C++' backend (via 'terra') and
		a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) backend depending on problem
		size. The FFT backend supports sum and mean, while other
		statistics (e.g., median, min, max, standard deviation) are
		handled by the 'terra' backend. Supports multiple kernel types
		(e.g., circle, rectangle, gaussian), with NA handling
		consistent with 'terra' via 'na.rm' and 'na.policy'. Operates
		on 'SpatRaster' objects and returns results with the same
		geometry.
