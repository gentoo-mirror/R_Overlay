		Hardware-Accelerated Rerandomization for Improved Balance //
		Provides hardware-accelerated tools for performing
		rerandomization and randomization testing in experimental
		research. Using a 'JAX' backend, the package enables exact
		rerandomization inference even for large experiments with
		hundreds of billions of possible randomizations. Key
		functionalities include generating pools of acceptable
		rerandomizations based on covariate balance, conducting exact
		randomization tests, and performing pre-analysis evaluations to
		determine optimal rerandomization acceptance thresholds. The
		package supports various hardware acceleration frameworks
		including 'CPU', 'CUDA', and 'METAL', making it versatile
		across accelerated computing environments. This allows
		researchers to efficiently implement stringent rerandomization
		designs and conduct valid inference even with large sample
		sizes. The package is partly based on Jerzak and Goldstein
		(2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.00861.
