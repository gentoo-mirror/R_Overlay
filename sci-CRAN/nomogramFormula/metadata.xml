		Calculate Total Points and Probabilities for Nomogram // A
		nomogram, which can be carried out in 'rms' package, provides a
		graphical explanation of a prediction process. However, it is
		not very easy to draw straight lines, read points and
		probabilities accurately. Even, it is hard for users to
		calculate total points and probabilities for all subjects. This
		package provides formula_rd() and formula_lp() functions to fit
		the formula of total points with raw data and linear predictors
		respectively by polynomial regression. Function points_cal()
		will help you calculate the total points. prob_cal() can be
		used to calculate the probabilities after lrm(), cph() or psm()
		regression.
