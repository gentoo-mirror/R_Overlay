		Bayesian Weighted Sums // An interface to the Bayesian Weighted
		Sums model implemented in 'RStan'. It estimates the summed
		effect of multiple, often moderately to highly correlated,
		continuous predictors. Its applications can be found in
		analysis of exposure mixtures. The model was proposed by Hamra,
		Maclehose, Croen, Kauffman, and Newschaffer (2021)
		doi:10.3390/ijerph18041373. This implementation includes an
		extension to model binary outcome.
