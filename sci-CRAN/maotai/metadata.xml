		Tools for Matrix Algebra, Optimization and Inference // Matrix is
		an universal and sometimes primary object/unit in applied
		mathematics and statistics. We provide a number of algorithms
		for selected problems in optimization and statistical
		inference. For general exposition to the topic with focus on
		statistical context, see the book by Banerjee and Roy (2014,
		ISBN:9781420095388).
