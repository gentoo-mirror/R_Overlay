		The Multivariate Normal and t Distributions, and Their Truncated
		Versions // Functions are provided for computing the density
		and the distribution function of d-dimensional normal and "t"
		random variables, possibly truncated (on one side or two sides,
		with componentwise choice), and for generating random vectors
		sampled from these distributions, except sampling from the
		truncated "t". Moments of arbitrary order of a truncated normal
		are computed, and converted to cumulants up to order 4.
		Probabilities are computed via non-Monte Carlo methods;
		different routines are used in the case d=1, d=2, d=3, d2, if d
		denotes the dimensionality.
