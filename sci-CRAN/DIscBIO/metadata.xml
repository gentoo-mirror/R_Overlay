		A User-Friendly Pipeline for Biomarker Discovery in Single-Cell
		Transcriptomics // An open, multi-algorithmic pipeline for
		easy, fast and efficient analysis of cellular sub-populations
		and the molecular signatures that characterize them. The
		pipeline consists of four successive steps: data pre-
		processing, cellular clustering with pseudo-temporal ordering,
		defining differential expressed genes and biomarker
		identification. This package implements extensions of the work
		published by Ghannoum et. al. (2019) doi:10.1101/700989.
