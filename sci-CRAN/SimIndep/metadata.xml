		WISE: a Weighted Similarity Aggregation Test for Serial
		Independence // A fast implementation of the weighted
		information similarity aggregation (WISE) test for detecting
		serial dependence, particularly suited for high-dimensional and
		non-Euclidean time series. Includes functions for constructing
		similarity matrices and conducting hypothesis testing. Users
		can use different similarity measures and define their own
		weighting schemes. For more details see Q Zhu, M Liu, Y Han, D
		Zhou (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2509.05678.
