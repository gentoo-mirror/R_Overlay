		Image Processing for Simulated Cameras // Uses convolution-based
		techniques to generate simulated camera bokeh, depth of field,
		and other camera effects, using an image and an optional depth
		map. Accepts both filename inputs and in-memory array
		representations of images and matrices. Includes functions to
		perform 2D convolutions, reorient and resize images/matrices,
		add image overlays, generate camera vignette effects, and add
		titles to images.
