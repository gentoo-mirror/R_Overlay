		Spatially Automatic Denoising for Imaging Mass Spectrometry
		Toolkit // Set of tools for peak filtering of mass spectrometry
		imaging data based on spatial distribution of signal. Given a
		region-of-interest, representing the spatial region where the
		informative signal is expected to be localized, a series of
		filters determine which peak signals are characterized by an
		implausible spatial distribution. The filters reduce the
		dataset dimension and increase its information vs noise ratio,
		improving the quality of the unsupervised analysis results,
		reducing data dimension and simplifying the chemical
		interpretation. The methods are described in Inglese P. et al
		(2019) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty622.
