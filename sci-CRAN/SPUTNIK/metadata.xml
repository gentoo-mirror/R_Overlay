		SPatially aUTomatic deNoising for Ims toolKit // A set of tools
		for the peak filtering of mass spectrometry imaging data (MSI
		or IMS) based on spatial distribution of signal. Given a
		region-of-interest (ROI), representing the spatial region where
		the informative signal is expected to be localized, a series of
		filters determine which peak signals are characterized by an
		implausible spatial distribution. The filters reduce the
		dataset dimensionality and increase its information vs noise
		ratio, improving the quality of the unsupervised analysis
		results, reducing data dimensionality and simplifying the
		chemical interpretation.
