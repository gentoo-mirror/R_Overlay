		Development Utilities for R Packages // Provides some low-level
		utilities to use for package development. It currently provides
		managers for multiple package specific options and registries,
		vignette, unit test and bibtex related utilities. It serves as
		a base package for packages like NMF, RcppOctave, doRNG, and as
		an incubator package for other general purposes utilities, that
		will eventually be packaged separately. It is still under heavy
		development and changes in the interface(s) are more than
		likely to happen.
