		'RStudio' Addins to Simplify 'Markdown' Writing // An 'RStudio'
		addin providing shortcuts for writing in 'Markdown'. This
		package provides a series of functions that allow the user to
		be more efficient when using 'Markdown'. For example, you can
		select a word, and put it in bold or in italics, or change the
		alignment of elements inside you Rmd. The idea is to map all
		the functionalities from 'remedy' on keyboard shortcuts, so
		that it provides an interface close to what you can find in any
		other text editor.
