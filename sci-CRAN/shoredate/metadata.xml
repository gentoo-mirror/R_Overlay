		Shoreline Dating of Stone Age Sites on the Norwegian Skagerrak
		Coast // Provides tools for shoreline dating Stone Age sites
		located on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast using methods
		presented in Roalkvam (2023)
		doi:10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107880. Shoreline dating is based
		on the present-day elevation of a site, a reconstruction of
		past relative sea-level change, and empirically derived
		estimates of the likely elevation of the sites above sea-level
		when they were in use. The geographical and temporal coverage
		of the method thus follows from local geological
		reconstructions of shoreline displacement and the degree to
		which settlements in the region have been found to have been
		located on or close to the shoreline when they were in use.
		Methods for numerical treatment and visualisation of the dates
		are provided, along with basic tools for evaluating the
		location of sites within the region and corresponding variation
		in local shoreline displacement.
