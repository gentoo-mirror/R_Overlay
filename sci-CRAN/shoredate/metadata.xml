		Shoreline Dating Coastal Stone Age Sites // Provides tools for
		shoreline dating coastal Stone Age sites. The implemented
		method was developed in Roalkvam (2023)
		doi:10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107880 for the Norwegian Skagerrak
		coast. Although it can be extended to other areas, this also
		forms the core area for application of the package. Shoreline
		dating is based on the present-day elevation of a site, a
		reconstruction of past relative sea-level change, and
		empirically derived estimates of the likely elevation of the
		sites above the contemporaneous sea-level when they were in
		use. The geographical and temporal coverage of the method thus
		follows from the availability of local geological
		reconstructions of shoreline displacement and the degree to
		which the settlements to be dated have been located on or close
		to the shoreline when they were in use. Methods for numerical
		treatment and visualisation of the dates are provided, along
		with basic tools for visualising and evaluating the location of
		sites.
