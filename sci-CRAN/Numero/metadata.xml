		Statistical Framework to Define Subgroups in Complex Datasets //
		High-dimensional datasets that do not exhibit a clear intrinsic
		clustered structure pose a challenge to conventional clustering
		algorithms. For this reason, we developed an unsupervised
		framework that helps scientists to better subgroup their
		datasets based on visual cues, please see Gao S, Mutter S,
		Casey A, Makinen V-P (2018) Numero: a statistical framework to
		define multivariable subgroups in complex population-based
		datasets, Int J Epidemiology, dyy113, doi:10.1093/ije/dyy113.
		The framework includes the necessary functions to construct a
		self-organizing map of the data, to evaluate the statistical
		significance of the observed data patterns, and to visualize
		the results.
