		Statistical Framework to Define Subgroups in Complex Datasets //
		High-dimensional datasets that do not exhibit a clear intrinsic
		clustered structure pose a challenge to conventional clustering
		algorithms. For this reason, we developed an unsupervised
		framework that helps scientists to better subgroup their
		datasets based on visual cues [Makinen V-P et al. (2011) J
		Proteome Res 11:1782-1790, doi:10.1021/pr201036j]. The
		framework includes the necessary functions to import large data
		files, to construct a self-organizing map of the data, to
		evaluate the statistical significance of the observed data
		patterns, and to visualize the results in scalable vector
		graphics.
