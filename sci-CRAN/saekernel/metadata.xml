		Small Area Estimation Non-Parametric Based Nadaraya-Watson Kernel
		// Propose an area-level, non-parametric regression estimator
		based on Nadaraya-Watson kernel on small area mean. Adopt a
		two-stage estimation approach proposed by Prasad and Rao
		(1990). Mean Squared Error (MSE) estimators are not readily
		available, so resampling method that called bootstrap is
		applied. This package are based on the model proposed in Two
		stage non-parametric approach for small area estimation by
		Pushpal Mukhopadhyay and Tapabrata Maiti(2004) http://www.asasr
		ms.org/Proceedings/y2004/files/Jsm2004-000737.pdf.
