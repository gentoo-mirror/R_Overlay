		Scalable Bayesian Rule Lists Model // An efficient implementation
		of Scalable Bayesian Rule Lists Algorithm, a competitor
		algorithm for decision tree algorithms; see Hongyu Yang,
		Cynthia Rudin, Margo Seltzer (2017)
		https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/yang17h.html. It builds from
		pre-mined association rules and have a logical structure
		identical to a decision list or one-sided decision tree. Fully
		optimized over rule lists, this algorithm strikes practical
		balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational
		speed.
