		Multiple Empirical Likelihood Tests // Performs multiple
		empirical likelihood tests. It offers an easy-to-use interface
		and flexibility in specifying hypotheses and calibration
		methods, extending the framework to simultaneous inferences.
		The core computational routines are implemented using the
		'Eigen' 'C++' library and 'RcppEigen' interface, with 'OpenMP'
		for parallel computation.  Details of the testing procedures
		are provided in Kim, MacEachern, and Peruggia (2023)
		doi:10.1080/10485252.2023.2206919. A companion paper by Kim,
		MacEachern, and Peruggia (2024) doi:10.18637/jss.v108.i05 is
		available for further information. This work was supported by
		the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants No.
