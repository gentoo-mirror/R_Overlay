		Multiple Empirical Likelihood Tests // Performs multiple
		empirical likelihood tests for regression analysis. Much of its
		functionality and syntax mimics the corresponding base R
		functions. The core computational routines are implemented
		using the 'Eigen' C++ library and 'RcppEigen' interface, with
		OpenMP for parallel computation. Additional functions are
		available for multiple testing for the analysis of experimental
		designs. Details of the testing procedures are given in Kim et
		al. (2021) arxiv:2112.09206.
