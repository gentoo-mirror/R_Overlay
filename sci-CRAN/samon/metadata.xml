		Sensitivity Analysis for Missing Data // In a clinical trial with
		repeated measures designs, outcomes are often taken from
		subjects at fixed time-points.  The focus of the trial may be
		to compare the mean outcome in two or more groups at some pre-
		specified time after enrollment. In the presence of missing
		data auxiliary assumptions are necessary to perform such
		comparisons.  One commonly employed assumption is the missing
		at random assumption (MAR).   The 'samon' package allows the
		user to perform a (parameterized) sensitivity analysis of this
		assumption.  In particular it can be used to examine the
		sensitivity of tests in the difference in outcomes to
		violations of the MAR assumption.  The sensitivity analysis can
		be performed under two scenarios, a) where the data exhibit a
		monotone missing data pattern (see the samon() function), and,
		b) where in addition to a monotone missing data pattern the
		data exhibit intermittent missing values (see the samonIM()
		function).
