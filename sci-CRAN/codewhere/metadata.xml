		Find the Location of an R Package's Code // Find the location of
		the code for an R package based on the package's name or string
		representation. Checks on 'CRAN' based on information in the
		'URL' field or 'BioConductor' and 'GitHub' based on
		constructing a URL, and verifies all paths via testing for a
		successful response. This can be useful when automating static
		code analysis based on a list of package names, and similar
		tasks.
