		Simulation of Evolution of Enzyme Under Constraints // Simulate
		the evolution of enzyme concentrations under selection for
		increased flux in a metabolic pathway, with cellular
		constraints. Create graphics for the simulation results.
		Compute evolutionary equilibrium and Range of Neutral
		Variations of enzyme concentrations. This package is part of
		"Coton, C., Talbot, G., Le Louarn, M., Dillmann, C., de Vienne,
		D. (2021) bioRxiv:10.1101/2021.05.04.442631". Version 2.0.0 and
		more takes account of regulation groups, and is part of a
		second article "Coton, C., Dillmann, C., de Vienne, D. (in
		progress)".
