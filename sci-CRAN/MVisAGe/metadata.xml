		Compute and Visualize Bivariate Associations // Pearson and
		Spearman correlation coefficients are commonly used to quantify
		the strength of bivariate associations of genomic variables.
		For example, correlations of gene-level DNA copy number and
		gene expression measurements may be used to assess the impact
		of DNA copy number changes on gene expression in tumor tissue.
		'MVisAGe' enables users to quickly compute and visualize the
		correlations in order to assess the effect of regional genomic
		events such as changes in DNA copy number or DNA methylation
		level.  Please see Walter V, Du Y, Danilova L, Hayward MC,
