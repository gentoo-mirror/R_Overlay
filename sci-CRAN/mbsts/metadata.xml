		Multivariate Bayesian Structural Time Series // Tools for data
		analysis with multivariate Bayesian structural time series
		(MBSTS) models.  Specifically, the package provides facilities
		for implementing general structural time series models,
		flexibly adding on different time series components (trend,
		season, cycle, and regression), simulating them, fitting them
		to multivariate correlated time series data, conducting feature
		selection on the regression component.
