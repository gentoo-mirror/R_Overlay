		Quantile Regression // Estimation and inference methods for
		models of conditional quantiles: Linear and nonlinear
		parametric and non-parametric (total variation penalized)
		models for conditional quantiles of a univariate response and
		several methods for handling censored survival data.  Portfolio
		selection methods based on expected shortfall risk are also now
		included. See Koenker (2006) doi:10.1017/CBO9780511754098 and
