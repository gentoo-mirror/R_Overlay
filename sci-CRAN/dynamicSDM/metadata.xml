		Species Distribution and Abundance Modelling at High Spatio-
		Temporal Resolution // A collection of novel tools for
		generating species distribution and abundance models (SDM) that
		are dynamic through both space and time. These highly flexible
		functions incorporate spatial and temporal aspects across key
		SDM stages; including when cleaning and filtering species
		occurrence data, generating pseudo-absence records, assessing
		and correcting sampling biases and autocorrelation, extracting
		explanatory variables and projecting distribution patterns.
		Throughout, functions utilise Google Earth Engine and Google
		Drive to minimise the computing power and storage demands
		associated with species distribution modelling at high spatio-
		temporal resolution.
