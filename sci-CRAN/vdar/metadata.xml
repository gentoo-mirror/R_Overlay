		Discriminant Analysis Incorporating Individual Uncertainties //
		The qda() function from package 'MASS' is extended to calculate
		a weighted linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis
		(QDA) by changing the group variances and group means based on
		cell-wise uncertainties. The uncertainties can be derived e.g.
		through relative errors for each individual measurement (cell),
		not only row-wise or column-wise uncertainties. The method can
		be applied compositional data (e.g. portions of substances,
		concentrations) and non-compositional data.
