		Functions and Data for the Book "Applied Nonparametric
		Statistical Methods", 5th Edition // Functions and data to
		accompany the 5th edition of the book "Applied Nonparametric
		Statistical Methods" (4th edition: Sprent  Smeeton, 2024,
		ISBN:158488701X), the revisions from the 4th edition including
		a move from describing the output from a miscellany of
		statistical software packages to using R. While the output from
		many of the functions can also be obtained using a range of
		other R functions, this package provides functions in a unified
		setting and give output using both p-values and confidence
		intervals, exemplifying the book's approach of treating
		p-values as a guide to statistical importance and not an end
		product in their own right.
