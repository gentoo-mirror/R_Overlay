		Plot Multiple Sequence Alignment using 'ggplot2' // Supports
		visualizing multiple sequence alignment of DNA and protein
		sequences using 'ggplot2'. It supports a number of colour
		schemes, including Chemistry, Clustal, Shapely, Taylor and
		Zappo. Multiple sequence alignment can easily be combined with
		other 'ggplot2' plots, such as aligning a phylogenetic tree
		produced by 'ggtree' with multiple sequence alignment.
