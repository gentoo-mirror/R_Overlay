		PPS Sampling // Functions to select samples using PPS
		(probability proportional to size) sampling. The package also
		includes a function for stratified simple random sampling, a
		function to compute joint inclusion probabilities for
		Sampford's method of PPS sampling, and a few utility functions.
		The user's guide pps-ug.pdf is included in the .../pps/doc
		directory. The methods are described in standard survey
		sampling theory books such as Cochran's "Sampling Techniques";
		see the user's guide for references.
