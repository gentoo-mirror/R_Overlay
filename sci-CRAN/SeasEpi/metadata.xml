		Spatiotemporal Modeling of Seasonal Infectious Disease //
		Spatiotemporal individual-level model of seasonal infectious
		disease transmission within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-
		Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) framework are applied to model
		seasonal infectious disease transmission. This package employs
		a likelihood based Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional
		Maximization (MCECM) algorithm for estimating model parameters.
		In addition to model fitting and parameter estimation, the
		package offers functions for calculating AIC using real
		pandemic data and conducting simulation studies customized to
		user-specified model configurations.
