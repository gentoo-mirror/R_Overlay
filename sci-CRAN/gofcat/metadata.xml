		Goodness-of-Fit Measures for Categorical Response Models // A
		post-estimation method for categorical response models (CRM).
		Inputs from objects of class serp(), clm(), polr(), multinom(),
		mlogit(), vglm() and glm() are currently supported. Available
		tests include the Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for the binary,
		multinomial and ordinal logistic regression; the Lipsitz and
		the Pulkstenis-Robinson tests for the ordinal models. The
		proportional odds, adjacent-category, and constrained
		continuation-ratio models are particularly supported at ordinal
		level. Tests for the proportional odds assumptions in ordinal
		models are also possible with the Brant and the Likelihood-
		Ratio tests. Moreover, several summary measures of predictive
		strength (Pseudo R-squared), and some useful error metrics,
		including, the brier score, misclassification rate and logloss
		are also available for the binary, multinomial and ordinal
		models. Ugba, E. R. and Gertheiss, J. (2018)
