		Ratios of Coefficients in the General Linear Model // Performs
		(simultaneous) inferences for ratios of linear combinations of
		coefficients in the general linear model. Multiple comparisons
		and simultaneous confidence interval estimations can be
		performed for ratios of treatment means in the normal one-way
		layout with homogeneous and heterogeneous treatment variances,
		according to Dilba et al. (2007)
		https://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2007-1.pdf and
		Hasler and Hothorn (2008) doi:10.1002/bimj.200710466.
		Confidence interval estimations for ratios of linear
		combinations of linear model parameters like in (multiple)
		slope ratio and parallel line assays can be carried out.
		Moreover, it is possible to calculate the sample sizes required
		in comparisons with a control based on relative margins. For
		the simple two-sample problem, functions for a t-test for
		ratio-formatted hypotheses and the corresponding confidence
		interval are provided assuming homogeneous or heterogeneous
		group variances.
