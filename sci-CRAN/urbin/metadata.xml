		Unifying Estimation Results with Binary Dependent Variables //
		Calculate unified measures that quantify the effect of a
		covariate on a binary dependent variable (e.g., for meta-
		analyses). This can be particularly important if the estimation
		results are obtained with different models/estimators (e.g.,
		linear probability model, logit, probit, ...) and/or with
		different transformations of the explanatory variable of
		interest (e.g., linear, quadratic, interval-coded, ...). The
		calculated unified measures are: (a) semi-elasticities of
		linear, quadratic, or interval-coded covariates and (b) effects
		of linear, quadratic, interval-coded, or categorical covariates
		when a linear or quadratic covariate changes between distinct
		intervals, the reference category of a categorical variable or
		the reference interval of an interval-coded variable needs to
		be changed, or some categories of a categorical covariate or
		some intervals of an interval-coded covariate need to be
		grouped together. Approximate standard errors of the unified
		measures are also calculated. All methods that are implemented
		in this package are described in the 'vignette' "Extracting and
		Unifying Semi-Elasticities and Effect Sizes from Studies with
		Binary Dependent Variables" that is included in this package.
