		An R-GUI for Spatial Analysis of Surface Runoff using the NRCS-CN
		Method // A Graphical user interface to calculate the rainfall-
		runoff relation using the Natural Resources Conservation
		Service - Curve Number method (NRCS-CN method) but include
		modifications by Hawkins et al., (2002) about the Initial
		Abstraction. This GUI follows the programming logic of a
		previously published software (Hernandez-Guzman et al.,
		2011)doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.07.006. It is a raster-based
		GIS tool that outputs runoff estimates from Land use/land cover
		and hydrologic soil group maps. This package has already been
		published in Journal of Hydroinformatics (Hernandez-Guzman et
		al., 2021)doi:10.2166/hydro.2020.087 but it is under constant
		development at the Institute about Natural Resources Research
		(INIRENA) from the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de
		Hidalgo and represents a collaborative effort between the
		Hydro-Geomatic Lab (INIRENA) with the Environmental Management
		Lab (CIAD, A.C.).
