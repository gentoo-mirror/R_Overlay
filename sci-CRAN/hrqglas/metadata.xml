		Group Variable Selection for Quantile and Robust Mean Regression
		// A program that conducts group variable selection for
		quantile and robust mean regression (Sherwood and Li, 2022).
		The group lasso penalty (Yuan and Lin, 2006) is used for group-
		wise variable selection. Both of the quantile and mean
		regression models are based on the Huber loss. Specifically,
		with the tuning parameter in the Huber loss approaching to 0,
		the quantile check function can be approximated by the Huber
		loss for the median and the tilted version of Huber loss at
		other quantiles. Such approximation provides computational
		efficiency and stability, and has also been shown to be
		statistical consistent.
