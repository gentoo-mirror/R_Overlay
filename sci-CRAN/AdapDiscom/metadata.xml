		Adaptive Sparse Regression for Block Missing Multimodal Data //
		Provides adaptive direct sparse regression for high-dimensional
		multimodal data with heterogeneous missing patterns and
		measurement errors. 'AdapDISCOM' extends the 'DISCOM' framework
		with modality-specific adaptive weighting to handle varying
		data structures and error magnitudes across blocks. The method
		supports flexible block configurations (any K blocks) and
		includes robust variants for heavy-tailed distributions
		('AdapDISCOM'-Huber) and fast implementations for large-scale
		applications (Fast-'AdapDISCOM'). Designed for realistic
		multimodal scenarios where different data sources exhibit
		distinct missing data patterns and contamination levels. Diakit
		et al. (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2508.00120.
