		Bayesian Estimation of Intervention Effects // An implementation
		of intervention effect estimation for DAGs (directed acyclic
		graphs) learned from binary data. First, parameters are
		estimated or sampled for the DAG and then interventions on each
		node (variable) are propagated through the network (do-
		calculus). Both exact computation (up to around 20 variables)
		and Monte Carlo schemes (for larger networks) are implemented.
