		Bayesian Estimation of Intervention Effects // An implementation
		of intervention effect estimation for DAGs (directed acyclic
		graphs) learned from binary or continuous data. First,
		parameters are estimated or sampled for the DAG and then
		interventions on each node (variable) are propagated through
		the network (do-calculus). Both exact computation (for
		continuous data or for binary data up to around 20 variables)
		and Monte Carlo schemes (for larger binary networks) are
		implemented.
