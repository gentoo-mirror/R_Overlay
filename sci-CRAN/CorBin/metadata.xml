		Generate High-Dimensional Binary Data with Correlation Structures
		// We design algorithms with linear time complexity with
		respect to the dimension for three commonly studied correlation
		structures, including exchangeable, decaying-product and
		K-dependent correlation structures, and extend the algorithms
		to generate binary data of general non-negative correlation
		matrices with quadratic time complexity. Jiang, W., Song, S.,
		Hou, L. and Zhao, H. "A set of efficient methods to generate
		high-dimensional binary data with specified correlation
		structures." The American Statistician. See
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2020.1816213 for a detailed presentation
		of the method.
