		Analyzing Categorical Time Series // An implementation of several
		functions for feature extraction in categorical time series
		datasets. Specifically, some features related to marginal
		distributions and serial dependence patterns can be computed.
		These features can be used to feed clustering and
		classification algorithms for categorical time series, among
		others. The package also includes some interesting datasets
		containing biological sequences. Practitioners from a broad
		variety of fields could benefit from the general framework
		provided by 'ctsfeatures'.
