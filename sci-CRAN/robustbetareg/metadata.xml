		Robust Beta Regression // Robust estimators for the beta
		regression, useful for modeling bounded continuous data.
		Currently, four types of robust estimators are supported. They
		depend on a tuning constant which may be fixed or selected by a
		data-driven algorithm also implemented in the package.
		Diagnostic tools associated with the fitted model, such as the
		residuals and goodness-of-fit statistics, are implemented.
		Robust Wald-type tests are available. More details about robust
		beta regression are described in Maluf et al. (2025)
