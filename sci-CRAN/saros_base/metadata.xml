		Base Tools for Semi-Automatic Reporting of Ordinary Surveys //
		Scaffold an entire web-based report using template chunks,
		based on a small chapter overview and a dataset. Highly
		adaptable with prefixes, suffixes, translations, etc. Also
		contains tools for password-protecting, e.g. for each
		organization's report on a website. Developed for the common
		case of a survey across multiple organizations/sites where each
		organization wants to obtain results for their organization
		compared with everyone else. See 'saros'
		(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=saros) for tools used for
		authors in the drafted reports.
