		Variational Techniques in Epidemiology // Using variational
		techniques we address some epidemiological problems as the
		incidence curve decomposition by inverting the renewal equation
		as described in Alvarez et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.2105112118 and Alvarez et al. (2022)
		doi:10.3390/biology11040540 or the estimation of the functional
		relationship between epidemiological indicators. We also
		propose a learning method for the short time forecast of the
		trend incidence curve  as described in Morel et al. (2022)
