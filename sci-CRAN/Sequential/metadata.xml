		Exact Sequential Analysis for Poisson and Binomial Data //
		Functions to calculate exact critical values, statistical
		power, expected time to signal, and required sample sizes for
		performing exact sequential analysis. All these
		calculations can be done for either Poisson or binomial data,
		for continuous or group sequential analyses, and for different
		types of rejection boundaries. In case of group sequential
		analyses, the group sizes do not have to be specified in
		advance and the alpha spending can be arbitrarily settled. For
		regression versions of the methods, Monte Carlo and asymptotic
		methods are used.
