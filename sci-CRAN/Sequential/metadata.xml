		Exact Sequential Analysis for Poisson and Binomial Data //
		Functions to calculate exact critical values, statistical
		power, expected time to                            signal and
		required  sample sizes for  performing exact sequential
		analysis. All these                         calculations can be
		done for either Poisson or binomial data, for continuous  or
		group                          sequential analyses, and for
		different types of rejection boundaries.  In case  of group
		sequential  analyses, the group  sizes do not  have to be
		specified in advance and the                          alpha
		spending can be arbitrarily settled.
