		Modelling Dependence with Multivariate Archimax (or any User-
		Defined Continuous) Copulas // Archimax copulas are mixture of
		Archimedean and EV copulas. The package provides definitions of
		several parametric families of generator and dependence
		function, computes CDF and PDF, estimates parameters, tests for
		goodness of fit, generates random sample and checks copula
		properties for custom constructs. In 2-dimensional case
		explicit formulas for density are used, in the contrary to
		higher dimensions when all derivatives are linearly
		approximated. Several non-archimax families (normal, FGM,
		Plackett) are provided as well.
