		A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Integrating Additional
		Knowledge in Learning Multiple Related Sparse Gaussian
		Graphical Models // Provides a fast and scalable joint
		estimator for integrating additional knowledge in learning
		multiple related sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (JEEK). The
		JEEK algorithm can be used to fast estimate multiple related
		precision matrices in a large-scale. For instance, it can
		identify multiple gene networks from multi-context gene
		expression datasets. By performing data-driven network
		inference from high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets,
		this tool can help users effectively translate aggregated data
		into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities.
		Please run demo(jeek) to learn the basic functions provided by
		this package. For further details, please read the original
		paper: Beilun Wang, Arshdeep Sekhon, Yanjun Qi "A Fast and
		Scalable Joint Estimator for Integrating Additional Knowledge
		in Learning Multiple Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models"
		(ICML 2018) arXiv:1806.00548.
