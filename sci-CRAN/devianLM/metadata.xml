		Detecting Extremal Values in a Normal Linear Model // Provides a
		method to detect values poorly explained by a Gaussian linear
		model. The procedure is based on the maximum of the absolute
		value of the studentized residuals, which is a parameter-free
		statistic. This approach generalizes several procedures used to
		detect abnormal values during longitudinal monitoring of
		biological markers. For methodological details, see: Berthelot
		G., Saulire G., Dedecker J. (2025). "DEViaN-LM An R Package for
		Detecting Abnormal Values in the Gaussian Linear Model". HAL
