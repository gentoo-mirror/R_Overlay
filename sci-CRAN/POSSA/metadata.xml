		Power Simulation for Sequential Analyses and Multiple Hypotheses
		// Calculates, via simulation, power and appropriate stopping
		alpha boundaries (and/or futility bounds) for sequential
		analyses (i.e., group sequential design) as well as for
		multiple hypotheses (multiple tests included in an analysis),
		given any specified global error rate. This enables the
		sequential use of practically any significance test, as long as
		the underlying data can be simulated in advance to a reasonable
		approximation. Lukcs (2022) doi:10.21105/joss.04643.
