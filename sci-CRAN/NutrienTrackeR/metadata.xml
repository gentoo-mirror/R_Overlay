		Food Composition Information and Dietary Assessment // Provides a
		tool set for food information and dietary assessment. It uses
		food composition data from several reference databases,
		including: 'USDA' (United States), 'CIQUAL' (France), 'BEDCA'
		(Spain) and 'CNF' (Canada). 'NutrienTrackeR' calculates the
		intake levels for both macronutrient and micronutrients, and
		compares them with the recommended dietary allowances (RDA). It
		includes a number of visualization tools, such as time series
		plots of nutrient intake, and pie-charts showing the main foods
		contributing to the intake level of a given nutrient. A shiny
		app exposing the main functionalities of the package is also
		provided.
