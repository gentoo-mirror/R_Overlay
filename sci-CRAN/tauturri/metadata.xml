		Get Data Out of 'Tautulli' (Formerly 'PlexPy') // 'Tautulli'
		(http://tautulli.com) is a monitoring application for 'Plex'
		Media Servers (https://www.plex.tv) which collects a lot of
		data about media items and server usage such as play counts.
		This package interacts with the 'Tautulli' API of any specified
		server to get said data into R. The 'Tautulli' API
		documentation is available at
		https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/blob/master/API.md.
