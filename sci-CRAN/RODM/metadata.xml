		R interface to Oracle Data Mining // This package implements an
		interface to Oracle Data Mining (ODM). It provides an ideal
		environment for rapid development of demos and proof of concept
		data mining studies. It facilitates the prototyping of vertical
		applications and makes ODM and the RDBMS environment easily
		accessible to statisticians and data analysts familiar with R
		but not fluent in SQL or familiar with the database
		environment. It also facilitates the benchmarking and testing
		of ODM functionality including the production of summary
		statistics, performance metrics and graphics. It enables the
		scripting and control of production data mining methodologies
		from a high-level environment. Oracle Data Mining (ODM) is an
		option of Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
		Enterprise Edition (EE). It contains several data mining and
		data analysis algorithms for classification, prediction,
		regression, clustering, associations, feature selection,
		anomaly detection, feature extraction, and specialized
		analytics. It provides means for the creation, management and
		operational deployment of data mining models inside the
		database environment. For more information consult the entry
		for "Oracle Data Mining" in Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org).
