		Identification of Transcriptional Dynamics using Pulse Models via
		4su-Seq Data and RNA-Seq Data // A tool for analyzing the
		transcription, processing and degradation rates of genes by
		4sU-seq (the Metabolic Label 4-thiouridine) data and RNA-seq
		(RNA sequencing) data. It can not only recognize the
		transcriptional dynamic rates at the measurement time points,
		but also obtain continuous changes in transcriptional dynamics.
		More importantly, it is able to predict the trend of mRNA
		(Mature RNA) transcription and expression changes in the
		future.
