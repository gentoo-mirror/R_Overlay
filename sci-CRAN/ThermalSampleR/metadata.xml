		Calculate Sample Sizes Required for Critical Thermal Limits
		Experiments // We present a range of simulations to aid
		researchers in determining appropriate sample sizes when
		performing critical thermal limits studies (e.g. CTmin/CTmin
		experiments). A number of wrapper functions are provided for
		plotting and summarising outputs from these simulations. These
		simulations are presented in van Steenderen, C.J.M., Sutton,
		G.F., Owen, C.A., Martin, G.D., and Coetzee, J.A. Sample size
		assessments for thermal physiology studies: An R package and R
		Shiny GUI. 2023. Physiological Entomology. Under review. The
		GUI version of this package is available on the R Shiny online
		server at:
		https://clarkevansteenderen.shinyapps.io/ThermalSampleR_Shiny/
		, or it is accessible via GitHub at
		https://github.com/clarkevansteenderen/ThermalSampleR_Shiny/.
		We would like to thank Grant Duffy (University of Otago,
		Dundedin, New Zealand) for granting us permission to use the
		source code for the Test of Total Equivalency function.
