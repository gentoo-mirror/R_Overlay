		Calculate Sample Sizes Required for Critical Thermal Limits
		Experiments // We present a range of simulations to aid
		researchers in determining appropriate sample sizes when
		performing critical thermal limits studies (e.g. CTmin/CTmin
		experiments). A number of wrapper functions are provided for
		plotting and summarising outputs from these simulations. These
		simulations are presented in Owen, C., Sutton, G., Martin, G.,
		van Steenderen, C., and Coetzee, J. Sample size determination
		for critical thermal limits studies. 2022. Physiological
		Entomology. Under review. The GUI version of this package is
		available on the R Shiny online server at:
		https://clarkevansteenderen.shinyapps.io/ThermalSampleR_Shiny/
		, or it is accessible via GitHub at
		https://github.com/clarkevansteenderen/ThermalSampleR_Shiny/.
		We would like to thank Grant Duffy (University of Otago,
		Dundedin, New Zealand) for granting us permission to use the
		source code for the Test of Total Equivalency function.
