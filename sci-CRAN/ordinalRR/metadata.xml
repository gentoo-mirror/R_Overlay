		Analysis of Repeatability and Reproducibility Studies with
		Ordinal Measurements // Implements Bayesian data analyses of
		balanced repeatability and reproducibility studies with ordinal
		measurements. Model fitting is based on MCMC posterior sampling
		with 'rjags'. Function ordinalRR() directly carries out the
		model fitting, and this function has the flexibility to allow
		the user to specify key aspects of the model, e.g., fixed
		versus random effects. Functions for preprocessing data and for
		the numerical and graphical display of a fitted model are also
		provided. There are also functions for displaying the model at
		fixed (user-specified) parameters and for simulating a
		hypothetical data set at a fixed (user-specified) set of
		parameters for a random-effects rater population. For
		additional technical details, refer to Culp, Ryan, Chen, and
		Hamada (2018) and cite this Technometrics paper when
		referencing any aspect of this work. The demo of this package
		reproduces results from the Technometrics paper.
