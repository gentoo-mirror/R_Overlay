		Age Band Decomposition Method for Tree Ring Standardization //
		Implements the Age Band Decomposition (ABD) method for
		standardizing tree ring width data while preserving both low
		and high frequency variability. Unlike traditional detrending
		approaches that can distort long term growth trends, ABD
		decomposes ring width series into multiple age classes,
		detrends each class separately, and then recombines them to
		create standardized chronologies. This approach improves the
		detection of growth signals linked to past climatic and
		environmental factors, making it particularly valuable for
		dendroecological and dendroclimatological studies. The package
		provides functions to perform ABD-based standardization,
		compare results with other common methods (e.g., BAI, C method,
		RCS), and facilitate the interpretation of growth patterns
		under current and future climate variability.
