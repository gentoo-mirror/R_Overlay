		Topological Data Analysis: Simplicial Complex // Provides an
		implementation of simplicial complexes for Topological Data
		Analysis (TDA). The package includes functions to compute
		faces, boundary operators, Betti numbers, Euler characteristic,
		and to construct simplicial complexes. It also implements
		persistent homology, from building filtrations to computing
		persistence diagrams, with the aim of helping readers
		understand the core concepts of computational topology. Methods
		are based on standard references in persistent homology such as
		Zomorodian and Carlsson (2005) doi:10.1007/s00454-004-1146-y
		and Chazal and Michel (2021) doi:10.3389/frai.2021.667963.
