		Explainable Outlier Detection Through Decision Tree Conditioning
		// Outlier detection method that flags suspicious values within
		observations, constrasting them against the normal values in a
		user-readable format, potentially describing conditions within
		the data that make a given outlier more rare. Full procedure is
		described in Cortes (2020) arXiv:2001.00636. Loosely based on
		the 'GritBot' https://www.rulequest.com/gritbot-info.html
		software.
