		Explainable Outlier Detection Through Decision Tree Conditioning
		// Will try to fit decision trees that try to "predict" values
		for each column based on the values of each other column. Along
		the way, each time a split is evaluated, it will take the
		observations that fall into each branch as a homogeneous
		cluster in which it will search for outliers in the 1-d
		distribution of the column being predicted. Outliers are
		determined according to confidence intervals in this 1-d
		distribution, and need to have a large gap with respect to the
		next observation in sorted order to be flagged as outliers.
		Since outliers are searched for in a decision tree branch, it
		will know the conditions that make it a rare observation
		compared to others that meet the same conditions, and the
		conditions will always be correlated with the target variable
		(as it's being predicted from them). Full procedure is
		described in Cortes (2020) arXiv:2001.00636. Loosely based on
		the 'GritBot' https://www.rulequest.com/gritbot-info.html
		software.
