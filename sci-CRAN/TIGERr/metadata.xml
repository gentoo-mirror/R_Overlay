		Technical Variation Elimination with Ensemble Learning
		Architecture // The R implementation of TIGER. TIGER integrates
		random forest algorithm into an innovative ensemble learning
		architecture. Benefiting from this advanced architecture, TIGER
		is resilient to outliers, free from model tuning and less
		likely to be affected by specific hyperparameters. TIGER
		supports targeted and untargeted metabolomics data and is
		competent to perform both intra- and inter-batch technical
		variation removal. TIGER can also be used for cross-kit
		adjustment to ensure data obtained from different analytical
		assays can be effectively combined and compared. Reference: Han
