		Historical, Relational, and Tail Anomaly-Detection Algorithms //
		The presence of outliers in a dataset can substantially bias
		the results of statistical analyses. To correct for outliers,
		micro edits are manually performed on all records. A set of
		constraints and decision rules is typically used to aid the
		editing process. However, straightforward decision rules might
		overlook anomalies arising from disruption of linear
		relationships. Computationally efficient methods are provided
		to identify historical, tail, and relational anomalies at the
		data-entry level (Sartore et al., 2024;
		doi:10.6339/24-JDS1136). A score statistic is developed for
		each anomaly type, using a distribution-free approach motivated
		by the Bienaym-Chebyshev's inequality, and fuzzy logic is used
		to detect cellwise outliers resulting from different types of
		anomalies. Each data entry is individually scored and
		individual scores are combined into a final score to determine
		anomalous entries. In contrast to fuzzy logic, Bayesian
		bootstrap and a Bayesian test based on empirical likelihoods
		are also provided as studied by Sartore et al. (2024;
		doi:10.3390/stats7040073). These algorithms allow for a more
		nuanced approach to outlier detection, as it can identify
		outliers at data-entry level which are not obviously distinct
		from the rest of the data. --- This research was supported in
		part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National
		Agriculture Statistics Service. The findings and conclusions in
		this publication are those of the authors and should not be
