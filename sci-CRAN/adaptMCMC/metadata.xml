		Implementation of a Generic Adaptive Monte Carlo Markov Chain
		Sampler // Enables sampling from arbitrary distributions if the
		log density is known up to a constant; a common situation in
		the context of Bayesian inference. The implemented sampling
		algorithm was proposed by Vihola (2012)
		DOI:10.1007/s11222-011-9269-5 and achieves often a high
		efficiency by tuning the proposal distributions to a user
		defined acceptance rate.
