		Read Census Privacy Protected Microdata Files // Implements data
		processing described in doi:10.1126/sciadv.abk3283 to align
		modern differentially private data with formatting of older US
		Census data releases. The primary goal is to read in Census
		Privacy Protected Microdata Files data in a reproducible way.
		This includes tools for aggregating to relevant levels of
		geography by creating geographic identifiers which match the US
		Census Bureau's numbering. Additionally, there are tools for
		grouping race numeric identifiers into categories, consistent
		with OMB (Office of Management and Budget) classifications.
		Functions exist for downloading and linking to existing sources
		of privacy protected microdata.
