		Power Analysis for AB Testing // Power analysis for AB testing.
		The calculations are based on the Welch's unequal variances
		t-test, which is generally preferred over the Student's t-test
		when sample sizes and variances of the two groups are unequal,
		which is frequently the case in AB testing. In such situations,
		the Student's t-test will give biased results due to using the
		pooled standard deviation, unlike the Welch's t-test.
