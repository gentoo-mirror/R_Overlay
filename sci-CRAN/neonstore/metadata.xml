		NEON Data Store // The National Ecological Observatory Network
		(NEON) provides access to its numerous data products through
		its REST API, https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/. This
		package provides a high-level user interface for downloading
		and storing NEON data products. While each of NEON data
		products consist of hundreds or thousands of individual files.
		Unlike 'neonUtilities', this package will avoid repeated
		downloading, provides persistent storage, and improves
		performance.  This package does not provide expose interactions
		with the individual low-level NEON API endpoints.
