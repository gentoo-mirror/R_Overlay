		A Two-Stage Approach to Maximize Interpretability of Drug
		Response Models Based on Multiple Molecular Data Types // A
		two-stage regression method that can be used when various input
		data types are correlated, for example gene expression and
		methylation in drug response prediction. In the first stage it
		uses the upstream features (such as methylation) to predict the
		response variable (such as drug response), and in the second
		stage it uses the downstream features (such as gene expression)
		to predict the residuals of the first stage. In our manuscript
		(Aben et al., 2016, doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw449), we show
		that using TANDEM prevents the model from being dominated by
		gene expression and that the features selected by TANDEM are
		more interpretable.
