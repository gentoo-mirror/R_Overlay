		Fast Statistical Hypothesis Tests on Rows and Columns of Matrices
		// Functions to perform fast statistical hypothesis tests on
		rows/columns of matrices. The main goals are: 1) speed via
		vectorization, 2) output that is detailed and easy to use, 3)
		compatibility with tests implemented in R (like those available
		in the 'stats' package).
