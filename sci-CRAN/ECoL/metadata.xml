		Complexity Measures for Supervised Problems // Provides measures
		to characterize the complexity of classification and regression
		problems based on aspects that quantify the linearity of the
		data, the presence of informative feature, the sparsity and
		dimensionality of the datasets. This package provides bug
		fixes, generalizations and implementations of many state of the
		art measures. The measures are described in the papers: Lorena
		et al. (2019) doi:10.1145/3347711 and Lorena et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1007/s10994-017-5681-1.
