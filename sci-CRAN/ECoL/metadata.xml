		Complexity Measures for Classification Problems // Provides
		measures to characterize the complexity of classification
		problems based on the ambiguity and the separation between the
		classes and the data sparsity and dimensionality of the
		datasets. This package provides bug fixes, generalizations and
		implementations of many state of the art measures. The measures
		are described in the paper: Tin Ho and Mitra Basu (2002)
		doi:10.1109/34.990132.
