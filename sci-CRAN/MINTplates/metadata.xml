		Encode "License-Plates" from Sequences and Decode Them Back // It
		can be used to create/encode molecular "license-plates" from
		sequences and to also decode the "license-plates" back to
		sequences.  While initially created for transfer RNA-derived
		small fragments, this tool can be used for any genomic
		sequences including but not limited to: transfer RNA-derived
		small fragments, microRNAs, etc. The detailed information can
		reference to the Pliatsika V, Loher P, Telonis AG, Rigoutsos I
