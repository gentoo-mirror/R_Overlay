		Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm for Impatient People
		// A fast, scalable, and versatile framework for simulating
		large systems with Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm
		('SSA').  This package is the spiritual successor to the
		'GillespieSSA' package originally written by Mario Pineda-Krch.
		Benefits of this package include major speed improvements
		(100x), easier to understand documentation, and many unit tests
		that try to ensure the package works as intended. Cannoodt and
		Saelens et al. (2021) doi:10.1038/s41467-021-24152-2.
