		Computing Key Indicators of the Spatial Distribution of Economic
		Activities // Computes a series of indices commonly used in the
		fields of economic geography, economic complexity, and
		evolutionary economics to describe the location, distribution,
		spatial organization, structure, and complexity of economic
		activities. Functions include basic spatial indicators such as
		the location quotient, the Krugman specialization index, the
		Herfindahl or the Shannon entropy indices but also more
		advanced functions to compute different forms of normalized
		relatedness between economic activities or network-based
		measures of economic complexity. Most of the functions use
		matrix calculus and are based on bipartite (incidence) matrices
		consisting of region - industry pairs. These are described in
		Balland (2017) http://econ.geo.uu.nl/peeg/peeg1709.pdf.
