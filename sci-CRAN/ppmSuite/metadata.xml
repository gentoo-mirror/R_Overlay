		A Collection of Models that Employ a Product Partition
		Distribution as a Prior on Partitions // Provides a suite of
		functions that fit models that use PPM type priors for
		partitions. Models include hierarchical Gaussian and probit
		ordinal models with  a (covariate dependent) PPM.  If a
		covariate dependent product partition model is selected, then
		all the options detailed in Page, G.L.; Quintana, F.A. (2018)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9777-z are available.  If covariate
		values are missing, then the approach detailed in Page, G.L.;
		Quintana, F.A.; Mueller, P (2020)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2021.1999824 is employed.  Also included
		in the package is a function that fits a Gaussian likelihood
		spatial product  partition model that is detailed in Page,
		G.L.; Quintana, F.A. (2016)  doi:10.1214/15-BA971, and
		multivariate PPM change point models that are detailed in
		Quinlan, J.J.; Page, G.L.; Castro, L.M. (2021)
		arXiv:2201.07830.
