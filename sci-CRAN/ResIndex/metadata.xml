		Generate Simple yet Effective Metric of Feature Importance for
		Classification Problems // An intuitive and explainable metric
		of Feature Importance for Classification Problems. Resolution
		Index measures the extent to which a Feature clusters different
		classes when data is sorted on it. User provides a DataFrame,
		column name of the Class, sample size and number of iterations
		used for calculation. Resolution Index for each Feature is
		returned, which can be effectively used to rank Features and
		reduce Dimensionality of Training data. For more details on
		Feature Selection see Theng and Bhoyar (2023)
