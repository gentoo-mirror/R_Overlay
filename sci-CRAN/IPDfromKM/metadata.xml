		Map Digitized Survival Curves Back to Individual Patient Data //
		An implementation to reconstruct individual patient data from
		Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves, visualize and assess the
		accuracy of the reconstruction, then perform secondary analysis
		on the reconstructed data. We involve a simple function to
		extract the coordinates form the published K-M curves. The
		function is developed based on Poisot T. s digitize package
		(2011)  doi:10.32614/RJ-2011-004 . For more complex and tangled
		together graphs, digitizing software, such as 'DigitizeIt' (for
		MAC or windows) or 'ScanIt'(for windows) can be used to get the
		coordinates. Additional information should also be involved to
		increase the accuracy, like numbers of patients at risk (often
		reported at 5-10 time points under the x-axis of the K-M
		graph), total number of patients, and total number of events.
		The package implements the modified iterative K-M estimation
		algorithm (modified-iKM) improved upon the approach proposed by
		Guyot (2012) doi:10.1186/1471-2288-12-9 with some
		modifications.
