		Sample Size Computations Controlling the Type-II Generalized
		Family-Wise Error Rate // The significance of mean difference
		tests in clinical trials is established if at least r null
		hypotheses are rejected among m that are simultaneously tested.
		This package enables one to compute necessary sample sizes for
		single-step (Bonferroni) and step-wise procedures (Holm and
		Hochberg). These three procedures control the q-generalized
		family-wise error rate (probability of making at least q false
		rejections). Sample size is computed (for these single-step and
		step-wise procedures) in a such a way that the r-power
		(probability of rejecting at least r false null hypotheses,
		i.e. at least r significant endpoints among m) is above some
		given threshold, in the context of tests of difference of means
		for two groups of continuous endpoints (variables). Various
		types of structure of correlation are considered. It is also
		possible to analyse data (i.e., actually test difference in
		means) when these are available. The case r equals 1 is treated
		in separate functions that were used in Lafaye de Micheaux et
		al. (2014) doi:10.1080/10543406.2013.860156.
