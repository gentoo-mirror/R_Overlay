		Analyze, Summarize, and Visualize Daily Streamflow Data // The
		Flow Analysis Summary Statistics Tool for R, 'fasstr', provides
		various functions to tidy and screen daily stream discharge
		data; calculate and visualize various summary statistics and
		metrics; and compute annual trending (using 'zyp' package
		methods https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zyp) and volume
		frequency analyses (using methods similar to HEC-SSP (2019)
		https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ssp/). It features
		useful function arguments for filtering of and handling dates,
		customizing data and metrics, and the ability to pull daily
		data directly from the Water Survey of Canada hydrometric
		database
		(https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/hydrometrics/www/).
