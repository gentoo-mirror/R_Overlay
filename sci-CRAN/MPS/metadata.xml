		Estimating Through the Maximum Product Spacing Approach //
		Developed for computing the probability density function,
		computing the cumulative distribution function, computing the
		quantile function, random generation, and estimating the
		parameters of 24 G-family of statistical distributions via the
		maximum product spacing approach introduced in
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345411. The set of families
		contains: beta G distribution, beta exponential G distribution,
		beta extended G distribution, exponentiated G distribution,
		exponentiated exponential Poisson G distribution, exponentiated
		generalized G distribution, exponentiated Kumaraswamy G
		distribution, gamma type I G distribution, gamma type II G
		distribution, gamma uniform G distribution, gamma-X generated
		of log-logistic family of G distribution, gamma-X family of
		modified beta exponential G distribution, geometric exponential
		Poisson G distribution, generalized beta G distribution,
		generalized transmuted G distribution, Kumaraswamy G
		distribution, log gamma type I G distribution, log gamma type
		II G distribution, Marshall Olkin G distribution, Marshall
		Olkin Kumaraswamy G distribution, modified beta G distribution,
		odd log-logistic G distribution, truncated-exponential skew-
		symmetric G distribution, and Weibull G distribution.
