		Use and if Needed Install Packages from CRAN, BioConductor, CRAN
		Archive, and GitHub // This tries to attach a package if you
		have it; if not, it tries to install it from BioConductor or
		CRAN; if not available there, it tries to install it from the
		cran mirror on GitHub, which includes packages that have been
		removed from CRAN; if not available there, it looks for a
		matching other package on GitHub to install. Note this is
		sloppy practice and prone to all sorts of risks. However, there
		are use cases, such as quick scripting, or in a class where
		students already know best practices, where this can be useful.
		yearn was inspired by teaching in PhyloMeth, a course funded by
		an NSF CAREER award to the author (NSF DEB-1453424).
