		Classification -- Bayesian Adaptive Smoothing Splines // Fit
		multiclass Classification version of Bayesian Adaptive
		Smoothing Splines (CBASS) to data using reversible jump MCMC.
		The multiclass classification problem consists of a response
		variable that takes on unordered categorical values with at
		least three levels, and a set of inputs for each response
		variable. The CBASS model consists of a latent multivariate
		probit formulation, and the means of the latent Gaussian random
		variables are specified using adaptive regression splines. The
		MCMC alternates updates of the latent Gaussian variables and
		the spline parameters. All the spline parameters (variables,
		signs, knots, number of interactions), including the number of
		basis functions used to model each latent mean, are inferred.
		Functions are provided to process inputs, initialize the chain,
		run the chain, and make predictions. Predictions are made on a
		probabilistic basis, where, for a given input, the
		probabilities of each categorical value are produced. See Marrs
		and Francom (2023) "Multiclass classification using Bayesian
		multivariate adaptive regression splines" Under review.
