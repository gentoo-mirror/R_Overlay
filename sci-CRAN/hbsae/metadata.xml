		Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation // Functions to
		compute small area estimates based on a basic area or unit-
		level model. The model is fit using restricted maximum
		likelihood, or in a hierarchical Bayesian way. In the latter
		case numerical integration is used to average over the
		posterior density for the between-area variance. The output
		includes the model fit, small area estimates and corresponding
		mean squared errors, as well as some model selection measures.
		Additional functions provide means to compute aggregate
		estimates and mean squared errors, to minimally adjust the
		small area estimates to benchmarks at a higher aggregation
		level, and to graphically compare different sets of small area
		estimates.
