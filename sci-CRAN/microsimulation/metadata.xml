		Discrete Event Simulation in R and C++, with Tools for Cost-
		Effectiveness Analysis // Discrete event simulation using both
		R and C++ (Karlsson et al 2016;
		doi:10.1109/eScience.2016.7870915). The C++ code is adapted
		from the SSIM library https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/ssim/,
		allowing for both event-oriented and process-oriented
		simulation. The code includes a SummaryReport class for
		reporting events and costs by age and other covariates. The C++
		code is available as a static library for linking to other
		packages. A priority queue implementation is given in C++
		together with an S3 closure and a reference class
		implementation. Finally, some tools are provided for cost-
		effectiveness analysis.
