		Ricci Calculus // Provides a compact 'R' interface for performing
		tensor calculations. This is achieved by allowing (upper and
		lower) index labeling of arrays and making use of Ricci
		calculus conventions to implicitly trigger contractions and
		diagonal subsetting. Explicit tensor operations, such as
		addition, subtraction and multiplication of tensors via the
		standard operators, raising and lowering indices, taking
		symmetric or antisymmetric tensor parts, as well as the
		Kronecker product are available. Common tensors like the
		Kronecker delta, Levi Civita epsilon, certain metric tensors,
		the Christoffel symbols, the Riemann as well as Ricci tensors
		are provided. The covariant derivative of tensor fields with
		respect to any metric tensor can be evaluated. An effort was
		made to provide the user with useful error messages.
