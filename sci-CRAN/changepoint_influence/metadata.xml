		Package to Calculate the Influence of the Data on a Changepoint
		Segmentation // Allows users to input their data, segmentation
		and function used for the segmentation (and additional
		arguments) and the package calculates the influence of the data
		on the changepoint locations, see Wilms et al. (2021)
		arXiv:2107.10572.  Currently this can only be used with the
		changepoint package functions to identify changes, but we plan
		to extend this.  There are options for different types of
		graphics to assess the influence.
