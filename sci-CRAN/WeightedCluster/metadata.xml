		Clustering of Weighted Data // Clusters state sequences and
		weighted data. It provides an optimized weighted PAM algorithm
		as well as functions for aggregating replicated cases,
		computing cluster quality measures for a range of clustering
		solutions and plotting (fuzzy) clusters of state sequences.
		Parametric bootstraps methods to validate typology of sequences
		are also provided. Finally, it provides a fuzzy and crisp CLARA
		algorithm to cluster large database with sequence analysis.
