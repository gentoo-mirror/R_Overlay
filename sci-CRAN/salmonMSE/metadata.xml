		Management Strategy Evaluation for Salmon Species // Simulation
		tools to evaluate the long-term effects of salmon management
		strategies, including a combination of habitat, harvest, and
		habitat actions. The stochastic age-structured operating model
		accommodates complex life histories, including freshwater
		survival across early life stages, juvenile survival and
		fishery exploitation in the marine life stage, partial maturity
		by age class, and fitness impacts of hatchery programs on
		natural spawning populations. 'salmonMSE' also provides an age-
		structured conditioning model to develop operating models
		fitted to data.
