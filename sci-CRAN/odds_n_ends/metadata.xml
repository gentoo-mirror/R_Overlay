		Odds Ratios, Contingency Table, and Model Significance from a
		Generalized Linear Model Object // Computes odds ratios and 95%
		confidence intervals from a generalized linear model object. It
		also computes model significance with the chi-squared statistic
		and p-value and it computes model fit using a contingency table
		to determine the percent of observations for which the model
		correctly predicts the value of the outcome. Calculates model
		sensitivity and specificity.
