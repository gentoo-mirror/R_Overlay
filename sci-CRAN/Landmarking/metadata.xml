		Analysis using Landmark Models // The landmark approach allows
		survival predictions to be updated dynamically as new
		measurements from an individual are recorded. The idea is to
		set predefined time points, known as "landmark times", and form
		a model at each landmark time using only the individuals in the
		risk set. This package allows the longitudinal data to be
		modelled either using the last observation carried forward or
		linear mixed effects modelling. There is also the option to
		model competing risks, either through cause-specific Cox
		regression or Fine-Gray regression. To find out more about the
		methods in this package, please see https://isobelbarrott.githu
