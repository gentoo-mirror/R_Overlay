		Faster Raster and Spatial Vector Processing Using 'GRASS' //
		Processing of large-in-memory/large-on disk rasters and spatial
		vectors using 'GRASS' https://grass.osgeo.org/. Most functions
		in the 'terra' package are  recreated. Processing of medium-
		sized and smaller spatial objects will nearly always be faster
		using 'terra' or 'sf', but for large-in-memory/large-on-disk
		objects, 'fasterRaster' may be faster. To use most of the
		functions, you must have the stand-alone version (not the
		'OSGeoW4' installer version) of 'GRASS' 8.0 or higher.
