		Plot Flow Charts According to the "PRISMA" Statement // Plot a
		PRISMA http://prisma-statement.org/ flow chart describing the
		identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion or studies
		in systematic reviews. The PRISMA statement defines an
		evidence-based, minimal set of items for reporting in
		systematic reviews and meta-analyses. PRISMA should be used for
		the reporting of studies evaluating randomized clinical trials
		(RCT), and is also for reporting on systematic reviews of other
		types of research. There is also a function to generate flow
		charts describing exclusions and inclusions for any kind of
		study.
