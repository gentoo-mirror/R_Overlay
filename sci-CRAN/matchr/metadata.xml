		Pattern Matching and Enumerated Types in R // Inspired by pattern
		matching and enum types in Rust and many functional programming
		languages, this package offers an updated version of the
		'switch' function called 'Match' that accepts atomic values,
		functions, expressions, and enum variants. Conditions and
		return expressions are separated by '-' and multiple conditions
		can be associated with the same return expression using '|'.
		'Match' also includes support for 'fallthrough'. The package
		also replicates the Result and Option enums from Rust.
