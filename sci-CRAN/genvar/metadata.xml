		An Imperative Library for Data Manipulation // Implements tools
		for manipulating data sets and performing regressions in a way
		that is familiar to users of a popular, but proprietary,
		statistical package commonly used in the social sciences. Loads
		a single dataset into memory and implements a set of imperative
		commands to modify that data and perform regressions and other
		analysis on the dataset. Offers an alternative to standard R's
		function-based approach to data manipulation.
