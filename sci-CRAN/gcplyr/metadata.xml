		Wrangle and Analyze Growth Curve Data // Easy wrangling and
		model-free analysis of microbial growth curve data, as commonly
		output by plate readers. Tools for reshaping common plate
		reader outputs into 'tidy' formats and merging them with design
		information, making data easy to work with using 'gcplyr' and
		other packages. Also streamlines common growth curve processing
		steps, like smoothing and calculating derivatives, and
		facilitates model-free characterization and analysis of growth
		data. See methods at https://mikeblazanin.github.io/gcplyr/.
