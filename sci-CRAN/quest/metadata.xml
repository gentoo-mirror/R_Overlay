		Prepare Questionnaire Data for Analysis // Offers a suite of
		functions to prepare questionnaire data for analysis (perhaps
		other types of data as well). By data preparation, I mean data
		analytic tasks to get your raw data ready for statistical
		modeling (e.g., regression). There are functions to investigate
		missing data, reshape data, validate responses, recode
		variables, score questionnaires, center variables, aggregate by
		groups, shift scores (i.e., leads or lags), etc. It provides
		functions for both single level and multilevel (i.e., grouped)
		data. With a few exceptions (e.g., ncases()), functions without
		an "s" at the end of their primary word (e.g., center_by()) act
		on atomic vectors, while functions with an "s" at the end of
		their primary word (e.g., centers_by()) act on multiple columns
		of a data.frame.
