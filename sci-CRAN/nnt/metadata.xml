		Estimate the NNT using the proposed method in Yang and Yin's
		paper (2019) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0223301, in which the
		NNT-RMST (number needed to treat based on the restricted mean
		survival time) is defined as the RMST (restricted mean survival
		time) in the control group divided by the difference in RMSTs
		between the treatment and control groups up to a chosen time t.
