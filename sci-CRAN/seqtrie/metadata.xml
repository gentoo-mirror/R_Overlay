		Radix Tree and Trie-Based String Distances // A collection of
		Radix Tree and Trie algorithms for finding similar sequences
		and calculating sequence distances (Levenshtein and other
		distance metrics). This work was inspired by a trie
		implementation in Python: "Fast and Easy Levenshtein distance
		using a Trie." Hanov (2011)
