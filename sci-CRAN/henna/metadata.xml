		A Versatile Visualization Suite // A visualization suite
		primarily designed for single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis
		applications, but adaptable to other purposes as well. It
		introduces novel plots to represent two-variable and frequency
		data and optimizes some commonly used plotting options (e.g.,
		correlation, network, density and alluvial plots) for ease of
		usage and flexibility.
