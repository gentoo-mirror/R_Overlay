		Joint Model of Heterogeneous Repeated Measures and Survival Data
		// Maximum likelihood estimation for the semi-parametric joint
		modeling of competing risks and longitudinal data in the
		presence of heterogeneous within-subject variability, proposed
		by Li and colleagues (2023) arXiv:2301.06584. The proposed
		method models the within-subject variability of the biomarker
		and associates it with the risk of the competing risks event.
		The time-to-event data is modeled using a (cause-specific) Cox
		proportional hazards regression model with time-fixed
		covariates. The longitudinal outcome is modeled using a mixed-
		effects location and scale model. The association is captured
		by shared random effects. The model is estimated using an
		Expectation Maximization algorithm.
