		Necessary Condition Analysis // Performs a Necessary Condition
		Analysis (NCA). (Dul, J. 2016. Necessary Condition Analysis
		(NCA). ''Logic and Methodology of 'Necessary but not
		Sufficient' causality." Organizational Research Methods 19(1),
		10-52, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1094428115
		584005). NCA identifies necessary (but not sufficient)
		conditions in datasets, where x causes (e.g. precedes) y.
		Instead of drawing a regression line ''through the middle of
		the data'' in an xy-plot, NCA draws the ceiling line. The
		ceiling line y = f(x) separates the area with observations from
		the area without observations. (Nearly) all observations are
		below the ceiling line: y = f(x). The empty zone is in the
		upper left hand corner of the xy-plot (with the convention that
		the x-axis is ''horizontal'' and the y-axis is ''vertical'' and
		that values increase ''upwards'' and ''to the right''). The
		ceiling line is a (piecewise) linear non-decreasing line: a
		linear step function or a straight line. It indicates which
		level of x (e.g. an effort or input) is necessary but not
		sufficient for a (desired) level of y (e.g. good performance or
		output). A quick start guide for using this package can be
		found here: https://repub.eur.nl/pub/78323/ or
