		Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis Utility Toolkit //
		Provides a function toolkit to facilitate reproducible RNA-Seq
		Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis (Law (2015)
		doi:10.12688/f1000research.9005.3).  The tools include both
		analysis work-flow and utility functions: mapping/unit
		conversion, count normalization, accounting for unknown
		covariates, and more.  This is a complement/cohort to the
		'DGEobj' package that provides a flexible container to manage
		and annotate Differential Gene Expression analysis results.
