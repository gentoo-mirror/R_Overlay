		Pedigree Models // Provides functions to estimate mixed probit
		models using, for instance, pedigree data like in
		doi:10.1002/sim.1603. The models are also commonly called
		liability threshold models. The approximation is based on
		direct log marginal likelihood approximations like the
		randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo suggested by
		doi:10.1198/106186002394 with a similar procedure to
		approximate the derivatives. Graph-based methods are also
		provided that can be used to simplify pedigrees.
