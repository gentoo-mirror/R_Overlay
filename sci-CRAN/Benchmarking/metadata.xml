		Benchmark and Frontier Analysis Using DEA and SFA // Methods for
		frontier analysis, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), under
		different technology assumptions (fdh, vrs, drs, crs, irs,
		add/frh, and fdh+), and using different efficiency measures
		(input based, output based, hyperbolic graph, additive, super,
		and directional efficiency). Peers and slacks are available,
		partial price information can be included, and optimal cost,
		revenue and profit can be calculated. Evaluation of mergers is
		also supported.  Methods for graphing the technology sets are
		also included. There is also support for comparative methods
		based on Stochastic Frontier Analyses (SFA) and for convex
		nonparametric least squares of convex functions (STONED). In
		general, the methods can be used to solve not only standard
		models, but also many other model variants. It complements the
		book, Bogetoft and Otto, Benchmarking with DEA, SFA, and R,
		Springer-Verlag, 2011, but can of course also be used as a
		stand-alone package.
