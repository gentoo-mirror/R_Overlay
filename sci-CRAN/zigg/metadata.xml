		Lightweight Interfaces to the 'Ziggurat' Pseudo Random Number
		Generator // The 'Ziggurat' pseudo-random number generator (or
		PRNG), introduced by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08) and further improved by Leong et al
		(2005, doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07), offers a lightweight and
		very fast PRNG for the normal, exponential, and uniform
		distributions. It is provided here in a small zero-dependency
		package. It can be used from R as well as from 'C/C++' code in
		other packages as is demonstrated by four included sample
		packages using four distinct methods to use the PRNG presented
		here in client package. The implementation is influenced by our
		package 'RcppZiggurat' which offers a comparison among multiple
		alternative implementations but presented here in a lighter-
		weight implementation that is easier to use by other packages.
		The PRNGs provided are generally faster than the ones in base
		R: on our machine, the relative gains for normal, exponential
		and uniform are on the order of 7.4, 5.2 and 4.7 times faster
		than base R. However, these generators are of potentially
		lesser quality and shorter period so if in doubt use of the
		base R functions remains the general recommendation.
