		Robust Bayesian T-Test // An implementation of Bayesian model-
		averaged t-test that allows users to draw inference about the
		presence vs absence of the effect, heterogeneity of variances,
		and outliers. The 'RoBTT' packages estimates model ensembles of
		models created as a combination of the competing hypotheses and
		uses Bayesian model-averaging to combine the models using
		posterior model probabilities. Users can obtain the model-
		averaged posterior distributions and inclusion Bayes factors
		which account for the uncertainty in the data generating
		process (Maier et al., 2022, doi:10.31234/osf.io/d5zwc). Users
		can define a wide range of informative priors for all
		parameters of interest. The package provides convenient
		functions for summary, visualizations, and fit diagnostics.
