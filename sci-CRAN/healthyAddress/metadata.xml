		Convert Addresses to Standard Inputs // Efficient tools for
		parsing and standardizing Australian addresses from textual
		data. It utilizes optimized algorithms to accurately identify
		and extract components of addresses, such as street names,
		types, and postcodes, especially for large batched data in
		contexts where sending addresses to internet services may be
		slow or inappropriate. The core functionality is built on fast
		string processing techniques to handle variations in address
		formats and abbreviations commonly found in Australian address
		data. Designed for data scientists, urban planners, and
		logistics analysts, the package facilitates the cleaning and
		normalization of address information, supporting better data
		integration and analysis in urban studies, geography, and
		related fields.
