		Motif Analysis in Multi-Level Networks // Tools for motif
		analysis in multi-level networks. Multi-level networks combine
		multiple networks in one, e.g. social-ecological networks.
		Motifs are small configurations of nodes and edges (subgraphs)
		occurring in networks. 'motifr' can visualize multi-level
		networks, count multi-level network motifs and compare motif
		occurrences to baseline models. It also identifies
		contributions of existing or potential edges to motifs to find
		critical or missing edges. The package is in many parts an R
		wrapper for the excellent 'SESMotifAnalyser' 'Python' package
		written by Tim Seppelt.
