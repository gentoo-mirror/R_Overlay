		Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for High-Dimensional Mixed
		Data // Semi-parametric approach for sparse canonical
		correlation analysis which can handle mixed data types:
		continuous, binary and truncated continuous. Bridge functions
		are provided to connect Kendall's tau to latent correlation
		under the Gaussian copula model. The methods are described in
		Yoon, Carroll and Gaynanova (2020) doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa007
		and Yoon, Mller and Gaynanova (2020) arXiv:2006.13875.
