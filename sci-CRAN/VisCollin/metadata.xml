		Visualizing Collinearity Diagnostics // Provides methods to
		calculate diagnostics for multicollinearity among predictors in
		a linear or generalized linear model. It also provides methods
		to visualize those diagnostics following Friendly  Kwan (2009),
		"Wheres Waldo: Visualizing Collinearity Diagnostics",
		doi:10.1198/tast.2009.0012. These include better tabular
		presentation of collinearity diagnostics that highlight the
		important numbers, a semi-graphic tableplot of the diagnostics
		to make warning and danger levels more salient, and a
		"collinearity biplot" of the smallest dimensions of predictor
		space, where collinearity is most apparent.
