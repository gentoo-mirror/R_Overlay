		Nonlinear Regression Modelling using Robust Methods // Non-Linear
		Robust package is developed to handle the problem of outliers
		in nonlinear regression,    using robust statistics. It covers
		classic methods in nonlinear regression as well. It has
		facilities to fit models in the case of auto correlated and
		heterogeneous variance cases, while it include tools to
		detecting outliers in nonlinear regression. (Riazoshams H, Midi
