		Toolkit for Corpus Analysis // Library for corpus analysis using
		the Corpus Workbench as an efficient back end for indexing and
		querying large corpora. The package offers functionality to
		flexibly create partitions and to carry out basic statistical
		operations (count, co-occurrences etc.). The original full text
		of documents can be reconstructed and inspected at any time.
		Beyond that, the package is intended to serve as an interface
		to packages implementing advanced statistical procedures.
		Respective data structures (document term matrices, term co-
		occurrence matrices etc.) can be created based on the indexed
		corpora.
