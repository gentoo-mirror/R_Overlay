		Bayesian Analysis of Non-Stationary Gaussian Process Models //
		Enables off-the-shelf functionality for fully Bayesian,
		nonstationary Gaussian process modeling. The approach to
		nonstationary modeling involves a closed-form, convolution-
		based covariance function with spatially-varying parameters;
		these parameter processes can be specified either
		deterministically (using covariates or basis functions) or
		stochastically (using approximate Gaussian processes).
		Stationary Gaussian processes are a special case of our
		methodology, and we furthermore implement approximate Gaussian
		process inference to account for very large spatial data sets
		(Finley, et al (2017) arXiv:1702.00434v2). Bayesian inference
		is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods via the
		'nimble' package, and posterior prediction for the Gaussian
		process at unobserved locations is provided as a post-
		processing step.
