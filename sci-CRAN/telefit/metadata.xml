		Estimation and Prediction for Remote Effects Spatial Process
		Models // Implementation of the remote effects spatial process
		(RESP) model for teleconnection.  The RESP model is a
		geostatistical model that allows a spatially-referenced
		variable (like average precipitation) to be influenced by
		covariates defined on a remote domain (like sea surface
		temperatures).  The RESP model is introduced in Hewitt et al.
		(2018) arXiv:1612.06303.  Sample code for working with the RESP
		model is available at
		https://jmhewitt.github.io/research/resp_example.
