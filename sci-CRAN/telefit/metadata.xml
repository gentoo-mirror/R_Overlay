		Estimation and Prediction for Remote Effects Spatial Process
		Models // Implementation of the remote effects spatial process
		(RESP) model for teleconnection.  The RESP model is a
		geostatistical model that allows a spatially-referenced
		variable (like average precipitation) to be influenced by
		covariates defined on a remote domain (like sea surface
		temperatures).  The RESP model is introduced in Hewitt et al.
		(2018) doi:10.1002/env.2523.  Sample code for working with the
		RESP model is available at
		https://jmhewitt.github.io/research/resp_example. This material
		is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation
		under grant number AGS 1419558. Any opinions, findings, and
		conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are
		those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views
		of the National Science Foundation.
