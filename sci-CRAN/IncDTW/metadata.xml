		Incremental Calculation of Dynamic Time Warping // The Dynamic
		Time Warping (DTW) distance measure for time series allows non-
		linear alignments of time series to match  similar patterns in
		time series of different lengths and or different speeds.
		IncDTW is characterized by (1) the incremental calculation of
		DTW (reduces runtime complexity to a linear level for updating
		the DTW distance) - especially for life data streams or
		subsequence matching, (2) the vector based implementation of
		DTW which is faster because no matrices are allocated (reduces
		the space complexity from a quadratic to a linear level in the
		number of observations) - for all runtime intensive DTW
		computations, (3) the subsequence matching algorithm runDTW,
		that efficiently finds the k-NN to a query pattern in a long
		time series, and (4) C++ in the heart. For details about DTW
		see the original paper "Dynamic programming algorithm
		optimization for spoken word recognition" by Sakoe and Chiba
		(1978) DOI:10.1109/TASSP.1978.1163055. For details about this
		package, Dynamic Time Warping and Incremental Dynamic Time
		Warping please see "IncDTW: An R Package for Incremental
		Calculation of Dynamic Time Warping" by Leodolter et al. (2021)
