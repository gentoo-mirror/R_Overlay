		Incremental Calculation of Dynamic Time Warping // Implements
		incremental calculation of the DTW ( Dynamic Time Warping)
		distance of two vectors, which is specifically useful for life
		data streams. Further the calculation of the global cost matrix
		is implemented in C++ to be faster. The Sakoe Chiba band is
		also implemented. The calculation of DTW is less functional
		then the one of dtw(), however much faster. For details about
		DTW see the original paper "Dynamic programming algorithm
		optimization for spoken word recognition" by Sakoe and Chiba
		(1978) DOI:10.1109/TASSP.1978.1163055.
