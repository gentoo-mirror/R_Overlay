		Decipher Mutational Signatures from Somatic Mutational Catalogs
		// Cancer cells accumulate DNA mutations as result of DNA
		damage and DNA repair processes. This computational framework
		is aimed at deciphering DNA mutational signatures operating in
		cancer. The framework includes modules that support raw data
		import and processing, mutational signature extraction, and
		results interpretation and visualization. The framework accepts
		widely used file formats storing information about DNA
		variants, such as Variant Call Format files. The framework
		performs Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to extract
		mutational signatures explaining the observed set of DNA
		mutations. Bootstrapping is performed as part of the analysis.
		The framework supports parallelization and is optimized for use
		on multi-core systems. The software is based on a custom
		R-based implementation of the original MATLAB WTSI framework by
		Alexandrov LB et al (2013) doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2012.12.008.
