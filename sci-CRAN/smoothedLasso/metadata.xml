		A Framework to Smooth L1 Penalized Regression Operators using
		Nesterov Smoothing // We provide full functionality to smooth
		L1 penalized regression operators and to compute regression
		estimates thereof. For this, the objective function of a user-
		specified regression operator is first smoothed using Nesterov
		smoothing (see Y. Nesterov (2005)
		doi:10.1007/s10107-004-0552-5), resulting in a modified
		objective function with explicit gradients everywhere. The
		smoothed objective function and its gradient are minimized via
		BFGS, and the obtained minimizer is returned. Using Nesterov
		smoothing, the smoothed objective function can be made
		arbitrarily close to the original (unsmoothed) one. In
		particular, the Nesterov approach has the advantage that it
		comes with explicit accuracy bounds, both on the L1/L2
		difference of the unsmoothed to the smoothed objective
		functions as well as on their respective minimizers (see G.
		Hahn, S.M. Lutz, N. Laha, C. Lange (2020)
		doi:10.1101/2020.09.17.301788). A progressive smoothing
		approach is provided which iteratively smoothes the objective
		function, resulting in more stable regression estimates. A
		function to perform cross validation for selection of the
		regularization parameter is provided.
