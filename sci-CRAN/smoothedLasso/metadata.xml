		Smoothed LASSO Regression via Nesterov Smoothing // We provide
		full functionality to compute smoothed LASSO regression
		estimates. For this, the LASSO objective function is first
		smoothed using Nesterov smoothing (see Y. Nesterov (2005)
		doi:10.1007/s10107-004-0552-5), resulting in a modified LASSO
		objective function with explicit gradients everywhere. The
		smoothed objective function and its gradient are used to
		minimize it via BFGS, and the obtained minimizer is returned.
		Using Nesterov smoothing, the smoothed LASSO objective function
		can be made arbitrarily close to the original (unsmoothed) one.
		In particular, the Nesterov approach has the advantage that it
		comes with explicit accuracy bounds, both on the L1/L2
		difference of the unsmoothed to the smoothed LASSO objective
		function as well as on their respective minimizers. A
		progressive smoothing approach is provided which iteratively
		smoothes the LASSO, resulting in more stable regression
		estimates.
