		Parametric Bootstrap, Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite Based
		Methods for Test in Mixed Models // Test in mixed effects
		models. Attention is on mixed effects models as implemented in
		the 'lme4' package. For linear mixed models, this package
		implements (1) a parametric bootstrap test, (2) a Kenward-
		Roger-typ modification of F-tests for linear mixed effects
		models and (3) a Satterthwaite-type modification of F-tests for
		linear mixed effects models. The package also implements a
		parametric bootstrap test for generalized linear mixed models.
		The facilities of the package are documented in the paper by
		Halehoh and Hjsgaard, (2012, doi:10.18637/jss.v059.i09).
