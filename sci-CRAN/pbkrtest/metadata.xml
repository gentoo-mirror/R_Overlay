		Parametric Bootstrap, Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite Based
		Methods for Test in Mixed Models // Computes p-values based on
		(a) Satterthwaite or Kenward-Rogers degree of freedom methods
		and (b) parametric bootstrap for mixed effects models as
		implemented in the 'lme4' package. Implements parametric
		bootstrap test for generalized linear mixed models as
		implemented in 'lme4' and generalized linear models. The
		package is documented in the paper by Halekoh and Hjsgaard,
		(2012, doi:10.18637/jss.v059.i09).  Please see
		'citation("pbkrtest")' for citation details.
