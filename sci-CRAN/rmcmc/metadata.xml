		Robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods // Functions for
		simulating Markov chains using the Barker proposal to compute
		Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates of expectations with
		respect to a target distribution on a real-valued vector space.
		The Barker proposal, described in Livingstone and Zanella
		(2022) doi:10.1111/rssb.12482, is a gradient-based MCMC
		algorithm inspired by the Barker accept-reject rule. It
		combines the robustness of simpler MCMC schemes, such as
		random-walk Metropolis, with the efficiency of gradient-based
		methods, such as the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm.
		The key function provided by the package is sample_chain(),
		which allows sampling a Markov chain with a specified target
		distribution as its stationary distribution. The chain is
		sampled by generating proposals and accepting or rejecting them
		using a Metropolis-Hasting acceptance rule. During an initial
		warm-up stage, the parameters of the proposal distribution can
		be adapted, with adapters available to both: tune the scale of
		the proposals by coercing the average acceptance rate to a
		target value; tune the shape of the proposals to match
		covariance estimates under the target distribution. As well as
		the default Barker proposal, the package also provides
		implementations of alternative proposal distributions, such as
		(Gaussian) random walk and Langevin proposals. Optionally, if
		'BridgeStan's R interface
		https://roualdes.us/bridgestan/latest/languages/r.html,
		available on GitHub https://github.com/roualdes/bridgestan, is
		installed, then 'BridgeStan' can be used to specify the target
		distribution to sample from.
