		Visualize 'Confounder' Control in Meta-Analyses // Visualize
		'confounder' control in meta-analysis. 'metaconfoundr' is an
		approach to evaluating bias in studies used in meta-analyses
		based on the causal inference framework. Study groups create a
		causal diagram displaying their assumptions about the
		scientific question. From this, they develop a list of
		important 'confounders'. Then, they evaluate whether studies
		controlled for these variables well. 'metaconfoundr' is a
		toolkit to facilitate this process and visualize the results as
		heat maps, traffic light plots, and more.
