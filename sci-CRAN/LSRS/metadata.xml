		Land Surface Remote Sensing // Rapid satellite data streams in
		operational applications have clear benefits for monitoring
		land cover, especially when information can be delivered as
		fast as changing surface conditions. Over the past decade,
		remote sensing has become a key tool for monitoring and
		predicting environmental variables by using satellite data.
		This package presents the main applications in remote sensing
		for land surface monitoring and land cover mapping (soil,
		vegetation, water...). Tomlinson, C.J., Chapman, L., Thornes,
		E., Baker, C (2011) doi:10.1002/met.287.
