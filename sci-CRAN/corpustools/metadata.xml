		Managing, Querying and Analyzing Tokenized Text // Provides text
		analysis in R, focusing on the use of a tokenized text format.
		In this format, the positions of tokens are maintained, and
		each token can be annotated (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
		dependency relations). Prominent features include advanced
		Lucene-like querying for specific tokens or contexts (e.g.,
		documents, sentences), similarity statistics for words and
		documents, exporting to DTM for compatibility with many text
		analysis packages, and the possibility to reconstruct original
		text from tokens to facilitate interpretation.
