		Scientific Analysis of Trial Errors (SATE) // Bundles functions
		used to analyze the harmfulness of trial errors in criminal
		trials. Functions in the Scientific Analysis of Trial Errors
		('SATE') package help users estimate the probability that a
		jury will find a defendant guilty given jurors' preferences for
		a guilty verdict and the uncertainty of that estimate. Users
		can also compare actual and hypothetical trial conditions to
		conduct harmful error analysis. The relationship between
		individual jurors' verdict preferences and the probability that
		a jury returns a guilty verdict has been studied by Davis
		(1973) doi:10.1037/h0033951; MacCoun  Kerr (1988)
		doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.1.21, and Devine et el. (2001)
		doi:10.1037/1076-8971.7.3.622, among others.
