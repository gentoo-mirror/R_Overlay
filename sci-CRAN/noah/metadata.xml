		Create Unique Pseudonymous Animal Names // Generate pseudonymous
		animal names that are delightful and easy to remember like the
		Likable Leech and the Proud Chickadee. A unique pseudonym can
		be created for every unique element in a vector or row in a
		data frame. Pseudonyms can be customized and tracked over time,
		so that the same input is always assigned the same pseudonym.
