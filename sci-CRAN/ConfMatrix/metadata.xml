		Confusion Matrix // Thematic quality indices are provided to
		facilitate the evaluation and quality control of geospatial
		data products (e.g. thematic maps, remote sensing
		classifications, etc.). The indices offered are based on the
		so-called confusion matrix. This matrix is constructed by
		comparing the assigned classes or attributes of a set of pairs
		of positions or objects in the product and the ground truth. In
		this package it is considered that the classes of the ground
		truth correspond to the columns and that the classes of the
		product to be valued correspond to the rows. The package offers
		two object classes with their methods: 'ConfMatrix' (Confusion
		matrix) and 'QCCS' (Quality Control Columns Set). The
		'ConfMatrix' class of objects offers more than 20 methods based
		on the confusion matrix. The 'QCCS' class of objects offers a
		different perspective in which the ground truth is considered
		to allow the values of the column marginals to be fixed, see

		et al. (2007) doi:10.1016/j.rse.2006.10.010 for more details.
		The package was created with 'R6'.
