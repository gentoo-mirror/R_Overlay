		Enumeration and Uniform Sampling of Transmission Trees for a
		Known Phylogeny // For a single, known pathogen phylogeny,
		provides functions for enumeration of the set of compatible
		epidemic transmission trees, and for uniform sampling from that
		set. Optional arguments allow for incomplete sampling with a
		known number of missing individuals, multiple sampling, and
		known infection time limits. Always assumed are a complete
		transmission bottleneck and no superinfection or reinfection.
		See Hall and Colijn (2019) doi:10.1093/molbev/msz058 for
		methodology.
