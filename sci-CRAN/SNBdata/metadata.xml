		Download Data from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) // Download data
		(tables and datasets) from the Swiss National Bank (SNB;
		https://www.snb.ch/en), the Swiss central bank.  The package is
		lightweight and comes with few dependencies; suggested packages
		are used only if data is to be transformed into particular data
		structures, for instance into 'zoo' objects.  Downloaded data
		can optionally be cached, to avoid repeated downloads of the
		same files.
