		Measuring Disparity in R // A modular package for measuring
		disparity from multidimensional matrices. Disparity can be
		calculated from any matrix defining a multidimensional space.
		The package provides a set of implemented metrics to measure
		properties of the space and allows users to provide and test
		their own metrics. The package also provides functions for
		looking at disparity in a serial way (e.g. disparity through
		time) or per groups as well as visualising the results.
		Finally, this package provides several basic statistical tests
		for disparity analysis.
