		Measuring Disparity // A modular package for measuring disparity
		from multidimensional matrices. Disparity can be calculated
		from any matrix defining a multidimensional space. The package
		provides a set of implemented metrics to measure properties of
		the space and allows users to provide and test their own
		metrics (Guillerme (2018) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13022). The
		package also provides functions for looking at disparity in a
		serial way (e.g. disparity through time - Guillerme and Cooper
		(2018) doi:10.1111/pala.12364) or per groups as well as
		visualising the results. Finally, this package provides several
		basic statistical tests for disparity analysis.
