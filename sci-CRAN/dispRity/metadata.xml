		Measuring Disparity // A modular package for measuring disparity
		(multidimensional space occupancy). Disparity can be calculated
		from any matrix defining a multidimensional space. The package
		provides a set of implemented metrics to measure properties of
		the space and allows users to provide and test their own
		metrics. The package also provides functions for looking at
		disparity in a serial way (e.g. disparity through time) or per
		groups as well as visualising the results. Finally, this
		package provides several statistical tests for disparity
		analysis.
