		Analysing Non-Verbal Communication in Dyadic Interactions from
		Video Data // Analyzes non-verbal communication by processing
		data extracted from video recordings of dyadic interactions. It
		supports integration with open source tools, currently limited
		to 'OpenPose' (Cao et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2929257), converting its outputs into
		CSV format for further analysis. The package includes functions
		for data pre-processing, visualization, and computation of
		motion indices such as velocity, acceleration, and jerkiness
		(Cook et al. (2013) doi:10.1093/brain/awt208), facilitating the
		analysis of non-verbal cues in paired interactions and
		contributing to research on human communication dynamics.
