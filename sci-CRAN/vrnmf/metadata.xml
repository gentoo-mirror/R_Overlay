		Volume-Regularized Structured Matrix Factorization // Implements
		a set of routines to perform structured matrix factorization
		with minimum volume constraints. The NMF procedure decomposes a
		matrix X into a product C * D. Given conditions such that the
		matrix C is non-negative and has sufficiently spread columns,
		then volume minimization of a matrix D delivers a correct and
		unique, up to a scale and permutation, solution (C, D). This
		package provides both an implementation of volume-regularized
		NMF and "anchor-free" NMF, whereby the standard NMF problem is
		reformulated in the covariance domain. This algorithm was
		applied in Vladimir B. Seplyarskiy Ruslan A. Soldatov, et al.
		"Population sequencing data reveal a compendium of mutational
		processes in the human germ line". Science, 12 Aug 2021.
		doi:10.1126/science.aba7408. This package interacts with data
		available through the 'simulatedNMF' package, which is
		available in a 'drat' repository. To access this data package,
		see the instructions at https://github.com/kharchenkolab/vrnmf.
		The size of the 'simulatedNMF' package is approximately 8 MB.
