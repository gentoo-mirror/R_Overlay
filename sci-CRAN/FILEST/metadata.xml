		Fine-Level Structure Simulator // A population genetic simulator,
		which is able to generate synthetic datasets for single-
		nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for multiple populations. The
		genetic distances among populations can be set according to the
		Fixation Index (Fst) as explained in Balding and Nichols (1995)
		doi:10.1007/BF01441146. This tool is able to simulate outlying
		individuals and missing SNPs can be specified. For Genome-wide
		association study (GWAS), disease status can be set in desired
		level according risk ratio.
