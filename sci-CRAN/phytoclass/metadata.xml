		Estimate Chla Concentrations of Phytoplankton Groups // Determine
		the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations of different
		phytoplankton groups based on their pigment biomarkers. The
		method uses non-negative matrix factorisation and simulated
		annealing to minimise error between the observed and estimated
		values of pigment concentrations (Hayward et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1002/lom3.10541). The approach is similar to the widely
		used 'CHEMTAX' program (Mackey et al. 1996)
		doi:10.3354/meps144265, but is more straightforward, accurate,
		and not reliant on initial guesses for the pigment to Chl a
		ratios for phytoplankton groups.
