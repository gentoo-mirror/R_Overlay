		Variable Selection in a Multivariate Linear Model // It performs
		variable selection in a multivariate linear model by estimating
		the covariance matrix of the residuals then use it to remove
		the dependence that may exist among the responses and
		eventually performs variable selection by using the Lasso
		criterion. The method is described in the paper Perrot-Docks et
		al. (2017) arXiv:1704.00076.
