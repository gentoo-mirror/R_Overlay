		Taba Robust Correlations // Calculates the robust Taba linear,
		Taba rank (monotonic), TabWil, and TabWil rank correlations.
		Test statistics as well as one sided or two sided p-values are
		provided for all correlations. Multiple correlations and
		p-values can be calculated simultaneously across multiple
		variables. In addition, users will have the option to use the
		partial, semipartial, and generalized partial correlations;
		where the partial and semipartial correlations use linear,
		logistic, or Poisson regression to modify the specified
		variable.
