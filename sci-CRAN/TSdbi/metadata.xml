		Time Series Database Interface // Provides a common interface to
		time series databases. The objective is to define a standard
		interface so users can retrieve time series data from various
		sources with a simple, common, set of commands, and so programs
		can be written to be portable with respect to the data source.
		The SQL implementations also provide a database table design,
		so users needing to set up a time series database have a
		reasonably complete way to do this easily. The interface
		provides for a variety of options with respect to the
		representation of time series in R. The interface, and the SQL
		implementations, also handle vintages of time series data
		(sometime called editions or real-time data). There is also a
		(not yet well tested) mechanism to handle multilingual data
		documentation. Comprehensive examples of all the 'TS*' packages
		is provided in the vignette Guide.pdf with the 'TSdata'
		package.
