		Enhancing the 'parallel' Package // Utility functions that
		enhances the 'parallel' packages and that are used for the
		built-in parallel backends of the 'future' package.  For
		example, availableCores() gives the number of CPU cores
		available to your R process as given by relevant R options and
		environment variables including those set by job schedulers on
		high-performance compute clusters. If none is set, it will fall
		back to parallel::detectCores(). Another example is
		makeClusterPSOCK(), which is backward compatible with
		parallel::makePSOCKcluster() while doing a better job in
		setting up a remote cluster workers without the need for
		configuring the firewall to do port-forwarding to your local
		computer.
