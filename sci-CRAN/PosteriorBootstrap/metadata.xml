		Non-Parametric Sampling with Parallel Monte Carlo // An
		implementation of a non-parametric statistical model using a
		parallelised Monte Carlo sampling scheme. The method
		implemented in this package allows non-parametric inference to
		be regularized for small sample sizes, while also being more
		accurate than approximations such as variational Bayes. The
		concentration parameter is an effective sample size parameter,
		determining the faith we have in the model versus the data.
		When the concentration is low, the samples are close to the
		exact Bayesian logistic regression method; when the
		concentration is high, the samples are close to the simplified
		variational Bayes logistic regression. The method is described
		in full in the paper Lyddon, Walker, and Holmes (2018),
		"Nonparametric learning from Bayesian models with randomized
		objective functions" arXiv:1806.11544.
