		Difference-in-Differences with a Continuous Treatment // Provides
		methods for difference-in-differences with a continuous
		treatment and staggered treatment adoption. Includes estimation
		of treatment effects and causal responses as a function of the
		dose, event studies indexed by length of exposure to the
		treatment, and aggregation into overall average effects.
		Uniform inference procedures are included, along with both
		parametric and nonparametric models for treatment effects. The
		methods are based on Callaway, Goodman-Bacon, and Sant'Anna
		(2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2107.02637.
