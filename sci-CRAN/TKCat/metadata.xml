		Tailored Knowledge Catalog // Facilitate the management of data
		from knowledge resources that are frequently used alone or
		together in research environments. In 'TKCat', knowledge
		resources are manipulated as modeled database (MDB) objects.
		These objects provide access to the data tables along with a
		general description of the resource and a detail data model
		documenting the tables, their fields and their relationships.
		These MDB are then gathered in catalogs that can be easily
		explored an shared. Finally, 'TKCat' provides tools to easily
		subset, filter and combine MDBs and create new catalogs suited
		for specific needs.
