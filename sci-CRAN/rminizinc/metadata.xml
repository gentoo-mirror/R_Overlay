		R Interface to Use 'MiniZinc' // Constraint optimization, or
		constraint programming, is the name given to identifying
		feasible solutions out of a very large set of candidates, where
		the problem can be modeled in terms of arbitrary constraints.
		'MiniZinc' is a free and open-source constraint modeling
		language. Constraint satisfaction and discrete optimization
		problems can be formulated in a high-level modeling language.
		Models are compiled into an intermediate representation that is
		understood by a wide range of solvers. 'MiniZinc' itself
		provides several solvers, for instance 'GeCode'. R users can
		use the package to solve constraint programming problems
		without using 'MiniZinc' directly, modify existing 'MiniZinc'
		models and also create their own models.
