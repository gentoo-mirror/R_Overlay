		Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models // Fit Bayesian Gaussian
		graphical models. The methods are separated into two Bayesian
		approaches for inference: hypothesis testing and estimation.
		There are extensions for confirmatory hypothesis testing,
		comparing Gaussian graphical models, and node wise
		predictability. These methods were recently introduced in the
		Gaussian graphical model literature, including Williams (2019)
