		A Shiny Interface for Simple Data Management // Launches a shiny
		application generating code to view tables in several ways,
		import/export tables, modify tables, make some basic graphics.
		'IGoR' is a graphic user interface designed to help beginners
		using simple functions around table management and exploration.
		Inspired by 'Rcmdr', 'IGoR' is a code generator that, with
		simple inputs under a Shiny application, provides R code mainly
		built around the 'tidyverse' or some packages in the direct
		line of the Mosaic project: the 'rio' and 'ggformula' packages.
		The generated code doesn't depend on IGoR and can be manually
		modified by the user or copied elsewhere.
