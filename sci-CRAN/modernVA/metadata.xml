		An Implementation of Two Modern Education-Based Value-Added
		Models // Provides functions that fit two modern education-
		based value-added models. One of these models is the quantile
		value-added model.  This model permits estimating a school's
		value-added based on specific quantiles of the post-test
		distribution.  Estimating value-added based on quantiles of the
		post-test distribution provides a more complete picture of an
		education institution's contribution to learning for students
		of all abilities. See Page, G.L.; San Martn, E.; Orellana, J.;
		Gonzalez, J. (2017) doi:10.1111/rssa.12195 for more details.
		The second model is a temporally dependent value-added model.
		This model takes into account the temporal dependence that may
		exist in school performance  between two cohorts in one of two
		ways.  The first is by modeling school  random effects with a
		non-stationary AR(1) process.  The second is by  modeling
		school effects based on previous cohort's post-test
		performance. In addition to more efficiently estimating value-
		added, this model permits making statements about the
		persistence of a schools effectiveness. The standard  value-
		added model is also an option.
