		Bivariate Alternating Recurrent Event Data Analysis //
		Alternating recurrent event data arise frequently in biomedical
		and social sciences where 2 types of events such as hospital
		admissions and discharge occur alternatively over time. As such
		we implement a collection of non-parametric and semiparametric
		methods to analyze such data. The main functions are
		biv.rec.fit() and biv.rec.np(). Use biv.rec.fit() for
		estimation of covariate effects on the two alternating event
		gap times (xij and yij) using semiparametric methods. The
		method options are "Lee.et.al" and "Chang". Use biv.rec.np()
		for estimation of the joint cumulative distribution function
		(cdf) for the two alternating events gap times (xij and yij) as
		well as the marginal survival function for type I gap times
		(xij) and the conditional cdf of the type II gap times (yij)
		given an interval of type I gap times (xij) in a non-parametric
		fashion. The package also provides options to simulate and
		visualize the data and results of analysis.
