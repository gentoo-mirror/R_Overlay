		Simple Tabulation Made Simple // Simple tabulation should be dead
		simple. This package is an opinionated approach to easy
		tabulations while also providing exact numbers and allowing for
		re-usability. This is achieved by providing tabulations as
		data.frames with columns for values, optional variable names,
		frequency counts including and excluding NAs and percentages
		for counts including and excluding NAs. Also values are
		automatically sorted by in decreasing order of frequency counts
		to allow for fast skimming of the most important information.
