		Fitting and Predicting Large-Scale Nonlinear Regression Problems
		using Multi-Resolution Functional ANOVA (MRFA) Approach //
		Performs the MRFA approach proposed by Sung et al. (2019+)
		arXiv:1709.07064 to fit and predict nonlinear regression
		problems, particularly for large-scale and high-dimensional
		problems. The application includes deterministic or stochastic
		computer experiments, spatial datasets, and so on.
