		Fitting and Predicting Large-Scale Nonlinear Regression Problems
		using Multi-Resolution Functional ANOVA (MRFA) Approach //
		Performs the MRFA approach proposed by Sung et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1595630 to fit and predict nonlinear
		regression problems, particularly for large-scale and high-
		dimensional problems. The application includes deterministic or
		stochastic computer experiments, spatial datasets, and so on.
