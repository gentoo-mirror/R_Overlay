		Computations over Distributed Data without Aggregation //
		Implementing algorithms and fitting models when sites (possibly
		remote) share computation summaries rather than actual data
		over HTTP with a master R process (using 'opencpu', for
		example). A stratified Cox model and a singular value
		decomposition are provided. The former makes direct use of code
		from the R 'survival' package. (That is, the underlying Cox
		model code is derived from that in the R 'survival' package.)
		Sites may provide data via several means: CSV files, Redcap
		API, etc. An extensible design allows for new methods to be
		added in the future and includes facilities for local
		prototyping and testing. Web applications are provided (via
		'shiny') for the implemented methods to help in designing and
		deploying the computations.
