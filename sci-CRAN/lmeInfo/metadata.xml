		Information Matrices for 'lmeStruct' and 'glsStruct' Objects //
		Provides analytic derivatives and information matrices for
		fitted linear mixed effects (lme) models and generalized least
		squares (gls) models estimated using lme() (from package
		'nlme') and gls() (from package 'nlme'), respectively. The
		package includes functions for estimating the sampling
		variance-covariance of variance component parameters using the
		inverse Fisher information. The variance components include the
		parameters of the random effects structure (for lme models),
		the variance structure, and the correlation structure. The
		expected and average forms of the Fisher information matrix are
		used in the calculations, and models estimated by full maximum
		likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood are supported. The
		package also includes a function for estimating standardized
		mean difference effect sizes (Pustejovsky, Hedges, and Shadish
		(2014) DOI:10.3102/1076998614547577) based on fitted lme or gls
		models.
