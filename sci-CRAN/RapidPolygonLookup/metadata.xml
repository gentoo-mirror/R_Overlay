		POLYGON LOOKUP USING KD TREES // Facilitates efficient polygon
		search using kd trees. Coordinate level spatial data can be
		aggregated to higher geographical identities like census
		blocks, ZIP codes or police district boundaries. This process
		requires mapping each point in the given data set to a
		particular identity of the desired geographical hierarchy.
		Unless efficient data structures are used, this can be a
		daunting task. The operation point.in.polygon() from the
		package sp is computationally expensive. Here, we exploit kd-
		trees as efficient nearest neighbor search algorithm to
		dramatically reduce the effective number of polygons being
		searched.
