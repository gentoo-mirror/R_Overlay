		Small Area Estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian under Zero
		Inflated Negative Binomial Distribution // We designed this
		package to provide a function for area level of small area
		estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method under Zero
		Inflated Negative Binomial Distribution. This package provides
		model using Univariate Zero Inflated Negative Binomial
		Distribution for variable of interest. This package also
		provides a dataset produced by a data generation. The 'rjags'
		package is employed to obtain parameter estimates. Model-based
		estimators involves the HB estimators which include the mean
		and the variation of mean, and the quantile. For the reference,
		see Rao,J.N.K  Molina (2015) doi:10.1002/9781118735855.
