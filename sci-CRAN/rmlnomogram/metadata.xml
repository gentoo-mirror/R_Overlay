		Construct Explainable Nomogram for a Machine Learning Model //
		Construct an explainable nomogram for a machine learning (ML)
		model to improve availability of an ML prediction model in
		addition to a computer application, particularly in a situation
		where a computer, a mobile phone, an internet connection, or
		the application accessibility are unreliable. This package
		enables a nomogram creation for any ML prediction models, which
		is conventionally limited to only a linear/logistic regression
		model. This nomogram may indicate the explainability value per
		feature, e.g., the Shapley additive explanation value, for each
		individual. However, this package only allows a nomogram
		creation for a model using categorical without or with single
		numerical predictors. Detailed methodologies and examples are
		documented in our vignette, available at https://htmlpreview.gi
		thub.io/?https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana/rmlnomogram/blo
		b/master/doc/ml_nomogram_exemplar.html.
