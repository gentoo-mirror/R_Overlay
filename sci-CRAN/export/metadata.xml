		Streamlined Export of Graphs and Data Tables // Easily export 'R'
		graphs and statistical output to 'Microsoft Office' /
		'LibreOffice', 'Latex' and 'HTML' Documents, using sensible
		defaults that result in publication-quality output with simple,
		straightforward commands. Output to 'Microsoft Office' is in
		editable 'DrawingML' vector format for graphs, and can use
		corporate template documents for styling. This enables the
		production of standardized reports and also allows for manual
		tidy-up of the layout of 'R' graphs in 'Powerpoint' before
		final publication. Export of graphs is flexible, and functions
		enable the currently showing R graph or the currently showing
		'R' stats object to be exported, but also allow the graphical
		or tabular output to be passed as objects. The package relies
		on package 'officer' for export to 'Office' documents,and
		output files are also fully compatible with 'LibreOffice'. Base
		'R', 'ggplot2' and 'lattice' plots are supported, as well as a
		wide variety of 'R' stats objects, via wrappers to xtable(),
		broom::tidy() and stargazer(), including aov(), lm(), glm(),
		lme(), glmnet() and coxph() as well as matrices and data frames
		and many more...
