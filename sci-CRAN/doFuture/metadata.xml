		Use Foreach to Parallelize via the Future Framework // The
		'future' package provides a unifying parallelization framework
		for R that supports many parallel and distributed backends
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048. The 'foreach' package provides a
		powerful API for iterating over an R expression in parallel.
		The 'doFuture' package brings the best of the two together.
		There are two alternative ways to use this package. The
		recommended approach is to use 'y - foreach(...) %dofuture% {
		... }', which does not require using 'registerDoFuture()' and
		has many advantages over '%dopar%'. The alternative is the
		traditional 'foreach' approach by registering the 'foreach'
		adapter 'registerDoFuture()' and so that 'y - foreach(...)
		%dopar% { ... }' runs in parallelizes with the 'future'
		framework.
