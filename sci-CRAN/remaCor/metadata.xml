		Random Effects Meta-Analysis for Correlated Test Statistics //
		Meta-analysis is widely used to summarize estimated effects
		sizes across multiple statistical tests. Standard fixed and
		random effect meta-analysis methods assume that the estimated
		of the effect sizes are statistically independent.  Here we
		relax this assumption and enable meta-analysis when the
		correlation matrix between effect size estimates is known.
		Fixed effect meta-analysis uses the method of Lin and Sullivan
		(2009) doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.11.001, and random effects meta-
		analysis uses the method of Han, et al. doi:10.1093/hmg/ddw049.
