		Fast Moving Statistics Calculation // Provides several efficient
		functions to calculate common moving (or rolling, running)
		statistics for both evenly and unevenly spaced time series:
		moving average, moving median, moving maximum (minimum), and so
		on. Built on 'C++', these functions are apparently more
		efficient than those written in a traditional 'R' way and also
		faster than others using package 'Rcpp'.
