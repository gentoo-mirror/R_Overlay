		Minimal R/Shiny Interface to JavaScript Library 'ECharts' // The
		goal is to deliver the full functionality of 'ECharts' with
		minimal overhead. 'ECharts' is based on data structures and
		'echarty' users build R lists for these same data structures.
		One to three 'echarty' commands are usually sufficient to
		produce any chart.
