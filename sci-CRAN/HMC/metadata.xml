		High Dimensional Mean Comparison with Projection and Cross-
		Fitting // Provides interpretable High-dimensional Mean
		Comparison methods (HMC). For example, users can use them to
		assess the difference in gene expression between two treatment
		groups. It is not a gene-by-gene comparison. Instead, we focus
		on the interplay between features and are interested in those
		that are predictive of the group label. The methods are valid
		frequentist tests and give sparse estimates indicating which
		features contribute to the test results.
