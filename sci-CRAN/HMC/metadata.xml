		High-Dimensional Mean Comparison with Projection and Cross-
		Fitting // Provides interpretable high-dimensional mean
		comparison methods (HMC). For example, users can apply these
		methods to assess the difference in gene expression between two
		treatment groups. It is not a gene-by-gene comparison. Instead,
		the methods focus on the interplay between features and
		identify those that are predictive of the group label. The
		tests are valid frequentist procedures and yield sparse
		estimates indicating which features contribute to the group
		differences.
