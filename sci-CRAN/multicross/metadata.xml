		A Graph-Based Test for Comparing Multivariate Distributions in
		the Multi Sample Framework // We introduce a nonparametric,
		graphical test based on optimal matching for assessing whether
		multiple unknown multivariate probability distributions are
		equal. This method is consistent, and does not make any
		distributional assumptions on the data. Our procedure combines
		data that belong to different classes or groups to create a
		graph on the pooled data, and then utilizes the number of edges
		connecting data points from different classes to examine
		equality of distributions among the classes. The functions
		available through this package implement the work described
		here: arXiv:1906.04776.
