		Identify the Racial Complex of Native Corns from Mexico // A
		model that provides researchers with a powerful tool for the
		classification and study of native corn by aiding in the
		identification of racial complexes which are fundamental to
		Mexico's agriculture and culture. This package has been
		developed based on data collected by "Proyecto Global de Maces
		Nativos Mxico", which has conducted exhaustive surveys across
		the country to document the qualitative and quantitative
		characteristics of different types of native maize. The trained
		model uses a robust and diverse dataset, enabling it to achieve
		an 80% accuracy in classifying maize racial complexes. The
		characteristics included in the analysis comprise geographic
		location, grain and cob colors, as well as various physical
		measurements, such as lengths and widths.
