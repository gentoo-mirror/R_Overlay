		Flexible Framework for Developing Spatial Interaction Models //
		Develop spatial interaction models (SIMs).  SIMs predict the
		amount of interaction, for example number of trips per day,
		between geographic entities representing trip origins and
		destinations. Contains functions for creating origin-
		destination datasets from geographic input datasets and
		calculating movement between origin-destination pairs with
		constrained, production-constrained, and attraction-constrained
		models (Wilson 1979) doi:10.1068/a030001.
