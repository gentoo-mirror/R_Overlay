		The Short-Term and Long-Term Hazard Ratio Model with Proportional
		Adjustment // Provides covariate-adjusted comparison of two
		groups of right censored data, where the binary group variable
		has separate short-term and long-term effects on the hazard
		function, while effects of covariates such as age, blood
		pressure, etc. are proportional on the hazard. The model was
		studied in Yang and Prentice (2015) doi:10.1002/sim.6453 and it
		extends the two sample version of the short-term and long-term
		hazard ratio model proposed in Yang and Prentice (2005)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/92.1.1. The model extends the usual Cox
		proportional hazards model to allow more flexible hazard ratio
		patterns, such as gradual onset of effect, diminishing effect,
		and crossing hazard or survival functions. This package
		provides the following: 1) point estimates and confidence
		intervals for model parameters; 2) point estimate and
		confidence interval of the average hazard ratio; and 3) plots
		of estimated hazard ratio function with point-wise and
		simultaneous confidence bands.
