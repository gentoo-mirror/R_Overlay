		Composable Preprocessing Operators and Pipelines for Machine
		Learning // Toolset that enriches 'mlr' with a diverse set of
		preprocessing operators. Composable Preprocessing Operators
		("CPO"s) are first-class R objects that can be applied to
		data.frames and 'mlr' "Task"s to modify data, can be attached
		to 'mlr' "Learner"s to add preprocessing to machine learning
		algorithms, and can be composed to form preprocessing
		pipelines.
