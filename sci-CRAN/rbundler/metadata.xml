		Rbundler manages an application's dependencies systematically and
		repeatedly. // Rbundler manages a project-specific library for
		dependency package installation. By specifying dependencies in
		a DESCRIPTION file in a project's root directory, one may
		install and use dependencies in a repeatable fashion without
		requiring manual maintenance. rbundler creates a project-
		specific R library in `PROJECT_ROOT/.Rbundle` (by default) and
		a project-specific `R_LIBS_USER` value, set in
		`PROJECT_ROOT/.Renviron`. It supports dependency management for
		R standard "Depends", "Imports", "Suggests", and "LinkingTo"
		package dependencies. rbundler also attempts to validate and
		install versioned dependencies, such as "=", "==", "=". Note
		that, due to the way R manages package installation, differing
		nested versioned dependencies are not allowed. For example, if
		your project depends on packages A (== 1), and B (== 2), but
		package A depends on B (== 1), then a nested dependency
		violation will cause rbundler to error out.
