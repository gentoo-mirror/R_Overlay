		Estimates Parameters of Functions Driving Binomial Random
		Variables // Provides maximum likelihood estimates of the
		performance parameters that drive a binomial distribution of
		observed errors, and takes full advantage of zero error
		observations. High performance communications systems typically
		have inherent noise sources and other performance limitations
		that need to be estimated. Measurements made at high signal to
		noise ratios typically result in zero errors due to limitation
		in available measurement time. Package includes theoretical
		performance functions for common modulation schemes (Proakis,
		"Digital Communications" (1995, ISBN:0-07-051726-6)),
		polarization shifted QPSK (Agrell  Karlsson (2009,
		DOI:10.1109/JLT.2009.2029064)), and utility functions to work
		with the performance functions.
