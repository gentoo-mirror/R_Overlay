		Adapt Numerical Records to Fit (in)Equality Restrictions //
		Minimally adjust the values of numerical records in a
		data.frame, such that each record satisfies a predefined set of
		equality and/or inequality constraints. The constraints can be
		defined using the 'validate' package. The core algorithms have
		recently been moved to the 'lintools' package, refer to
		'lintools' for a more basic interface and access to a version
		of the algorithm that works with sparse matrices.
