		A Light-Weight, Portable Tool for Reviewing Individual Patient
		Records // A portable Shiny tool to explore patient-level
		electronic health record data and perform chart review in a
		single integrated framework. This tool supports browsing
		clinical data in many different formats including multiple
		versions of the 'OMOP' common data model as well as the 'MIMIC-
		III' data model. In addition, chart review information is
		captured and stored securely via the Shiny interface in a
		'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data Capture) project using the
		'REDCap' API. See the 'ReviewR' website for additional
		information, documentation, and examples.
