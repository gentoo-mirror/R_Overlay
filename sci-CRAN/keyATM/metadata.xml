		Keyword Assisted Topic Models // Fits keyword assisted topic
		models (keyATM) using collapsed Gibbs samplers. The keyATM
		combines the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) models with a
		small number of keywords selected by researchers in order to
		improve the interpretability and topic classification of the
		LDA. The keyATM can also incorporate covariates and directly
		model time trends. The keyATM is proposed in Eshima, Imai, and
		Sasaki (2020) arXiv:2004.05964.
