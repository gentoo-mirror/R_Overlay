		Conditional Multivariate Reference Regions // An R package for
		estimating conditional multivariate reference regions. The
		reference region is non parametrically estimated using a kernel
		density estimator. Covariates effects on the multivariate
		response means vector and variance-covariance matrix, thus on
		the region shape, are estimated by flexible additive
		predictors. Continuous covariates non linear effects might be
		estimated using penalized splines smoothers. Confidence
		intervals for the covariates estimated effects might be derived
		from bootstrap resampling. Kernel density bandwidth can be
		estimated with different methods, including a method that
		optimize the region coverage. Numerical, and graphical,
		summaries can be obtained by the user in order to evaluate
		reference region performance with real data. Full mathematical
		details can be found in doi:10.1007/s00477-020-01901-1.
