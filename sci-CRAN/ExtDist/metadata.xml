		Extending the Range of Functions for Probability Distributions //
		A consistent, unified and extensible framework for estimation
		of parameters for probability distributions, including
		parameter estimation procedures that allow for weighted
		samples; the current set of distributions included are: the
		standard beta, The four-parameter beta, Burr, gamma, Gumbel,
		Johnson SB and SU, Laplace, logistic, normal, symmetric
		truncated normal, truncated normal, symmetric-reflected
		truncated beta, standard symmetric-reflected truncated beta,
		triangular, uniform, and Weibull distributions; decision
		criteria and selections based on these decision criteria.
