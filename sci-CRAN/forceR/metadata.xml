		Force Measurement Analyses // For cleaning and analysis of
		graphs, such as animal closing force measurements. 'forceR' was
		initially written and optimized to deal with insect bite force
		measurements, but can be used for any time series. Includes a
		full workflow to load, plot and crop data, correct amplifier
		and baseline drifts, identify individual peak shapes (bites),
		rescale (normalize) peak curves, and find best polynomial fits
		to describe and analyze force curve shapes.
