		Sparse Group Variable Selection for Gene-Environment Interactions
		in the Longitudinal Study // Recently, regularized variable
		selection has emerged as a powerful tool to identify and
		dissect gene-environment interactions. Nevertheless, in
		longitudinal studies with high dimensional genetic factors,
		regularization methods for GE interactions have not been
		systematically developed. In this package, we provide the
		implementation of sparse group variable selection, based on
		both the quadratic inference function (QIF) and generalized
		estimating equation (GEE), to accommodate the bi-level
		selection for longitudinal GE studies with high dimensional
		genomic features. Alternative methods conducting only the group
		or individual level selection have also been included. The core
		modules of the package have been developed in C++.
