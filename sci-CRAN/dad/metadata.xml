		Three-Way Data Analysis Through Densities // The three-way data
		consists of a set of variables measured on several groups of
		individuals. To each group is associated an estimated
		probability density function. The package provides tools to
		manage such data and functional methods (principal component
		analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis,
		discriminant analysis...) for such probability densities.
