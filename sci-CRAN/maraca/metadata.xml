		The Maraca Plot: Visualization of Hierarchical Composite
		Endpoints in Clinical Trials // Library that supports visual
		interpretation of hierarchical composite endpoints (HCEs). HCEs
		are complex constructs used as primary endpoints in clinical
		trials, combining outcomes of different types into ordinal
		endpoints, in which each patient contributes the most
		clinically important event (one and only one) to the analysis.
