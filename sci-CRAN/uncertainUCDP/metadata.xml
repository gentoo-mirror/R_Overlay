		Parametric Mixture Models for Uncertainty Estimation of
		Fatalities in UCDP Conflict Data // Provides functions for
		estimating uncertainty in the number of fatalities in the
		Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) data. The package
		implements a parametric reported-value Gumbel mixture
		distribution that accounts for the uncertainty in the number of
		fatalities in the UCDP data. The model is based on information
		from a survey on UCDP coders and how they view the uncertainty
		of the number of fatalities from UCDP events. The package
		provides functions for making random draws of fatalities from
		the mixture distribution, as well as to estimate percentiles,
		quantiles, means, and other statistics of the distribution.
		Full details on the survey and estimation procedure can be
		found in Vesco et al (2024).
