		Unbiased Cell Type Identification of Single-Cell Transcriptomic
		Data // A typical computational pipeline to process single-cell
		RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data  involves clustering of cells.
		Assignment of cell type labels to those clusters is often a
		time-consuming process that involves manual inspection of the
		cluster marker genes complemented with a detailed literature
		search. This is especially challenging if you are not familiar
		with all the captured subpopulations or have unexpected
		contaminants. 'clustermole' provides a comprehensive meta
		collection of cell identity markers for thousands of human and
		mouse cell types sourced from a variety of databases as well as
		methods to query them.
