		Unbiased Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data Cell Type Identification
		// Assignment of cell type labels to single-cell RNA sequencing
		(scRNA-seq) clusters is often a time-consuming process that
		involves manual inspection of the cluster marker genes
		complemented with a detailed literature search. This is
		especially challenging when unexpected or poorly described
		populations are present. The clustermole R package provides
		methods to query thousands of human and mouse cell identity
		markers sourced from a variety of databases.
