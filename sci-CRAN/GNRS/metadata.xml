		Access the 'Geographic Name Resolution Service' // Provides tools
		for interacting with the 'geographic name resolution service'
		('GNRS') API https://github.com/ojalaquellueva/gnrs and
		associated functionality. The 'GNRS' is a batch application for
		resolving  standardizing political division names against
		standard name in the geonames database
		http://www.geonames.org/. The 'GNRS' resolves political
		division names at three levels: country, state/province and
		county/parish. Resolution is performed in a series of steps,
		beginning with direct matching to standard names, followed by
		direct matching to alternate names in different languages,
		followed by direct matching to standard codes (such as ISO and
		FIPS codes). If direct matching fails, the 'GNRS' attempts to
		match to standard and then alternate names using fuzzy
		matching, but does not perform fuzzing matching of political
		division codes. The 'GNRS' works down the political division
		hierarchy, stopping at the current level if all matches fail.
		In other words, if a country cannot be matched, the 'GNRS' does
		not attempt to match state or county.
