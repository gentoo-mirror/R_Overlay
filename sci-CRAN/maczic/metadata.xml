		Mediation Analysis for Count and Zero-Inflated Count Data //
		Performs causal mediation analysis for count and zero-inflated
		count data without or with a post-treatment confounder;
		calculates power to detect prespecified causal mediation
		effects, direct effects, and total effects; performs
		sensitivity analysis when there is a treatment- induced
		mediator-outcome confounder as described by Cheng, J., Cheng,
		N.F., Guo, Z., Gregorich, S., Ismail, A.I., Gansky, S.A. (2018)
		doi:10.1177/0962280216686131. Implements Instrumental Variable
		(IV) method to estimate the controlled (natural) direct and
		mediation effects, and compute the bootstrap Confidence
		Intervals as described by Guo, Z., Small, D.S., Gansky, S.A.,
		Cheng, J. (2018) doi:10.1111/rssc.12233. This software was made
		possible by Grant R03DE028410 from the National Institute of
		Dental and Craniofacial Research, a component of the National
		Institutes of Health.
