		A C++11 Interface for R's C Interface // Provides a header only,
		C++11 interface to R's C interface.  Compared to other
		approaches 'cpp11' strives to be safe against long jumps from
		the C API as well as C++ exceptions, conform to normal R
		function semantics and supports interaction with 'ALTREP'
		vectors.
