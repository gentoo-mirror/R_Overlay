		The Generalized Pairs Plot // Offers a generalization of the
		scatterplot matrix based on the recognition that most datasets
		include both categorical and quantitative information.
		Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important
		features of the data when one or more variables are categorical
		but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a
		range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and
		quantitative variables. Emerson et al. (2013)
