		Statistical Inference for Partially Observed Markov Processes //
		Tools for data analysis with partially observed Markov process
		(POMP) models (also known as stochastic dynamical systems,
		hidden Markov models, and nonlinear, non-Gaussian, state-space
		models).  The package provides facilities for implementing POMP
		models, simulating them, and fitting them to time series data
		by a variety of frequentist and Bayesian methods.  It is also a
		versatile platform for implementation of inference methods for
		general POMP models.
