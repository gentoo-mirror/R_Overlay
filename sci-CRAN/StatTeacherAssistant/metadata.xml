		An App that Assists Intro Statistics Instructors with Data Sets
		// Includes an interactive application designed to support
		educators in wide-ranging disciplines, with a particular focus
		on those teaching introductory statistical methods (descriptive
		and/or inferential) for data analysis. Users are able to
		randomly generate data, make new versions of existing data
		through common adjustments (e.g., add random normal noise and
		perform transformations), and check the suitability of the
		resulting data for statistical analyses.
