		Tensor Noise Reduction and Completion Methods // Efficient
		algorithms for tensor noise reduction and completion. This
		package includes a suite of parametric and nonparametric tools
		for estimating tensor signals from noisy, possibly incomplete
		observations. The methods allow a broad range of data types,
		including continuous, binary, and ordinal-valued tensor
		entries. The algorithms employ the alternating optimization.
		The detailed algorithm description can be found in the
		following three references.
