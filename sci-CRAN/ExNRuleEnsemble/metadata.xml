		A k Nearest Neibour Ensemble Based on Extended Neighbourhood Rule
		// The extended neighbourhood rule for the k nearest neighbour
		ensemble where the neighbours are determined in k steps.
		Starting from the first nearest observation of the test point,
		the algorithm identifies a single observation that is closest
		to the observation at the previous step. At each base learner
		in the ensemble, this search is extended to k steps on a random
		bootstrap sample with a random subset of features selected from
		the feature space. The final predicted class of the test point
		is determined by using a majority vote in the predicted classes
		given by all base models. Amjad Ali, Muhammad Hamraz, Naz Gul,
