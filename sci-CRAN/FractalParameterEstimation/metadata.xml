		Simulation and Parameter Estimation of Randomized Sierpinski
		Carpets using the p-p-p-q-Model // The parameters p and q are
		estimated with the aid of a randomized Sierpinski Carpet which
		is built on a [p-p-p-q]-model. Thereby, for three times a
		simulation with a p-value and once with a q-value is assumed.
		Hence, these parameters are estimated and displayed. Moreover,
		functions for simulating random Sierpinski-Carpets with
		constant and variable probabilities are included.
