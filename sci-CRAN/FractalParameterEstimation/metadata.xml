		Estimation of Parameters p and q for Randomized Sierpinski Carpet
		for p-p-p-q-Model // The parameters p and q are estimated with
		the aid of a randomized Sierpinski Carpet which is built on a
		[p-p-p-q]-model. Thereby, for three times a simulation with a
		p-value and once with a q-value is assumed. Hence, these
		parameters are estimated and displayed. Moreover, a function
		for simulating random Sierpinski-Carpets is included.
