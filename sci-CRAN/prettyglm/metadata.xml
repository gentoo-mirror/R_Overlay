		Pretty Summaries of Generalized Linear Model Coefficients // One
		of the main advantages of using Generalised Linear Models is
		their interpretability.  The goal of 'prettyglm' is to provide
		a set of functions which easily create beautiful coefficient
		summaries which can readily be shared and explained.
		'prettyglm' helps users create coefficient summaries which
		include categorical base levels, variable importance and type
		III p.values. 'prettyglm' also creates beautiful relativity
		plots for categorical, continuous and splined coefficients.
