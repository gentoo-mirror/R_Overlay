		Permutation Test for Comparing Restricted Mean Survival Time //
		Performs the permutation test using difference in the
		restricted mean survival time (RMST) between groups as a
		summary measure of the survival time distribution. When the
		sample size is less than 50 per group, it has been shown that
		there is non-negligible inflation of the type I error rate in
		the commonly used asymptotic test for the RMST comparison.
		Generally, permutation tests can be useful in such a situation.
		However, when we apply the permutation test for the RMST
		comparison, particularly in small sample situations, there are
		some cases where the survival function in either group cannot
		be defined due to censoring in the permutation process.
		Horiguchi and Uno (2020) doi:10.1002/sim.8565 have examined six
		workable solutions to handle this numerical issue. It performs
		permutation tests with implementation of the six methods
		outlined in the paper when the numerical issue arises during
		the permutation process. The result of the asymptotic test is
		also provided for a reference.
