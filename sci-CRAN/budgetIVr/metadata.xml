		Partial Identification of Causal Effects with Mostly Invalid
		Instruments // A tuneable and interpretable method for relaxing
		the instrumental variables (IV) assumptions to infer treatment
		effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. For a
		treatment-associated covariate to be a valid IV, it must be (a)
		unconfounded with the outcome and (b) have a causal effect on
		the outcome that is exclusively mediated by the exposure. There
		is no general test of the validity of these IV assumptions for
		any particular pre-treatment covariate. However, if different
		pre-treatment covariates give differing causal effect estimates
		when treated as IVs, then we know at least some of the
		covariates violate these assumptions. 'budgetIVr' exploits this
		fact by taking as input a minimum budget of pre-treatment
		covariates assumed to be valid IVs and idenfiying the set of
		causal effects that are consistent with the user's data and
		budget assumption. The following generalizations of this
		principle can be used in this package: (1) a vector of multiple
		budgets can be assigned alongside corresponding thresholds that
		model degrees of IV invalidity; (2) budgets and thresholds can
		be chosen using specialist knowledge or varied in a principled
		sensitivity analysis; (3) treatment effects can be nonlinear
		and/or depend on multiple exposures (at a computational cost).
		The methods in this package require only summary statistics.
		Confidence sets are constructed under the "no measurement
		error" (NOME) assumption from the Mendelian randomization
		literature. For further methodological details, please refer to
