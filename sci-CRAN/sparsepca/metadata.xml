		Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) // Sparse principal
		component analysis (SPCA) attempts to find sparse weight
		vectors (loadings), i.e., a weight vector with only a few
		'active' (nonzero) values. This approach provides better
		interpretability for the principal components in high-
		dimensional data settings. This is, because the principal
		components are formed as a linear combination of only a few of
		the original variables. This package provides efficient
		routines to compute SPCA. Specifically, a variable projection
		solver is used to compute the sparse solution. In addition, a
		fast randomized accelerated SPCA routine and a robust SPCA
		routine is provided. Robust SPCA allows to capture grossly
		corrupted entries in the data. The methods are discussed in
		detail by N. Benjamin Erichson et al. (2018) arXiv:1804.00341.
