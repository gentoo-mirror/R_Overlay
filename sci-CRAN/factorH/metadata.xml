		Multifactor Nonparametric Rank-Based ANOVA with Post Hoc Tests //
		Multifactor nonparametric analysis of variance based on ranks.
		Builds on the Kruskal-Wallis H test and its 2x2 Scheirer-Ray-
		Hare extension to handle any factorial designs. Provides effect
		sizes, Dunn-Bonferroni pairwise-comparison matrices, and
		simple-effects analyses. Tailored for psychology and the social
		sciences, with beginner-friendly R syntax and outputs that can
		be dropped into journal reports. Includes helpers to export
		tab-separated results and compact tables of descriptive
		statistics (to APA-style reports).
