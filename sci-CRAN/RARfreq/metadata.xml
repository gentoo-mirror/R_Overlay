		Response Adaptive Randomization with 'Frequentist' Approach //
		Provides functions and command-line user interface to generate
		allocation sequence by response-adaptive randomization for
		clinical trials. The package currently supports two response-
		adaptive randomization procedures, Doubly Adaptive Biased Coin
		Design ('DBCD') and Sequential Estimation-adjusted Urn Model
		('SEU'), for two endpoints, binary and normal. One-sided
		proportion (or mean) difference and Chi-square (or 'ANOVA')
		hypothesis testing methods are also available in the package to
		facilitate the inference for treatment effect under different
		sample sizes and the inference for sample size under different
		treatment effects. Additionally, the package provides
		comprehensive and efficient tools to allow one to evaluate and
		compare the performance of randomization procedures and tests
		based on various criteria. Five allocation functions for 'DBCD'
		and six addition rule functions for 'SEU' are implemented to
		target allocations such as 'Neyman', 'Rosenberger' and 'Urn'
		allocations.
