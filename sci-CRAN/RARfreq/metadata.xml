		Response Adaptive Randomization with 'Frequentist' Approaches //
		Provides functions and command-line user interface to generate
		allocation sequence by response-adaptive randomization for
		clinical trials. The package currently supports two families of
		frequentist response-adaptive randomization procedures, Doubly
		Adaptive Biased Coin Design ('DBCD') and Sequential Estimation-
		adjusted Urn Model ('SEU'), for binary and normal endpoints.
		One-sided proportion (or mean) difference and Chi-square (or
		'ANOVA') hypothesis testing methods are also available in the
		package to  facilitate the inference for treatment effect.
		Additionally, the package provides comprehensive and efficient
		tools to allow one to evaluate and  compare the performance of
		randomization procedures and tests based on various criteria.
		For example, plots for relationship among assumed treatment
		effects,  sample size, and power are provided. Five allocation
		functions for 'DBCD' and six addition rule functions for 'SEU'
		are implemented to target allocations such as 'Neyman',
		'Rosenberger' Rosenberger et al. (2001)
		doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00909.x and 'Urn' allocations.
