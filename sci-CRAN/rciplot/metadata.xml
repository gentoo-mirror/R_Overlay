		Plot Jacobson-Truax Reliable Change Indices // The concept of
		reliable and clinically significant change (Jacobson  Truax,
		1991) helps you answer the following questions for a sample
		with two measurements at different points in time (pre  post):
		Which proportion of my sample has a (considering the
		reliability of the instrument) probably not-just-by-chance
		difference in pre- vs. post-scores? Which proportion of my
		sample does not only change in a statistically significant way
		(see question one), but also in a clinically significant way
		(e.g. change from a test score regarded "dysfunctional" to a
		score regarded "functional")? This package allows you to very
		easily create a scatterplot of your sample in which the x-axis
		maps to the pre-scores, the y-axis maps to the post-scores and
		several graphical elements (lines, colors) allow you to gain a
		quick overview about reliable changes in these scores. An
		example of this kind of plot is Figure 2 of Jacobson  Truax
		(1991). Referenced article: Jacobson, N. S.,  Truax, P. (1991)
		doi:10.1037/0022-006X.59.1.12.
