		Calculate Power and Sample Size with Beta Regression // Power
		calculations are a critical component of any research study to
		determine the minimum sample size necessary to detect
		differences between multiple groups. Researchers often work
		with data taking the form of proportions that can be modeled
		with a beta distribution. Here we present an R package,
		'BetaPASS', that perform power and sample size calculations for
		data following a beta distribution with comparative
		nonparametric output. This package allows flexibility with
		multiple options for link functions to fit the data and
		graphing functionality for visual comparisons.
