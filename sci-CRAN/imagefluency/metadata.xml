		Image Statistics Based on Processing Fluency // Get image
		statistics based on processing fluency theory. The functions
		provide scores for several basic aesthetic principles that
		facilitate fluent cognitive processing of images: contrast,
		complexity / simplicity, self-similarity, symmetry, and
		typicality. See Mayer  Landwehr (2018) doi:10.1037/aca0000187
		and Mayer  Landwehr (2018) doi:10.31219/osf.io/gtbhw for the
		theoretical background of the methods.
