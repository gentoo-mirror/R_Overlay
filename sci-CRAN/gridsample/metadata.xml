		Tools for Grid-Based Survey Sampling Design // Multi-stage
		cluster surveys of households are commonly performed by
		governments and programmes to monitor population-level
		demographic, social, economic, and health outcomes. Generally,
		communities are sampled from subpopulations (strata) in a first
		stage, and then households are listed and sampled in a second
		stage. In this typical two-stage design, sampled communities
		are the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and households are the
		Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). Census data typically serve as
		the sample frame from which PSUs are selected. However, if
		census data are outdated inaccurate, or too geographically
		course, gridded population data (such as
		http://www.worldpop.org.uk) can be used as a sample frame
		instead. GridSample generates PSUs from gridded population data
		according to user-specified complex survey design
		characteristics and household sample size. In gridded
		population sampling, like census sampling, PSUs are selected
		within each stratum using a serpentine sampling method, and can
		be oversampled in urban or rural areas to ensure a minimum
		sample size in each of these important sub-domains.
		Furthermore, because grid cells are uniform in size and shape,
		gridded population sampling allows for samples to be
		representative of both the population and of space, which is
		not possible with a census sample frame.
