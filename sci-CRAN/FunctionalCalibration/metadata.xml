		Aggregated Functional Data Calibration using Splines and Wavelets
		// Implements methods for calibrating an aggregated functional
		data model using wavelets or splines. Each aggregated curve is
		modeled as a linear combination of component functions and
		known weights. The component functions are estimated using
		wavelets or splines. The package is based on dos Santos Sousa
		(2024) doi:10.1515/mcma-2023-2016 and Saraiva and Dias (2009)
