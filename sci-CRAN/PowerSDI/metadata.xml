		Calculate Standardised Drought Indices Using NASA POWER Data // A
		set of functions designed to calculate the standardised
		precipitation and standardised precipitation evapotranspiration
		indices using NASA POWER data as described in Blain et al.
		(2023) doi:10.2139/ssrn.4442843.  These indices are calculated
		using a reference data source.  The functions verify if the
		indices' estimates meet the assumption of normality and how
		well NASA POWER estimates represent real-world data.  Indices
		are calculated in a routine mode.  Potential evapotranspiration
		amounts and the difference between rainfall and potential
		evapotranspiration are also calculated.  The functions adopt a
		basic time scale that splits each month into four periods.
		Days 1 to 7, days 8 to 14, days 15 to 21, and days 22 to 28,
		29, 30, or 31, where 'TS=4' corresponds to a 1-month length
		moving window (calculated 4 times per month) and 'TS=48'
		corresponds to a 12-month length moving window (calculated 4
		times per month).
