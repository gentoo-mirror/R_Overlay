		Scalable Gaussian-Process Approximations // Fast scalable
		Gaussian process approximations, particularly well suited to
		spatial (aerial, remote-sensed) and environmental data,
		described in more detail in Katzfuss and Guinness (2017)
		arXiv:1708.06302. Package also contains a fast implementation
		of the incomplete Cholesky decomposition (IC0), based on
		Schaefer et al. (2019) arXiv:1706.02205 and MaxMin ordering
		proposed in Guinness (2018) arXiv:1609.05372.
