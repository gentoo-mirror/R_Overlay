		Linear Mediation Analysis for Complex Surveys Using Balanced
		Repeated Replication // It is a computer tool to conduct linear
		mediation analysis for complex surveys using multi-stage
		sampling and Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR). Specifically,
		the mediation analysis method using balanced repeated
		replications was proposed by Mai, Ha, and Soulakova (2019)
		DOI:10.1080/10705511.2018.1559065. The current version can only
		handle continuous mediators and outcomes. The development of
		'MedSurvey' was sponsored by American Lebanese Syrian
		Associated Charities (ALSAC). However, the contents of
		MedSurvey do not necessarily represent the policy of the ALSAC.
