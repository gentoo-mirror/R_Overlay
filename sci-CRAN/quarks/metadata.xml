		Simple Methods for Calculating Value at Risk and Expected
		Shortfall // Enables the user to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
		and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of various types of
		historical simulation. Currently plain historical simulation as
		well as age- and volatility-weighted historical simulation are
		implemented in this package. Volatility weighting is carried
		out via an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA).  The
		methods of the package are described in Gurrola-Perez, P. and
		Murphy, D. (2015)
