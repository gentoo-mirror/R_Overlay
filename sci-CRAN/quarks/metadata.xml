		Simple Methods for Calculating Value at Risk and Expected
		Shortfall // Enables the user to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
		and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of various types of
		historical simulation. Currently plain-, age-, volatility-
		weighted- and filtered historical simulation are implemented in
		this package. Volatility weighting can be carried out via an
		exponentially weighted moving average model (EWMA) or other
		GARCH-type models. The methods of the package are described in
		Gurrola-Perez, P. and Murphy, D. (2015)
