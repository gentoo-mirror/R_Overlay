		Simple Methods for Calculating and Backtesting Value at Risk and
		Expected Shortfall // Enables the user to calculate Value at
		Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of various
		types of historical simulation. Currently plain-, age-,
		volatility-weighted- and filtered historical simulation are
		implemented in this package. Volatility weighting can be
		carried out via an exponentially weighted moving average model
		(EWMA) or other GARCH-type models. The performance can be
		assessed via Traffic Light Test, Coverage Tests and Loss
		Functions. The methods of the package are described in Gurrola-
		Perez, P. and Murphy, D. (2015)
		https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:boe:boeewp:0525 as well as
		McNeil, J., Frey, R., and Embrechts, P. (2015)
