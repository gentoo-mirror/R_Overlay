		Advanced Response Surface Analysis // Provides tools for response
		surface analysis, using a comparative framework that identifies
		best-fitting solutions across 37 families of polynomials. Many
		of these tools are based upon and extend the 'RSA' package, by
		testing a larger scope of polynomials (+27 families), more
		diverse response surface probing techniques (+acceleration
		points), more plots (+line of congruence, +line of
		incongruence, both with extrema), and other useful functions
		for exporting results.
