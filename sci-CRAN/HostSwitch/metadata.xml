		Simulate the Extent of Host Switching by Consumers // Using a
		simulation-based approach, the 'HostSwitch' package provides
		functions to investigate host switches by consumers. The
		individual-based model is based on the concept of ecological
		fitting. The mockup model is published by Araujo et al. 2015.
		Understanding Host-Switching by Ecological Fitting
		(doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139225). The package provides an
		R-friendly and modified version of this model which can be
		applied to different consumer-resource scenarios.
