		Clustering for Multivariate and Univariate Data Using Expectation
		Maximization Algorithm // Implements the Improved Expectation
		Maximisation EM* and the traditional EM algorithm for
		clustering finite gaussian mixture models for both multivariate
		and univariate datasets. The initialization is done by randomly
		selecting the samples from the dataset as the mean (meu) of the
		Gaussian(s). This version implements the faster alternative EM*
		that avoids revisiting data by leveraging the heap structure.
		The algorithm returns a set of Gaussian parameters-posterior
		probabilities, mean (meu), co-variance matrices (multivariate
		)/standard-deviation (univariate) and priors. Reference: Hasan
