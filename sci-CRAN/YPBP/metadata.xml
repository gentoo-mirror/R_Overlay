		Yang and Prentice Model with Baseline Distribution Modeled by
		Bernstein Polynomials // Semiparametric modeling of lifetime
		data with crossing survival curves via Yang and Prentice model
		with baseline hazard/odds modeled with Bernstein polynomials.
		Details about the model can be found in Demarqui et al. (2019)
		arXiv:1910.04475. Model fitting can be carried out via both
		maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. The package also
		provides point and interval estimation for the crossing
		survival times.
