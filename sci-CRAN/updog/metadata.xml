		Flexible Genotyping for Polyploids // Implements empirical Bayes
		approaches to genotype polyploids from next generation
		sequencing data while accounting for allelic bias,
		overdispersion, and sequencing error. The main function is
		flexdog(), which allows the specification of many different
		genotype distributions. An experimental function that takes
		into account varying levels of relatedness is implemented in
		mupdog(). Also provided are functions to simulate genotypes,
		rgeno(), and read-counts, rflexdog(), as well as functions to
		calculate oracle genotyping error rates, oracle_mis(), and
		correlation with the true genotypes, oracle_cor(). These latter
		two functions are useful for read depth calculations. Run
		browseVignettes(package = "updog") in R for example usage. See
		Gerard et al. (2018) doi:10.1534/genetics.118.301468 and Gerard
		and Ferrao (2019) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz852 for details
		on the implemented methods.
