		Normalized Spatial Intensity Correlation // Calculate the
		colocalization index, NSInC, in two different ways as described
		in the paper (Liu et al., 2019. Manuscript submitted for
		publication.) for multiple-species spatial data which contain
		the precise locations and membership of each spatial point. The
		two main functions are nsinc.d() and nsinc.z(). They provide
		the Pearsons correlation coefficients of signal proportions in
		different memberships within a concerned proximity of every
		signal (or every base signal if single direction colocalization
		is considered) across all (base) signals using two different
		ways of normalization. The proximity sizes could be an
		individual value or a range of values, where the default ranges
		of values are different for the two functions.
