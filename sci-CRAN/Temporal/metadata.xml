		Parametric Time to Event Analysis // Performs likelihood-based
		estimation and inference on time to event data, possibly
		subject to non-informative right censoring. fitParaSurv()
		provides maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and
		distributional characteristics. compParaSurv() compares the
		mean and median survival experiences of two treatment arms.
		Candidate distributions currently include the exponential,
		gamma, generalized gamma, log-logistic, log-normal, and
		Weibull.
