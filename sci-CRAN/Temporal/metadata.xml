		Parametric Time to Event Analysis // Performs maximum likelihood
		based estimation and inference on time to event data, possibly
		subject to non-informative right censoring. fitParaSurv()
		provides maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and
		distributional characteristics, including the mean, median,
		variance, and restricted mean. compParaSurv() compares the
		mean, median, and restricted mean survival experiences of two
		treatment groups. Candidate distributions include the
		exponential, gamma, generalized gamma, log-normal, and Weibull.
