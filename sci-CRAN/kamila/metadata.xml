		Methods for Clustering Mixed-Type Data // Implements methods for
		clustering mixed-type data, specifically combinations of
		continuous and nominal data. Special attention is paid to the
		often-overlooked problem of equitably balancing the
		contribution of the continuous and categorical variables. This
		package implements KAMILA clustering, a novel method for
		clustering mixed-type data in the spirit of k-means clustering.
		It does not require dummy coding of variables, and is efficient
		enough to scale to rather large data sets. Also implemented is
		Modha-Spangler clustering, which uses a brute-force strategy to
		maximize the cluster separation simultaneously in the
		continuous and categorical variables. For more information, see
