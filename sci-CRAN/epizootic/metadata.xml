		Spatially Explicit Population Models of Disease Transmission in
		Wildlife // This extension of the pattern-oriented modeling
		framework of the 'poems' package provides a collection of
		modules and functions customized for modeling disease
		transmission on a population scale in a spatiotemporally
		explicit manner. This includes seasonal time steps, dispersal
		functions that track disease state of dispersers, results
		objects that store disease states, and a population simulator
		that includes disease dynamics.
