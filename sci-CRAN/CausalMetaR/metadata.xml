		Causally Interpretable Meta-Analysis // Provides robust and
		efficient methods for estimating causal effects in a target
		population using a multi-source dataset, including those of
		Dahabreh et al. (2019) doi:10.1111/biom.13716 and Robertson et
		al. (2021) arXiv:2104.05905. The multi-source data can be a
		collection of trials, observational studies, or a combination
		of both, which have the same data structure (outcome,
		treatment, and covariates). The target population can be based
		on an internal dataset or an external dataset where only
		covariate information is available. The causal estimands
		available are average treatment effects and subgroup treatment
		effects.
