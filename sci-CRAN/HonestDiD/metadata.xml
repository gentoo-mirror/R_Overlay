		Robust Inference in Difference-in-Differences and Event Study
		Designs // Provides functions to conduct robust inference in
		difference-in-differences and event study designs by
		implementing the methods developed in Rambachan  Roth (2023)
		doi:10.1093/restud/rdad018, "A More Credible Approach to
		Parallel Trends" [Previously titled "An Honest Approach..."].
		Inference is conducted under a weaker version of the parallel
		trends assumption. Uniformly valid confidence sets are
		constructed based upon conditional confidence sets, fixed-
		length confidence sets and hybridized confidence sets.
