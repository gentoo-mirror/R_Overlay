		Threshold and AUC Estimation with Right-Censored Data at a Fixed
		Time t // We focus on the estimation of optimal thresholds and
		AUCs when the outcome of interest is the status (alive or dead)
		of the subjects at a certain time-point t. This binary status
		is determined by right-censored times to event and it is
		missing for those subjects censored before t. Here we provide
		three methods (missing exclusion, imputation of censored times
		and using time-dependent ROC curves) to estimate optimal
		thresholds and AUCs in this context. Two references for the
		methods used here are Skaltsa et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1002/bimj.200900294 and Heagerty et al. (2000)
		doi:10.1111/j.0006-341x.2000.00337.x.
