		Diagnostic Ability Assessment with Right-Censored Data at a Fixed
		Time t // We focus on the diagnostic ability assessment of
		medical tests when the outcome of interest is the status (alive
		or dead) of the subjects at a certain time-point t. This binary
		status is determined by right-censored times to event and it is
		unknown for those subjects censored before t. Here we provide
		three methods (unknown status exclusion, imputation of censored
		times and using time-dependent ROC curves) to evaluate the
		diagnostic ability of binary and continuous tests in this
		context. Two references for the methods used here are Skaltsa
		et al. (2010) doi:10.1002/bimj.200900294 and Heagerty et al.
		(2000) doi:10.1111/j.0006-341x.2000.00337.x.
