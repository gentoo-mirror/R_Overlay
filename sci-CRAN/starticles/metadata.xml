		A Generic, Publisher-Independent Template for Writing Scientific
		Documents in 'rmarkdown' // Provides a generic, publisher-
		independent Rmarkdown template for writing scientific papers
		and reports in Rmarkdown. The template allows for all the basic
		features of a scientific article, including a title page with
		author affiliations and footnotes possibly shown in two common
		formats, multi-language abstracts and keywords, page headers
		and footers, and the ability to place figures and tables at the
		end of the output PDF. Smart cross-referencing of figures,
		tables, equations and sections is provided using the bookdown
		package. See package README.md for basic package usage.
