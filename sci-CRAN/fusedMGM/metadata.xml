		Implementation of Fused MGM to Infer 2-Class Networks //
		Implementation of fused Markov graphical model (FMGM; Park and
		Won, 2022). The functions include building mixed graphical
		model (MGM) objects from data, inference of networks using
		FMGM, stable edge-specific penalty selection (StEPS) for the
		determination of penalization parameters, and the
