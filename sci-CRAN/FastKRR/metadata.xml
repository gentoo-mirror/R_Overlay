		Kernel Ridge Regression using 'RcppArmadillo' // Provides core
		computational operations in C++ via 'RcppArmadillo', enabling
		faster performance than pure R, improved numerical stability,
		and parallel execution with OpenMP where available. On systems
		without OpenMP support, the package automatically falls back to
		single-threaded execution with no user configuration required.
		For efficient model selection, it integrates with 'CVST' to
		provide sequential-testing cross-validation that identifies
		competitive hyperparameters without exhaustive grid search. The
		package offers a unified interface for exact kernel ridge
		regression and three scalable approximationsNystrm, Pivoted
		Cholesky, and Random Fourier Featuresallowing analyses with
		substantially larger sample sizes than are feasible with exact
		KRR. It also integrates with the 'tidymodels' ecosystem via the
		'parsnip' model specification 'krr_reg', and the S3 method
		tunable.krr_reg(). To understand the theoretical background,
		one can refer to Wainwright (2019) doi:10.1017/9781108627771.
