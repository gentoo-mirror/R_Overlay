		Preparing Data For, and Calculating the Prediction Test // Global
		hypothesis tests combine information across multiple endpoints
		to test a single hypothesis. The prediction test is a recently
		proposed global hypothesis test with good performance for small
		sample sizes and many endpoints of interest. The test is also
		flexible in the types and combinations of expected results
		across the individual endpoints. This package provides
		functions for data processing and calculation of the prediction
		test.
