		R Commander Plug-in for the EZR (Easy R) Package // EZR (Easy R)
		adds a variety of statistical functions, including survival
		analyses, ROC analyses, metaanalyses, sample size calculation,
		and so on, to the R commander. EZR enables point-and-click easy
		access to statistical functions, especially for medical
		statistics. EZR is platform-independent and runs on Windows,
		Mac OS X, and UNIX. Its complete manual is available only in
		Japanese (Chugai Igakusha, ISBN: 978-4-498-10901-8 or Nankodo,
		ISBN: 978-4-524-26158-1), but an report that introduced the
		investigation of EZR was published in Bone Marrow
		Transplantation (Nature Publishing Group) as an Open article.
		This report can be used as a simple manual. It can be freely
		downloaded from the journal website as shown below. This report
		has been cited in more than 1,000 scientific articles.
