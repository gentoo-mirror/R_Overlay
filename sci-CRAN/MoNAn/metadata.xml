		Mobility Network Analysis // Implements the method to analyse
		weighted mobility networks or distribution networks as outlined
		in: Block, P., Stadtfeld, C.,  Robins, G. (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2021.08.003. The purpose of the model is
		to analyse the structure of mobility, incorporating exogenous
		predictors pertaining to individuals and locations known from
		classical mobility analyses, as well as modelling emergent
		mobility patterns akin to structural patterns known from the
		statistical analysis of social networks.
