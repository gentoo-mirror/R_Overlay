		Database Storage of Genotype Probabilities for QTL Mapping //
		Uses the 'fst' package to store genotype probabilities on disk
		for the 'qtl2' package. These genotype probabilities are a
		central data object for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL),
		but they can be quite large. The facilities in this package
		enable the genotype probabilities to be stored on disk, leading
		to reduced memory usage with only a modest increase in
		computation time.
