		The Lorentz Transform in Relativistic Physics // Addition of
		velocities in special relativity is not straightforward: the
		parallelogram addition law does not apply because velocity
		addition is neither commutative nor associative.  This package
		furnishes functionality to work with Lorentz transforms and the
		gyrogroup structure of three-velocities.  For general
		relativity, see the 'schwarzschild' package.
