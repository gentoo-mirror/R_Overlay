		The Lorentz Transform in Relativistic Physics // The Lorentz
		transform in special relativity; also the gyrogroup structure
		of three-velocities.  Includes active and passive transforms
		and the ability to use units in which the speed of light is not
		one.  For general relativity, see the 'schwarzschild' package.
