		The Lorentz Transform in Relativistic Physics // The Lorentz
		transform in special relativity; also the gyrogroup structure
		of three-velocities.  Performs active and passive transforms
		and has the ability to use units in which the speed of light is
		not unity.  Includes some experimental functionality for
		celerity and rapidity.  For general relativity, see the
		'schwarzschild' package.
