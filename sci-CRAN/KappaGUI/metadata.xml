		An R-Shiny Application for Calculating Cohen's and Fleiss' Kappa
		// Offers a graphical user interface for the evaluation of
		inter-rater agreement with Cohen's and Fleiss' Kappa. The
		calculation of kappa statistics is done using the R package
		'irr', so that 'KappaGUI' is essentially a Shiny front-end for
		'irr'.
