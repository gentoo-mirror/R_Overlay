		Plots Sankey Diagrams // Sankey diagrams are a powerfull and
		visually attractive way to visualize the flow of conservative
		substances through a system. They typically consists of a
		network of nodes, and fluxes between them, where the total
		balance in each internal node is 0, i.e. input equals output.
		Sankey diagrams are typically used to display energy systems,
		material flow accounts etc. Unlike so-called alluvial plots,
		Sankey diagrams also allow for cyclic flows: flows originating
		from a single node can, either direct or indirect, contribute
		to the input of that same node. This package, named after the
		Greek aphorism Panta Rhei (everything flows), provides
		functions to create publication-quality diagrams, using data in
		tables (or spread sheets) and a simple syntax.
