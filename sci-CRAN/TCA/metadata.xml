		Tensor Composition Analysis // Tensor Composition Analysis (TCA)
		allows the deconvolution of two-dimensional data (features by
		observations) coming from a mixture of heterogeneous sources
		into a three-dimensional matrix of signals (features by
		observations by sources). The TCA framework further allows to
		test the features in the data for different statistical
		relations with an outcome of interest while modeling source-
		specific effects; particularly, it allows to look for
		statistical relations between source-specific signals and an
		outcome. For example, TCA can deconvolve bulk tissue-level DNA
		methylation data (methylation sites by individuals) into a
		three-dimensional tensor of cell-type-specific methylation
		levels for each individual (i.e. methylation sites by
		individuals by cell types) and it allows to detect cell-type-
		specific statistical relations (associations) with phenotypes.
