		Tensor Composition Analysis // Tensor Composition Analysis (TCA)
		allows the deconvolution of two-dimensional data (features by
		observations) coming from a mixture of sources into a three-
		dimensional matrix of signals (features by observations by
		sources). TCA further allows to test the features in the data
		for different statistical relations with an outcome of interest
		while modeling source-specific effects (TCA regression);
		particularly, it allows to look for statistical relations
		between source-specific signals and an outcome. For example,
		TCA can deconvolve bulk tissue-level DNA methylation data
		(methylation sites by individuals) into a tensor of cell-type-
		specific methylation levels for each individual (methylation
		sites by individuals by cell types) and it allows to detect
		cell-type-specific relations (associations) with an outcome of
		interest. For more details see Rahmani et al. (2018)
