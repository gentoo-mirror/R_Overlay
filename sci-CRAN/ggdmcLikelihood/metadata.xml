		Likelihood Computation for 'ggdmc' Package // Efficient
		computation of likelihoods in design-based choice response time
		models, including the Decision Diffusion Model, is supported.
		The package enables rapid evaluation of likelihood functions
		for both single- and multi-subject models across trial-level
		data. It also offers fast initialisation of starting parameters
		for genetic sampling with many Markov chains, facilitating
		estimation in complex models typically found in experimental
		psychology and behavioural science. These optimisations help
		reduce computational overhead in large-scale model fitting
		tasks.
