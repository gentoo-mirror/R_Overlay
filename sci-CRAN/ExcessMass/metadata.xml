		Excess Mass Calculation and Plots // Implementation of a function
		which calculates the empirical excess mass for given
		\eqn{\lambda} and given maximal number of modes (excessm()).
		Offering powerful plot features to visualize empirical excess
		mass (exmplot()). This includes the possibility of drawing
		several plots (with different maximal number of modes / cut off
		values) in a single graph.
