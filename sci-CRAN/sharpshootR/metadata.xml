		A Soil Survey Toolkit // A collection of data processing,
		visualization, and export functions to support soil survey
		operations. Many of the functions build on the
		`SoilProfileCollection` S4 class provided by the aqp package,
		extending baseline visualization to more elaborate depictions
		in the context of spatial and taxonomic data. While this
		package is primarily developed by and for the USDA-NRCS, in
		support of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, the authors
		strive for generalization sufficient to support any soil survey
		operation. Many of the included functions are used by the
		SoilWeb suite of websites and movile applications. These
		functions are provided here, with additional documentation, to
		enable others to replicate high quality versions of these
		figures for their own purposes.
