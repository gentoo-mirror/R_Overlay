		'SQL' Case Statement Generator // Includes built-in methods for
		generating long 'SQL' CASE statements, and other 'SQL'
		statements that may otherwise be arduous to construct by hand.
		The generated statement can easily be concatenated to string
		literals to form queries to 'SQL'-like databases, such as when
		using the 'RODBC' package. The current methods include
		casewhen() for building CASE statements, inlist() for building
		IN statements, and updatetable() for building UPDATE
		statements.
