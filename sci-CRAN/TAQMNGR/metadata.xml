		Manage Tick-by-Tick Transaction Data // Manager of tick-by-tick
		transaction data that performs 'cleaning', 'aggregation' and
		'import' in an efficient and fast way. The package engine,
		written in C++, exploits the 'zlib' and 'gzstream' libraries to
		handle gzipped data without need to uncompress them. 'Cleaning'
		and 'aggregation' are performed according to Brownlees and
		Gallo (2006) DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2006.09.030. Currently, TAQMNGR
		processes raw data from WRDS (Wharton Research Data Service,
		https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/).
