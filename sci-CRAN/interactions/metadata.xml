		Comprehensive, User-Friendly Toolkit for Probing Interactions //
		A suite of functions for conducting and interpreting analysis
		of statistical interaction in regression models that was
		formerly part of the 'jtools' package. Functionality includes
		visualization of two- and three-way interactions among
		continuous and/or categorical variables as well as calculation
		of "simple slopes" and Johnson-Neyman intervals. These
		capabilities are implemented for generalized linear models in
		addition to the standard linear regression context.
