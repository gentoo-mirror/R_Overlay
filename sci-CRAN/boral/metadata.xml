		Bayesian Ordination and Regression AnaLysis // Bayesian
		approaches for analyzing multivariate data in ecology.
		Estimation is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		methods via Three. JAGS types of models may be fitted: 1) With
		explanatory variables only, boral fits independent column
		Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to each column of the response
		matrix; 2) With latent variables only, boral fits a purely
		latent variable model for model-based unconstrained ordination;
		3) With explanatory and latent variables, boral fits correlated
		column GLMs with latent variables to account for any residual
		correlation between the columns of the response matrix.
