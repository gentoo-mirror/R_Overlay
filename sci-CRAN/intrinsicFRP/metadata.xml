		Adaptive Estimation of Intrinsic Factor Risk Premia // Efficient
		computation of intrinsic and adaptive intrinsic factor risk
		premia and their standard errors. Intrinsic factor risk premia
		are defined as the negative factor covariance with the SDF
		projection on test asset returns. As opposed to benchmark
		notions of factor risk premia, they are well-defined even in
		presence of useless and weak factors, they do not depend on the
		degree of misspecification of the factor model, and are one-to-
		one linked to two-pass mimicking factor risk premia
		coefficients, whenever the latter are also well-defined.
