		Oracle Estimation and Inference for Tradable Factor Risk Premia
		// Tradable factor risk premia are given by the negative factor
		covariance with the Stochastic Discount Factor projection on
		returns. This package provides efficient computation of
		tradable and Oracle tradable factor risk premia estimators and
		their standard errors; see A. Quaini, F. Trojani and M. Yuan
		(2023)
		https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4574683.
		Tradable factor risk premia are robust to misspecification or
		weak identification in asset pricing models, and they are zero
		for any factor weakly correlated with returns. Their Oracle
		estimator performs as well as if the weak or useless factors
		were known in advance. This means it not only consistently
		removes useless factors and factors weakly correlated with
		returns but also gives rise to reliable tests of asset pricing
		models.
