		Exact Bayesian Model Selection Methods for the Sparse Normal
		Sequence Model // Contains fast functions to calculate the
		exact Bayes posterior for the Sparse Normal Sequence Model,
		implementing the algorithms described in Van Erven and Szabo
		(2021, doi:10.1214/20-BA1227). For general hierarchical priors,
		sample sizes up to 10,000 are feasible within half an hour on a
		standard laptop. For beta-binomial spike-and-slab priors, a
		faster algorithm is provided, which can handle sample sizes of
		100,000 in half an hour. In the implementation, special care
		has been taken to assure numerical stability of the methods
		even for such large sample sizes.
