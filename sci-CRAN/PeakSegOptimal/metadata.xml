		Optimal Segmentation Subject to Up-Down Constraints // Computes
		optimal changepoint models using the Poisson likelihood for
		non-negative count data, subject to the PeakSeg constraint: the
		first change must be up, second change down, third change up,
		etc. For more info about the models and algorithms, read
		"Constrained Dynamic Programming and Supervised Penalty
		Learning Algorithms for Peak Detection"
