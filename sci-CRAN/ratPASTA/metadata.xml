		Processing Acoustic Startle Experimental Data // Used for
		processing data obtained from behaviour experiments studying
		acoustic startle response, a reflex to a loud sound, modulated
		by several brain regions. The input data is generated with
		PASTA (Platform for Acoustic STArtle), a DIY device made from a
		kitchen scale that measures the twitch of an animal standing on
		the device and records it as time-series data. The function of
		this package is to import all data, process it in accordance
		with default or custom metadata describing the experiment
		protocol, calculate measurements and visualize the results. The
		PASTA solution and this package are described in Virag et al.
