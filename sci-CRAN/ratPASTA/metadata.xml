		Processing Acoustic Startle Experimental Data // Used for
		processing data obtained from behaviour experiments studying
		acoustic startle response and grip strength in rodents. The
		input data is generated with PASTA (Platform for Acoustic
		STArtle), a DIY device made from a kitchen scale. The function
		of this package is to import all data, process it in accordance
		with default or custom metadata describing the experiment
		protocol, calculate measurements and visualize the results. The
		PASTA platform is described in Virag et al. (2020)
