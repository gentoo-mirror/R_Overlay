		Confidence Intervals and Tests for Comparisons of Binomial
		Proportions or Poisson Rates // Computes confidence intervals
		for binomial or Poisson rates and their differences or ratios.
		Including the rate (or risk) difference ('RD') or rate ratio
		(or relative risk, 'RR') for binomial proportions or Poisson
		rates, and odds ratio ('OR', binomial only). Also confidence
		intervals for RD, RR or OR for paired binomial data, and
		estimation of a proportion from clustered binomial data.
		Includes skewness-corrected asymptotic score ('SCAS') methods,
		which have been developed in Laud (2017) doi:10.1002/pst.1813
		from Miettinen and Nurminen (1985) doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211
		and Gart and Nam (1988) doi:10.2307/2531848, and in Laud (2025,
		under review) for paired proportions. The same score produces
		hypothesis tests that are improved versions of the non-
		inferiority test for binomial RD and RR by Farrington and
		Manning (1990) doi:10.1002/sim.4780091208, or a generalisation
		of the McNemar test for paired data. The package also includes
		MOVER methods (Method Of Variance Estimates Recovery) for all
		contrasts, derived from the Newcombe method but with options to
		use equal-tailed intervals in place of the Wilson score method,
		and generalised for Bayesian applications incorporating prior
		information. So-called 'exact' methods for strictly
		conservative coverage are approximated using continuity
		adjustments, and the amount of adjustment can be selected to
		avoid over-conservative coverage.  Also includes methods for
		stratified calculations (e.g. meta-analysis), either with fixed
		effect assumption (matching the CMH test) or incorporating
		stratum heterogeneity.
