		Confidence Intervals for Comparisons of Binomial or Poisson Rates
		// Computes confidence intervals for the rate (or risk)
		difference ("RD") or rate ratio (or relative risk, "RR") for
		binomial proportions or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio ("OR",
		binomial only). Also confidence intervals for a single binomial
		or Poisson rate, and intervals for matched pairs. Includes
		asymptotic score methods including skewness corrections, which
		have been developed in Laud (2017, in press) from Miettinen
		Nurminen (1985) doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211 and Gart  Nam (1988)
		doi:10.2307/2531848. Also includes MOVER methods (Method Of
		Variance Estimates Recovery), derived from the Newcombe method
		but using equal-tailed Jeffreys intervals, and generalised for
		incorporating prior information. Also methods for stratified
		calculations (e.g. meta-analysis), either assuming fixed
		effects or incorporating stratum heterogeneity.
