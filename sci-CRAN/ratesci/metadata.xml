		Confidence Intervals for Comparisons of Binomial or Poisson Rates
		// Computes confidence intervals for the rate (or risk)
		difference ('RD') or rate ratio (or relative risk, 'RR') for
		binomial proportions or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio ('OR',
		binomial only). Also confidence intervals for a single binomial
		or Poisson rate, and intervals for matched pairs. Includes
		skewness-corrected asymptotic score ('SCAS') methods, which
		have been developed in Laud (2017) doi:10.1002/pst.1813 from
		Miettinen  Nurminen (1985) doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211 and Gart
		Nam (1988) doi:10.2307/2531848. The same score produces
		hypothesis tests analogous to the test for binomial RD and RR
		by Farrington  Manning (1990) doi:10.1002/sim.4780091208, or
		the McNemar test for paired data. The package also includes
		MOVER methods (Method Of Variance Estimates Recovery) for all
		contrasts, derived from the Newcombe method but with options to
		use equal-tailed intervals in place of the Wilson score method,
		and generalised for Bayesian applications incorporating prior
		information. So-called 'exact' methods for strictly
		conservative coverage are approximated using continuity
		corrections, and the amount of correction can be selected to
		avoid over-conservative coverage. Also includes methods for
		stratified calculations (e.g. meta-analysis), either assuming
		fixed effects (matching the CMH test) or incorporating stratum
		heterogeneity.
