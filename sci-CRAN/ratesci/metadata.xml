		Confidence Intervals for Comparisons of Binomial or Poisson Rates
		// Computes confidence intervals for the rate (or risk)
		difference ('RD') or rate ratio (or relative risk, 'RR') for
		binomial proportions or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio ('OR',
		binomial only). Also confidence intervals for a single binomial
		or Poisson rate, and intervals for matched pairs. Includes
		skewness-corrected asymptotic score ('SCAS') methods, which
		have been developed in Laud (2017) doi:10.1002/pst.1813 from
		Miettinen  Nurminen (1985) doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211 and Gart
		Nam (1988) doi:10.2307/2531848. Also includes MOVER methods
		(Method Of Variance Estimates Recovery) for all contrasts,
		derived from the Newcombe method but using equal-tailed
		Jeffreys intervals, and generalised for Bayesian applications
		incorporating prior information. So-called 'exact' methods for
		strictly conservative coverage are approximated using
		continuity corrections. Also includes methods for stratified
		calculations (e.g. meta-analysis), either assuming fixed
		effects or incorporating stratum heterogeneity.
