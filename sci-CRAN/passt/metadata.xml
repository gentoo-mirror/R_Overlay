		Probability Associator Time (PASS-T) // Simulates judgments of
		frequency and duration based on the Probability Associator Time
		(PASS-T) model. PASS-T is a memory model based on a simple
		competitive artificial neural network. It can imitate human
		judgments of frequency and duration, which have been
		extensively studied in cognitive psychology (e.g. Hintzman
		(1970) doi:10.1037/h0028865, Betsch et al. (2010)
		https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-18204-003). The PASS-T
		model is an extension of the PASS model (Sedlmeier, 2002,
		ISBN:0198508638). The package provides an easy way to run
		simulations, which can then be compared with empirical data in
		human judgments of frequency and duration.
