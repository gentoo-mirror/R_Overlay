		Performs Bayesian Variable Selection on the Covariates in a Semi-
		Competing Risks Model // Uses Stochastic Search Variable
		Selection to select important covariates in the three hazard
		functions of a semi-competing risks model. This function
		performs the Gibbs sampler for variable selection and a
		Metropolis-Hastings-Green sampler for the number of split
		points and parameters for the three baseline hazard function.
		This function returns the posterior sample of all quantities
		sampled in the Gibbs sampler after a burn-in period to a
		desired file location.
