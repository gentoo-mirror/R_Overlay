		Improved Trimmed Weighted Hochberg Procedures and Sample Size
		Optimization // The improved trimmed weighted Hochberg
		procedure provides increased statistical power and relaxes the
		dependence assumptions for familywise error rate control
		compared to the original weighted Hochberg procedure. This
		package computes the boundaries required for implementing the
		proposed methodology and includes sample size optimization
		methods. See Gou, J., Chang, Y., Li, T., and Zhang, F.(2025).
		Improved trimmed weighted Hochberg procedures with two
		endpoints and sample size optimization. Technical Report.
