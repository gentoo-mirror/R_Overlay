		Portable Address Space Mapping // Portable '/proc/self/maps' as a
		data frame. Determine which library or other region is mapped
		to a specific address of a process. -- R packages can contain
		native code, compiled to shared libraries at build or
		installation time. When loaded, each shared library occupies a
		portion of the address space of the main process. When only a
		machine instruction pointer is available (e.g. from a backtrace
		during error inspection or profiling), the address space map
		determines which library this instruction pointer corresponds
		to.
