		Develop Clinical Prediction Models Using the Common Data Model //
		A user friendly way to create patient level prediction models
		using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common
		Data Model. Given a cohort of interest and an outcome of
		interest, the package can use data in the Common Data Model to
		build a large set of features. These features can then be used
		to fit a predictive model with a number of machine learning
		algorithms. This is further described in Reps (2017)
