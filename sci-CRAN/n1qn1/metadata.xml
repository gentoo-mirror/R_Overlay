		Port of the 'Scilab' 'n1qn1' Modules for Un-constrained BFGS
		Optimization // Provides 'Scilab' 'n1qn1', or Quasi-Newton BFGS
		"qn" without constraints and 'qnbd' or Quasi-Newton BFGS with
		constraints. This takes more memory than traditional L-BFGS.
		The n1qn1 routine is useful since it allows prespecification of
		a Hessian. If the Hessian is near enough the truth in
		optimization it can speed up the optimization problem. Both
		algorithms are described in the 'Scilab' optimization
		documentation located at https://www.scilab.org/sites/default/f
		iles/optimization_in_scilab.pdf.
