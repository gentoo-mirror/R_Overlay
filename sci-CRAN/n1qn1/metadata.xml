		Port of the 'Scilab' 'n1qn1' Module for Unconstrained BFGS
		Optimization // Provides 'Scilab' 'n1qn1'. This takes more
		memory than traditional L-BFGS.  The n1qn1 routine is useful
		since it allows prespecification of a Hessian. If the Hessian
		is near enough the truth in optimization it can speed up the
		optimization problem. The algorithm is described in the
		'Scilab' optimization documentation located at https://www.scil
		ab.org/sites/default/files/optimization_in_scilab.pdf. This
		version uses manually modified code from 'f2c' to make this a C
		only binary.
