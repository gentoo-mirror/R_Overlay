		Port of the 'Scilab' 'n1qn1' Module for Unconstrained BFGS
		Optimization // Provides 'Scilab' 'n1qn1', or Quasi-Newton BFGS
		"qn" without constraints.  This takes more memory than
		traditional L-BFGS.  This routine is useful since it allows
		prespecification of a Hessian.  If the Hessian is near enough
		the truth in optimization it can speed up the optimization
		problem. The algorithm is described in the 'Scilab'
		optimization documentation located at http://www.scilab.org/con
		tent/download/250/1714/file/optimization_in_scilab.pdf.
