		D-Score for Child Development // The D-score summarizes the
		child's performance on a set of milestones into a single
		number. The package implements four Rasch model keys to convert
		milestone scores into a D-score. It provides tools to calculate
		the D-score and its precision from the child's milestone
		scores, to convert the D-score into the Development-for-Age
		Z-score (DAZ) using age-conditional references, and to map
		milestone names into a generic 9-position item naming
		convention.
