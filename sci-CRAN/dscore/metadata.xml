		D-Score for Child Development // The D-score summarizes a child's
		performance on developmental milestones into a single number.
		Its key feature is its generic nature. The method does not
		depend on a specific measurement instrument. The statistical
		method underlying the D-score is described in van Buuren et al.
		(2025) doi:10.1177/01650254241294033. This package implements
		model keys to convert milestone scores to D-scores; maps
		instrument-specific item names to a generic 9-position naming
		convention; computes D-scores and their precision from a
		child's milestone scores; and converts D-scores to Development-
		for-Age Z-scores (DAZ) using age-conditional reference
		standards.
