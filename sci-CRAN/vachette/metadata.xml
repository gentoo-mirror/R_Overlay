		A Method for Visualization of Pharmacometric Models // A method
		to visualize pharmacometric analyses which are impacted by
		covariate effects. Variability-aligned covariate harmonized-
		effects and time-transformation equivalent ('vachette')
		facilitates intuitive overlays of data and model predictions,
		allowing for comprehensive comparison without dilution effects.
		'vachette' improves upon previous methods Lommerse et al.
		(2021) doi:10.1002/psp4.12679, enabling its application to all
		pharmacometric models and enhancing Visual Predictive Checks
		(VPC) by integrating data into cohesive plots that can
		highlight model misspecification.
