		Helper Functions for Structural Equation Modeling // An
		assortment of helper functions for doing structural equation
		modeling, mainly by 'lavaan' for now. Most of them are time-
		saving functions for common tasks in doing structural equation
		modeling and reading the output. This package is not for
		functions that implement advanced statistical procedures. It is
		a light-weight package for simple functions that do simple
		tasks conveniently, with as few dependencies as possible.
