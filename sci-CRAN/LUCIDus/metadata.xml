		LUCID with Multiple Omics Data // An implementation of estimating
		the Latent Unknown Clusters By Integrating Multi-omics Data
		(LUCID) model (Peng (2019) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz667).
		LUCID conducts integrated clustering using exposures, omics
		information (and outcome information as an option). This
		package implements three different integration strategies for
		multi-omics data analysis within the LUCID framework: LUCID
		early integration (the original LUCID model), LUCID in parallel
		(intermediate integration), and LUCID in serial (late
		integration). Automated model selection for each LUCID model is
		available to obtain the optimal number of latent clusters, and
		an integrated imputation approach is implemented to handle
		sporadic and list-wise missingness in multi-omics data. Lasso-
		type regularity for exposure and omics features were added. S3
		methods for summary and plotting functions were fixed.
