		LUCID with Multiple Omics Data // An implementation of estimating
		the Latent Unknown Clusters By Integrating Multi-omics Data
		(LUCID) model (Peng (2019) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz667).
		LUCID conducts integrated clustering using exposures, omics
		data (and outcome as an option). This is a major update from
		the last version while conserving all the previous features.
		This package implements three different integration strategies
		for multiple omics data analysis within the LUCID framework:
		LUCID early integration (the original LUCID model), LUCID in
		parallel (intermediate), and LUCID in serial (late). Automated
		model selection for each LUCID model is available to obtain the
		optimal number of latent clusters, and an integrated imputation
		approach is implemented to handle sporadic and list-wise
		missing multiple omics data.
