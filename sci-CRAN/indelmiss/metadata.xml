		Insertion Deletion Analysis While Accounting for Possible Missing
		Data // Genome-wide gene insertion and deletion rates can be
		modelled in a maximum likelihood framework with the additional
		flexibility of modelling potential missing data using the
		models included within. These models simultaneously estimate
		insertion and deletion (indel) rates of gene families and
		proportions of "missing" data for (multiple) taxa of interest.
		The likelihood framework is utilized for parameter estimation.
		A phylogenetic tree of the taxa and gene presence/absence
		patterns (with data ordered by the tips of the tree) are
		required. See Dang et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1534/genetics.116.191973 for more details.
