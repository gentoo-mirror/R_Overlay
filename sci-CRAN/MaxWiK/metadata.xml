		Machine Learning Method Based on Isolation Kernel Mean Embedding
		// Incorporates Approximate Bayesian Computation to get a
		posterior distribution and to select a model optimal parameter
		for an observation point. Additionally, the meta-sampling
		heuristic algorithm is realized for parameter estimation, which
		requires no model runs and is dimension-independent. A sampling
		scheme is also presented that allows model runs and uses the
		meta-sampling for point generation. A predictor is realized as
		the meta-sampling for the model output. All the algorithms
		leverage a machine learning method utilizing the maxima
		weighted Isolation Kernel approach, or 'MaxWiK'. The method
		involves transforming raw data to a Hilbert space (mapping) and
		measuring the similarity between simulated points and the
		maxima weighted Isolation Kernel mapping corresponding to the
		observation point. Comprehensive details of the methodology can
		be found in the papers Iurii Nagornov (2024)
