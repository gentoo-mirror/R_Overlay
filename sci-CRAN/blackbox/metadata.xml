		Black Box Optimization and Exploration of Parameter Space //
		Performs prediction of a response function from simulated
		response values, allowing black-box optimization of functions
		estimated with some error. Includes a simple user interface for
		such applications, as well as more specialized functions
		designed to be called by the Migraine software (Rousset and
		Leblois, 2012 doi:10.1093/molbev/MSR262; Leblois et al., 2014
		doi:10.1093/molbev/msu212; and see URL). The latter functions
		are used for prediction of likelihood surfaces and implied
		likelihood ratio confidence intervals, and for exploration of
		predictor space of the surface. Prediction of the response is
		based on ordinary Kriging (with residual error) of the input.
		Estimation of smoothing parameters is performed by generalized
		cross-validation.
