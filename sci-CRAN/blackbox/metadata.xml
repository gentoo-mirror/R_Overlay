		Black Box Optimization and Exploration of Parameter Space //
		Performs prediction of a response function from simulated
		response values, allowing black-box optimization of functions
		estimated with some error. blackbox includes a simple user
		interface for such applications, as well as more specialized
		functions designed to be called by the Migraine software (see
		URL). The latter functions are used for prediction of
		likelihood surfaces and implied likelihood ratio confidence
		intervals, and for exploration of predictor space of the
		surface. Prediction of the response is based on ordinary
		kriging (with residual error) of the input. Estimation of
		smoothing parameters is performed by generalized cross
		validation.
