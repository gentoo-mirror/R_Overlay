		Character String Processing Facilities // Allows for fast,
		correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient character
		string/text processing in every locale and any native encoding.
		Owing to the use of the ICU library, the package provides R
		users with platform-independent functions known to Java, Perl,
		Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers. Available features include:
		pattern searching (e.g., with ICU Java-like regular expressions
		or the Unicode Collation Algorithm), random string generation,
		case mapping, string transliteration, concatenation, Unicode
		normalization, date-time formatting and parsing, etc.
