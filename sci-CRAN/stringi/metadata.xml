		Character String Processing Facilities // Allows for fast,
		correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient character
		string/text processing in every locale and any native encoding.
		Owing to the use of the ICU library, the package provides R
		users with platform-independent functions known to Java, Perl,
		Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers. Among available features
		there are: pattern searching (e.g., with ICU Java-like regular
		expressions or the Unicode Collation Algorithm), random string
		generation, case mapping, string transliteration,
		concatenation, Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and
		parsing, etc.
