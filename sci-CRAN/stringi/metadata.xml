		Fast and Portable Character String Processing Facilities // A
		collection of character string/text/natural language processing
		tools for pattern searching (e.g., with 'Java'-like regular
		expressions or the 'Unicode' collation algorithm), random
		string generation, case mapping, string transliteration,
		concatenation, sorting, padding, wrapping, Unicode
		normalisation, date-time formatting and parsing, and many more.
		They are fast, consistent, convenient, and - thanks to 'ICU'
		(International Components for Unicode) - portable across all
		locales and platforms. Documentation about 'stringi' is
		provided via its website at https://stringi.gagolewski.com/ and
		the paper by Gagolewski (2022, doi:10.18637/jss.v103.i02).
