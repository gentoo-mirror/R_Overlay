		The MBESS R Package // Implements methods that are useful in
		designing research studies and analyzing data, with particular
		emphasis on methods that are developed for or used within the
		behavioral, educational, and social sciences (broadly defined).
		That being said, many of the methods implemented within MBESS
		are applicable to a wide variety of disciplines. MBESS has a
		suite of functions for a variety of related topics, such as
		effect sizes, confidence intervals for effect sizes (including
		standardized effect sizes and noncentral effect sizes), sample
		size planning (from the accuracy in parameter estimation
		[AIPE], power analytic, equivalence, and minimum-risk point
		estimation perspectives), mediation analysis, various
		properties of distributions, and a variety of utility
		functions. MBESS (pronounced 'em-bes') was originally an
		acronym for 'Methods for the Behavioral, Educational, and
		Social Sciences,' but MBESS became more general and now
		contains methods applicable and used in a wide variety of
		fields and is an orphan acronym, in the sense that what was an
		acronym is now literally its name. MBESS has greatly benefited
		from others, see https://www3.nd.edu/~kkelley/site/MBESS.html
		for a detailed list of those that have contributed and other
		details.
