		The MBESS R Package // Implements methods that useful in
		designing research studies and analyzing data, with particular
		emphasis on methods that are developed for or used within the
		behavioral, educational, and social sciences (broadly defined).
		That being said, many of the methods implemented within MBESS
		are applicable to a wide variety of disciplines. MBESS has a
		suite of functions for a variety of related topics, such as
		effect sizes, confidence intervals for effect sizes (including
		standardized effect sizes and noncentral effect sizes), sample
		size planning (from the accuracy in parameter estimation
		[AIPE], power analytic, equivalence, and minimum-risk point
		estimation perspectives), mediation analysis, various
		properties of distributions, and a variety of utility
		functions. MBESS (pronounced 'em-bes') was originally an
		acronym for 'Methods for the Behavioral, Educational, and
		Social Sciences,' but at this point MBESS contains methods
		applicable and used in a wide variety of fields and is an
		orphan acronym, in the sense that what was an acronym is now
		literally its name. MBESS has greatly benefited from others,
		see http://nd.edu/~kkelley/site/MBESS.html for a detailed list
		of those that have contributed and other details.
