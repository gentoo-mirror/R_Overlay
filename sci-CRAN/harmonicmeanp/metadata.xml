		Harmonic Mean p-Values and Model Averaging by Mean Maximum
		Likelihood // The harmonic mean p-value (HMP) test combines
		p-values and corrects for multiple testing while controlling
		the family-wise error rate in a way that is more powerful than
		common alternatives including Bonferroni and Simes procedures,
		more stringent than controlling the false discovery rate, and
		is robust to positive correlations between tests and unequal
		weights. It is a multi-level test in the sense that a superset
		of one or more significant tests is certain to be significant
		and conversely when the superset is non-significant, the
		constituent tests are certain to be non-significant. It is
		based on MAMML (model averaging by mean maximum likelihood), a
		frequentist analogue to Bayesian model averaging, and is
		theoretically grounded in generalized central limit theorem.
		For detailed examples type vignette("harmonicmeanp") after
		installation.
