		Harmonic Mean p-Values and Model Averaging by Mean Maximum
		Likelihood // The harmonic mean p-value (HMP) test combines
		p-values and corrects for multiple testing while controlling
		the strong-sense family-wise error rate. It is more powerful
		than common alternatives including Bonferroni and Simes
		procedures when combining large proportions of all the
		p-values, at the cost of slightly lower power when combining
		small proportions of all the p-values. It is more stringent
		than controlling the false discovery rate, and possesses
		theoretical robustness to positive correlations between tests
		and unequal weights. It is a multi-level test in the sense that
		a superset of one or more significant tests is certain to be
		significant and conversely when the superset is non-
		significant, the constituent tests are certain to be non-
		significant. It is based on MAMML (model averaging by mean
		maximum likelihood), a frequentist analogue to Bayesian model
		averaging, and is theoretically grounded in generalized central
		limit theorem. For detailed examples type
		vignette("harmonicmeanp") after installation. Version 3.0
		addresses errors in versions 1.0 and 2.0 that led function
		p.hmp to control the familywise error rate only in the weak
		sense, rather than the strong sense as intended.
