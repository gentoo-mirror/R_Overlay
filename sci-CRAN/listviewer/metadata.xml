		'htmlwidget' for Interactive Views of R Lists // R lists,
		especially nested lists, can be very difficult to visualize or
		represent. Sometimes 'str()' is not enough, so this suite of
		htmlwidgets is designed to help see, understand, and maybe even
		modify your R lists.  The function 'reactjson()' requires a
		package 'reactR' that can be installed from CRAN or
		https://github.com/timelyportfolio/reactR.
