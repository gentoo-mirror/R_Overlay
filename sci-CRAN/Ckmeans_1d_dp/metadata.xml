		Optimal and Fast Univariate Clustering // Fast optimal univariate
		clustering and segementation by dynamic programming. Three
		types of problem including univariate k-means, k-median, and
		k-segments are solved with guaranteed optimality and
		reproducibility. The core algorithm minimizes the sum of
		within-cluster distances using respective metrics. Its
		advantage over heuristic clustering algorithms in efficiency
		and accuracy is increasingly pronounced as the number of
		clusters k increases. Weighted k-means and unweighted
		k-segments algorithms can also optimally segment time series
		and perform peak calling. An auxiliary function generates
		histograms that are adaptive to patterns in data. In contrast
		to heuristic methods, this package provides a powerful set of
		tools for univariate data analysis with guaranteed optimality.
