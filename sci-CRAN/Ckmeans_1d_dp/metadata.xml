		Optimal and Fast Univariate Clustering // A fast dynamic
		programming algorithmic framework to achieve optimal univariate
		k-means, k-median, and k-segments clustering. Minimizing the
		sum of respective within-cluster distances, the algorithms
		guarantee optimality and reproducibility. Their advantage over
		heuristic clustering algorithms in efficiency and accuracy is
		increasingly pronounced as the number of clusters k increases.
		Weighted k-means and unweighted k-segments algorithms can also
		optimally segment time series and perform peak calling. An
		auxiliary function generates histograms that are adaptive to
		patterns in data. This package provides a powerful alternative
		to heuristic methods for univariate data analysis.
