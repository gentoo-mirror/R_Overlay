		Optimal, Fast, and Reproducible Univariate Clustering // Fast,
		optimal, and reproducible weighted univariate clustering by
		dynamic programming. Four problem are solved, including
		univariate k-means (Wang  Song 2011) doi:10.32614/RJ-2011-015
		(Song  Zhong 2020) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa613,
		k-median, k-segments, and multi-channel weighted k-means.
		Dynamic programming is used to minimize the sum of (weighted)
		within-cluster distances using respective metrics. Its
		advantage over heuristic clustering in efficiency and accuracy
		is pronounced at a large number of clusters. Weighted k-means
		can also process time series to perform peak calling. Multi-
		channel weighted k-means groups multiple univariate signals
		into k clusters. An auxiliary function generates histograms
		adaptive to patterns in data. This package provides a powerful
		set of tools for univariate data analysis with guaranteed
		optimality, efficiency, and reproducibility.
