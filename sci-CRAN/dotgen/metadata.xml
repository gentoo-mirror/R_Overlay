		Gene-Set Analysis via Decorrelation by Orthogonal Transformation
		// Decorrelates a set of summary statistics (i.e., Z-scores or
		P-values per SNP) via Decorrelation by Orthogonal
		Transformation (DOT) approach and performs gene-set analyses by
		combining transformed statistic values; operations are
		performed with algorithms that rely only on the association
		summary results and the linkage disequilibrium (LD). For more
		details on DOT and its power, see Olga (2020)
