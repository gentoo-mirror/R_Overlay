		Lyapunov Exponents and Kaplan-Yorke Dimension // Estimation of
		the spectrum of Lyapunov Exponents and the Kaplan-Yorke
		dimension of any low-dimensional model of polynomial form. It
		can be applied, for example, to systems such as the chaotic
		Lorenz-1963 system or the hyperchaotic Rossler-1979 system. It
		can also be applied to dynamical models in Ordinary
		Differential Equations (ODEs) directly obtained from
		observational time series using the 'GPoM' package. The
		approach used is semi-formal, the Jacobian matrix being
		estimated automatically from the polynomial equations. Two
		methods are made available; one introduced by Wolf et al.
		(1985) doi:10.1016/0167-2789(85)90011-9 and the other one
		introduced by Grond et al. (2003)
		doi:10.1016/S0960-0779(02)00479-4. The package is provided with
		an interface for a more intuitive usage, it can also be run
		without the interface. This platform is developed at the Centre
		d'Etudes Spatiales de la Biosphere (CESBIO), UMR 5126
		UPS/CNRS/CNES/IRD, 18 av. Edouard Belin, 31401 TOULOUSE,
		FRANCE. The developments were funded by the French program Les
		Enveloppes Fluides et l'Environnement (LEFE, MANU, projects
		GloMo, SpatioGloMo and MoMu). The French programs Defi InFiNiTi
		(CNRS) and PNTS (CNRS) are also acknowledged (projects Crops'I
		Chaos and Musc  SlowFast).
