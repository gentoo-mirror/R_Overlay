		Smartly Create Maps from R Objects // Preview spatial data as
		'leaflet' maps with minimal effort. smartmap is optimized for
		interactive use and distinguishes itself from similar packages
		because it does not need real spatial ('sp' or 'sf') objects an
		input; instead, it tries to automatically coerce everything
		that looks like spatial data to sf objects or leaflet maps. It
		- for example - supports direct mapping of: a vector containing
		a single coordinate pair, a two column matrix, a data.frame
		with longitude and latitude columns, or the path or URL to a
		(possibly compressed) 'shapefile'.
