		Obtain and Analyze Daily Rainfall Data from the USA Climate
		Prediction Center (CPC) // The Climate Prediction Center's
		(CPC) rainfall data for the world (1979 to present, 50 km
		resolution) and the USA (1948 to present, 25 km resolution), is
		one of the few high quality, long term, observation based,
		daily rainfall products available for free. Although raw data
		is available at CPC's ftp site, obtaining, processing and
		visualizing the data is not straightforward. There are
		thousands of files, and file formats and file extensions have
		been changing over time. This package provides functionality to
		download, process and visualize over 40 years of global
		rainfall data and over 70 years of USA rainfall data from CPC.
