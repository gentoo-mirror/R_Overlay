		A Fast and Scalable Exhaustive Feature Selection Framework // The
		goal of this package is to provide an easy to use, fast and
		scalable exhaustive search framework. Exhaustive feature
		selections typically require a very large number of models to
		be fitted and evaluated. Execution speed and memory management
		are crucial factors here. This package provides solutions for
		both. Execution speed is optimized by using a multi-threaded
		C++ backend, and memory issues are solved by by only storing
		the best results during execution and thus keeping memory usage
		constant.
