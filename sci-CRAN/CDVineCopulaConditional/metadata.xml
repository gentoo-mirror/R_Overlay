		Sampling from Conditional C- and D-Vine Copulas // Provides tools
		for sampling from a conditional copula density decomposed via
		Pair-Copula Constructions as C- or D- vine. Here, the vines
		which can be used for such a sampling are those which sample as
		first the conditioning variables (when following the sampling
		algorithms shown in Aas et al. (2009)
		DOI:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2007.02.001). The used sampling
		algorithm is presented and discussed in Bevacqua et al. (2017)
		DOI:10.5194/hess-2016-652, and it is a modified version of that
		from Aas et al. (2009) DOI:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2007.02.001. A
		function is available to select the best vine (based on
		information criteria) among those which allow for such a
		conditional sampling. The package includes a function to
		compare scatterplot matrices and pair-dependencies of two
		multivariate datasets.
