		Competing Risk in Dependent Net Survival Analysis // Provides
		statistical tools for analyzing net and relative survival, with
		a key feature of relaxing the assumption of independent
		censoring and incorporating the effect of dependent competing
		risks. It employs a copula-based methodology, specifically the
		Archimedean copula, to simulate data, conduct survival
		analysis, and offer comparisons with other methods. This
		approach is detailed in the work of Adatorwovor et al. (2022)
