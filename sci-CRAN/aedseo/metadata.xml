		Automated and Early Detection of Seasonal Epidemic Onset and
		Burden Levels // A powerful tool for automating the early
		detection of seasonal epidemic onsets in time series data. It
		offers the ability to estimate growth rates across consecutive
		time intervals, calculate the sum of cases (SoC) within those
		intervals, and estimate seasonal onsets within user defined
		seasons. With use of a disease-specific threshold it also
		offers the possibility to estimate seasonal onset of epidemics.
		Additionally it offers the ability to estimate burden levels
		for seasons based on historical data. It is aimed towards
		epidemiologists, public health professionals, and researchers
		seeking to identify and respond to seasonal epidemics in a
		timely fashion.
