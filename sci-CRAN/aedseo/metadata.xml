		Automated and Early Detection of Seasonal Epidemic Onset // A
		powerful tool for automating the early detection of seasonal
		epidemic onsets in time series data. It offers the ability to
		estimate growth rates for consecutive time intervals and
		calculate the sum of cases (SoC) within those intervals. It is
		particularly useful for epidemiologists, public health
		professionals, and researchers seeking to identify and respond
		to seasonal epidemics in a timely fashion. For reference on
		growth rate estimation, see Walling and Lipstich (2007)
		doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3754 and Obadia et al. (2012)
