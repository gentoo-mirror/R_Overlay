		Serial Interval and Case Reproduction Number Estimation //
		Provides methods to estimate serial intervals and time-varying
		case reproduction numbers from infectious disease outbreak
		data. Serial intervals measure the time between symptom onset
		in linked transmission pairs, while case reproduction numbers
		quantify how many secondary cases each infected individual
		generates over time. These parameters are essential for
		understanding transmission dynamics, evaluating control
		measures, and informing public health responses. The package
		implements the maximum likelihood framework from Vink et al.
		(2014) doi:10.1093/aje/kwu209 for serial interval estimation
		and the retrospective method from Wallinga  Lipsitch (2007)
		doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3754 for reproduction number estimation.
		Originally developed for scabies transmission analysis but
		applicable to other infectious diseases including influenza,
		COVID-19, and emerging pathogens. Designed for epidemiologists,
		public health researchers, and infectious disease modelers
		working with outbreak surveillance data.
