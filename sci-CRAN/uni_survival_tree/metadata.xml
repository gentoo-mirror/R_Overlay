		A Survival Tree Based on Stabilized Score Tests for High-
		dimensional Covariates // A classification (decision) tree is
		constructed from survival data with high-dimensional
		covariates. The method is a robust version of the logrank tree,
		where the variance is stabilized. The main function "uni.tree"
		returns a classification tree for a given survival dataset. The
		inner nodes (splitting criterion) are selected by minimizing
		the P-value of the two-sample the score tests. The decision of
		declaring terminal nodes (stopping criterion) is the P-value
		threshold given by an argument (specified by user). This tree
		construction algorithm is proposed by Emura et al. (2021, in
		review).
