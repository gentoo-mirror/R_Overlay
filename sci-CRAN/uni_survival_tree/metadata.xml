		A Survival Tree Based on Stabilized Score Tests // A
		classification (decision) tree is constructed from survival
		data. The method is a robust version of the logrank tree, where
		the variance is stabilized. This function returns a
		classification tree for a given survival dataset. The decision
		of making inner nodes (splitting criterion) is based on the
		univariate score tests. The decision of declaring terminal
		nodes (stopping criterion) is the P-value threshold given by an
		argument. This tree construction algorithm is proposed by Emura
		et al. (2021, in review).
