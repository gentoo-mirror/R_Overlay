		Copula-Based Semiparametric Analysis for Time Series Data with
		Detection Limits // Semiparametric estimation for censored time
		series with lower detection limit. The latent response is a
		sequence of stationary process with Markov property of order
		one. Estimation of copula parameter(COPC) and Conditional
		quantile estimation are included for five available copula
		functions. Copula selection methods based on L2 distance from
		empirical copula function are also included.
