		Joint Discretization of Data on a Grid that Preserves Clusters //
		Discretize continuous multivariate data using a grid that
		captures the joint distribution via preserving clusters in the
		original data. Joint grid discretization is applicable as a
		data transformation step in methods inferring dependency by
		association, function, or causality with assuming a parametric
		model.
