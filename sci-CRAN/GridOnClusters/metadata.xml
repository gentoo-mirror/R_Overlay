		Joint Discretization of Data on a Grid that Preserves Clusters //
		Discretize multivariate continuous data using a grid that
		captures the joint distribution via preserving clusters in the
		original data. Joint grid discretization is applicable as a
		data transformation step before using other methods to infer
		association, function, or causality without assuming a
		parametric model.
