		Nuclear Decay Data for Dosimetric Calculations - ICRP 107 //
		Nuclear Decay Data for Dosimetric Calculations from the
		International Commission on Radiological Protection from ICRP
		Publication 107. Ann. ICRP 38 (3). Eckerman, Keith and Endo,
		Akira 2008 doi:10.1016/j.icrp.2008.10.004 https://www.icrp.org/
		publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20107. This is a database
		of the physical data needed in calculations of radionuclide-
		specific protection and operational quantities. The data is
		prescribed by the ICRP, the international authority on
		radiation dose standards, for estimating dose from the intake
		of or exposure to radionuclides in the workplace and the
		environment. The database contains information on the half-
		lives, decay chains, and yields and energies of radiations
		emitted in nuclear transformations of 1252 radionuclides of 97
		elements.
