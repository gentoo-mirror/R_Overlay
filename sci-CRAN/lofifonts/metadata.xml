		Text Rendering with Bitmap and Vector Fonts // Alternate font
		rendering is useful when rendering text to novel graphics
		outputs where modern font rendering is not available or where
		bespoke text positioning is required. Bitmap and vector fonts
		allow for custom layout and rendering using pixel coordinates
		and line drawing. Formatted text is created as a data.frame of
		pixel coordinates (for bitmap fonts) or stroke coordinates (for
		vector fonts).  All text can be easily previewed as a matrix or
		raster image. A selection of fonts is included with this
		package.
