		Agricultural Land Use Evaluation System // Evaluates land
		suitability for different crops production. The package is
		based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
		International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) methodology for
		land evaluation. Development of ALUES is inspired by similar
		tool for land evaluation, Land Use Suitability Evaluation Tool
		(LUSET). The package uses fuzzy logic approach to evaluate land
		suitability of a particular area based on inputs such as
		rainfall, temperature, topography, and soil properties. The
		membership functions used for fuzzy modeling are the following:
		Triangular, Trapezoidal and Gaussian. The methods for computing
		the overall suitability of a particular area are also included,
		and these are the Minimum, Maximum and Average. Finally, ALUES
		is a highly optimized library with core algorithms written in
		C++.
