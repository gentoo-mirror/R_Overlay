		Multilevel Latent Time Series Models with 'R' and 'Stan' // Fit
		multilevel manifest or latent time-series models, including
		popular Dynamic Structural Equation Models (DSEM). The models
		can be set up and modified with user-friendly functions and are
		fit to the data using 'Stan' for Bayesian inference. Path
		models and formulas for user-defined models can be easily
		created with functions using 'knitr'. Asparouhov, Hamaker,
