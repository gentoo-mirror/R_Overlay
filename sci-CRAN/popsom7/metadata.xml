		A Fast, User-Friendly Implementation of Self-Organizing Maps
		(SOMs) // Methods for building self-organizing maps (SOMs) with
		a number of distinguishing features such automatic centroid
		detection and cluster visualization using starbursts.  For more
		details see the paper "Improved Interpretability of the Unified
		Distance Matrix with Connected Components" by Hamel and Brown
		(2011) in ISBN:1-60132-168-6.  The package provides user-
		friendly access to two models we construct: (a) a SOM model and
		(b) a centroid based clustering model. The package also exposes
		a number of quality metrics for the quantitative evaluation of
		the map, Hamel (2016) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-28518-4_4.
		Finally, we reintroduced our fast, vectorized training
		algorithm for SOM with substantial improvements. It is about an
		order of magnitude faster than the canonical, stochastic C
		implementation doi:10.1007/978-3-030-01057-7_60.
