		Utilities for Dates and Times // Utilities for handling dates and
		times, such as selecting particular days of the week or month,
		formatting timestamps as required by RSS feeds, or converting
		timestamp representations of other software (such as 'MATLAB'
		and 'Excel') to R. The package is lightweight (no dependencies,
		pure R implementations) and relies only on R's standard classes
		to represent dates and times ('Date' and 'POSIXt'); it aims to
		provide efficient implementations, through vectorisation and
		the use of R's native numeric representations of timestamps
		where possible.
