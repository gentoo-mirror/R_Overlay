		Experiment-Selector CV-TMLE for Integration of Observational and
		RCT Data // The experiment selector cross-validated targeted
		maximum likelihood estimator (ES-CVTMLE) aims to select the
		experiment that optimizes the bias-variance tradeoff for
		estimating a causal average treatment effect (ATE) where
		different experiments may include a randomized controlled trial
		(RCT) alone or an RCT combined with real-world data. Using
		cross-validation, the ES-CVTMLE separates the selection of the
		optimal experiment from the estimation of the ATE for the
		chosen experiment. The estimated bias term in the selector is a
		function of the difference in conditional mean outcome under
		control for the RCT compared to the combined experiment. In
		order to help include truly unbiased external data in the
		analysis, the estimated average treatment effect on a negative
		control outcome may be added to the bias term in the selector.
		For more details about this method, please see Dang et al.
