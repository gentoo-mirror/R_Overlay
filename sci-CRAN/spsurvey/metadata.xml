		Spatial Survey Design and Analysis // These functions provide
		procedures for selecting sites for spatial surveys using
		spatially balanced algorithms applied to discrete points,
		linear networks, or polygons. The probability survey designs
		available include independent random samples, stratified random
		samples, and unequal probability random samples (categorical or
		probability proportional to size).  Design-based estimation
		based on the results from surveys is available for estimating
		totals, means, quantiles, CDFs, and linear models. The analyses
		rely on package survey for most results.  Variance estimation
		options include a local neighborhood variance estimator that is
		appropriate for spatially-balanced survey designs.  A reference
		for the survey design portion of the package is: D. L. Stevens,
		Jr. and A. R. Olsen (2004), "Spatially-balanced sampling of
		natural resources.", Journal of the American Statistical
		Association 99(465): 262-278, DOI:10.1198/016214504000000250.
		Additional helpful references for this package are A. R. Olsen,
		T. M. Kincaid, and Q. Payton (2012) and T. M. Kincaid and A. R.
		Olsen (2012), both of which are chapters in the book "Design
		and Analysis of Long-Term Ecological Monitoring Studies" (R. A.
		Gitzen, J. J. Millspaugh, A. B. Cooper, and D. S. Licht (eds.),
		Cambridge University Press, New York, Online
		ISBN:9781139022422).
