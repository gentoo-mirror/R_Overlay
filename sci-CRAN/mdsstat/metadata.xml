		Statistical Trending for Medical Devices Surveillance // A
		collection of common statistical algorithms used in active
		surveillance of medical device events. Context includes post-
		market surveillance, pharmacovigilance, signal detection and
		trending, and regulatory reporting. Primary inputs are device-
		event time series. Outputs include trending results with the
		ability to run multiple algorithms at once. This package works
		well with the 'mds' package, but does not require it.
