		Prepare/Analyse Eye Tracking Data for Reading // Functions to
		prepare and analyse eye tracking data of reading exercises. The
		functions allow some basic data preparations and code fixations
		as first and second pass. First passes can be further devided
		into forward and reading. The package further allows for
		aggregating fixation times per AOI or per AOI and per type of
		pass (first forward, first rereading, second). These methods
		are based on Hyn, Lorch, and Rinck (2003)
		doi:10.1016/B978-044451020-4/50018-9 and Hyn, and Lorch (2004)
		doi:10.1016/j.learninstruc.2004.01.001. It is also possible to
		convert between metric length and visual degrees.
