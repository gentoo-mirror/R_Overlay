		Generalized Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging // Diffusion
		anisotropy has been used to characterize white matter neuronal
		pathways in the human brain, and infer global connectivity in
		the central nervous system. The package implements algorithms
		to estimate and visualize the orientation of neuronal pathways
		in model-free methods (q-space imaging methods). For estimating
		fibre orientations two methods have been implemented.  One
		method implements fibre orientation detection through local
		maxima extraction. A second more robust method is based on
		directional statistical clustering of ODF voxel data. Fibre
		orientations in multiple fibre voxels are estimated using a
		mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. This
		statistical estimation procedure is used to resolve crossing
		fibre configurations. Reconstruction of orientation
		distribution function (ODF) profiles may be performed using the
		standard generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) approach,
		Garyfallidis' GQI (GQI2) approach, or Aganj's variant of the
		Q-ball imaging (CSA-QBI) approach. Procedures for the
		visualization of RGB-maps, line-maps and glyph-maps of real
		diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data-sets are
		included in the package.
