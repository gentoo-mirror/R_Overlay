		Automated Setup and Auto Run for R Language Server // Allows to
		install the R 'languageserver' with all dependencies into a
		separate library and use that independent installation
		automatically when R is instantiated as a language server
		process. Useful for making language server seamless to use
		without running into package version conflicts.
