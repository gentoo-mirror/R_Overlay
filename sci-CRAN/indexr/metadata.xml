		A Thoughtful Saver of Results // Helps with the thoughtful
		saving, reading, and management of result files (using 'rds'
		files). The core functions take a list of parameters that are
		used to generate a unique hash to save results under. Then, the
		same parameter list can be used to read those results back in.
		This is helpful to avoid clunky file naming when running a
		large number of simulations. Additionally, helper functions are
		available for compiling a flat file of parameters of saved
		results, monitoring result usage, and cleaning up unwanted or
		unused results. For more information, visit the 'indexr'
		homepage https://lharris421.github.io/indexr/.
