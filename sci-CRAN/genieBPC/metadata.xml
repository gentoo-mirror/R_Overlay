		Project GENIE BioPharma Collaborative Data Processing Pipeline //
		The American Association Research (AACR) Project Genomics
		Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) BioPharma
		Collaborative represents a multi-year, multi-institution effort
		to build a pan-cancer repository of linked clinico-genomic
		data. The genomic and clinical data are provided in multiple
		releases (separate releases for each cancer cohort with updates
		following data corrections), which are stored on the data
		sharing platform 'Synapse' https://www.synapse.org/. The
		'genieBPC' package provides a seamless way to obtain the data
		corresponding to each release from 'Synapse' and to prepare
		datasets for analysis.
