		Classes for Storing and Manipulating Taxonomic Data // Provides
		classes for storing and manipulating taxonomic data. Most of
		the classes can be treated like base R vectors (e.g. can be
		used in tables as columns and can be named). Vectorized classes
		can store taxon names and authorities, taxon IDs from
		databases, taxon ranks, and other types of information. More
		complex classes are provided to store taxonomic trees and user-
		defined data associated with them.
