		The Picture of Probability // An eikosogram (ancient Greek for
		probability picture) divides the unit square into rectangular
		regions whose areas, sides, and widths, represent various
		probabilities associated with the values of one or more
		categorical variates. Rectangle areas are joint probabilities,
		widths are always marginal (though possibly joint margins, i.e.
		marginal joint distributions of two or more variates), and
		heights of rectangles are always conditional probabilities.
		Eikosograms embed the rules of probability and are useful for
		introducing elementary probability theory, including axioms,
		marginal, conditional, and joint probabilities, and their
		relationships (including Bayes theorem as a completely trivial
		consequence). They are markedly superior to Venn diagrams for
		this purpose, especially in distinguishing probabilistic
		independence, mutually exclusive events, coincident events, and
		associations. They also are useful for identifying and
		understanding conditional independence structure. As data
		analysis tools, eikosograms display categorical data in a
		manner similar to Mosaic plots, especially when only two
		variates are involved (the only case in which they are
		essentially identical, though eikosograms purposely disallow
		spacing between rectangles). Unlike Mosaic plots, eikosograms
		do not alternate axes as each new categorical variate (beyond
		two) is introduced. Instead, only one categorical variate,
		designated the "response", presents on the vertical axis and
		all others, designated the "conditioning" variates, appear on
		the horizontal. In this way, conditional probability appears
		only as height and marginal probabilities as widths. The
		eikosogram is therefore much better suited to a response model
		analysis (e.g. logistic model) than is a Mosaic plot. Mosaic
		plots are better suited to log-linear style modelling as in
		discrete multivariate analysis. Of course, eikosograms are also
		suited to discrete multivariate analysis with each variate in
		turn appearing as the response. This makes it better suited
		than Mosaic plots to discrete graphical models based on
		conditional independence graphs (i.e. "Bayesian Networks" or
		"BayesNets"). The eikosogram and its superiority to Venn
		diagrams in teaching probability is described in W.H. Cherry
		and R.W. Oldford (2003) https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/pap
		ers/eikosograms/paper.pdf, its value in exploring conditional
		independence structure and relation to graphical and log-linear
		models is described in R.W. Oldford (2003) https://math.uwaterl
		oo.ca/~rwoldfor/papers/eikosograms/independence/paper.pdf, and
		a number of problems, puzzles, and paradoxes that are easily
		explained with eikosograms are given in R.W. Oldford (2003) htt
