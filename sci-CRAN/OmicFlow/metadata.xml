		Fast and Efficient (Automated) Analysis of Sparse Omics Data // A
		generalised data structure for fast and efficient loading and
		data munching of sparse omics data. The 'OmicFlow' requires an
		up-front validated metadata template from the user, which
		serves as a guide to connect all the pieces together by
		aligning them into a single object that is defined as an
		'omics' class. Once this unified structure is established,
		users can perform manual subsetting, visualisation, and
		statistical analysis, or leverage the automated 'autoFlow'
		method to generate a comprehensive report.
