		Make Banner Comments with a Consistent Format // A convenience
		package for use while drafting code. It facilitates making
		stand-out comment lines decorated with bands of characters.
		The input text strings are converted into R comment lines,
		suitably formatted. These are then displayed in a console
		window and, if possible, automatically transferred to a
		clipboard ready for pasting into an R script.  Designed to save
		time when drafting R scripts that will need to be navigated and
		maintained by other programmers.
