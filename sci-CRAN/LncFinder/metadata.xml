		LncRNA Identification and Analysis Using Heterologous Features //
		Long non-coding RNAs identification and analysis. Default
		models are trained with human, mouse and wheat datasets by
		employing SVM. Features are based on intrinsic composition of
		sequence, EIIP value (electron-ion interaction
		pseudopotential), and secondary structure. This package can
		also extract other classic features and build new classifiers.
