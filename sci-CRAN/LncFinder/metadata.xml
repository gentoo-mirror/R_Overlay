		Long Non-Coding RNA Identification Based on Features of Sequence,
		EIIP and Secondary Structure // Functions for predicting
		sequences are mRNAs or long non-coding RNAs. Default models are
		trained on human, mouse and wheat datasets by employing SVM.
		Features are based on intrinsic composition of sequence, EIIP
		value (electron-ion interaction pseudopotential) and secondary
		structure. The model can also be built on users' own data.
