		Convert 'tinytest' Output to JUnit XML // Unit testing is a solid
		component of automated CI/CD pipelines. 'tinytest' - a
		lightweight, zero-dependency  alternative to 'testthat' was
		developed. To be able to integrate 'tinytests' results into
		common CI/CD systems the test results from tinytest need to be
		caputred and converted to JUnit XML format. 'tinytest2JUnit'
		enables this conversion while staying also lightweight and only
		have 'tinytest' as its dependency.
