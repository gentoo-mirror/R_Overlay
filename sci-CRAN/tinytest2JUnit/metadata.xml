		Convert 'tinytest' Output to JUnit XML // Unit testing is a solid
		component of automated CI/CD pipelines. 'tinytest' - a light-
		weight, zero-dependency  alternative to 'testthat' was
		developed. To be able to integrate 'tinytests' results into
		common CI/CD systems the 'tinytests'-object needs to be
		converted to JUnit XML format. 'tinytest2JUnit' enables this
		conversion while keeping the zero-dependency nature.
