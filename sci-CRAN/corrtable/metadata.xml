		Creates and Saves Out a Correlation Table with Significance
		Levels Indicated // After using this, a publication-ready
		correlation table with p-values indicated will be created.  The
		input can be a full data frame; any string and Boolean terms
		will be dropped as part of functionality.  Correlations and
		p-values are calculated using the 'Hmisc' framework.  Output of
		the correlation_matrix() function is a table of strings; this
		gets saved out to a '.csv2' with the save_correlation_matrix()
		function for easy insertion into a paper. For more details
		about the process, consult

		correlation-matrix-significance-r/.
