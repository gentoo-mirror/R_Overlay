		Automated Topic Labeling with Language Models // Leveraging
		(large) language models for automatic topic labeling. The main
		function converts a list of top terms into a label for each
		topic. Hence, it is complementary to any topic modeling package
		that produces a list of top terms for each topic. While human
		judgement is indispensable for topic validation (i.e.,
		inspecting top terms and most representative documents),
		automatic topic labeling can be a valuable tool for researchers
		in various scenarios.
