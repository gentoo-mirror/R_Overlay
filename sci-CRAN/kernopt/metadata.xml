		Estimating Count Data Distributions with Discrete Optimal
		Symmetric Kernel // Implementation of Discrete Symmetric
		Optimal Kernel for estimating count data distributions, as
		described by T. Senga Kiess and G. Durrieu (2024)
		doi:10.1016/j.spl.2024.110078.The nonparametric estimator using
		the discrete symmetric optimal kernel was illustrated on
		simulated data sets and a real-word data set included in the
		package, in comparison with two other discrete symmetric
		kernels.
