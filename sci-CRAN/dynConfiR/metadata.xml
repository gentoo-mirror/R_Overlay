		Dynamic Models for Confidence and Response Time Distributions //
		Provides density functions for the joint distribution of
		choice, response time and confidence for discrete confidence
		judgments as well as functions for parameter fitting,
		prediction and simulation for various dynamical models of
		decision confidence. All models are explained in detail by
		Hellmann et al. (preprint; https://osf.io/9jfqr/). Implemented
		models are the dynWEV model, the 2DSD model (Pleskac
		Busemeyer, 2010, doi:10.1037/a0019737), and various race
		models. C++ code for dynWEV and 2DSD is based on the 'rtdists'
		package by Henrik Singmann.
