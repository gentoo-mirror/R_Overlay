		Dynamic Models for Confidence and Response Time Distributions //
		Provides density functions for the joint distribution of
		choice, response time and confidence for discrete confidence
		judgments as well as functions for parameter fitting,
		prediction and simulation for various dynamical models of
		decision confidence.  All models are explained in detail by
		Hellmann et al.  (2023; Preprint available at
		https://osf.io/9jfqr/, published version:
		doi:10.1037/rev0000411).  Implemented models are the dynaViTE
		model, dynWEV model, the 2DSD model (Pleskac  Busemeyer, 2010,
		doi:10.1037/a0019737), and various race models.  C++ code for
		dynWEV and 2DSD is based on the 'rtdists' package by Henrik
		Singmann.
