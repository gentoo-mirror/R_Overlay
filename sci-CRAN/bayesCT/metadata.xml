		Simulation and Analysis of Adaptive Bayesian Clinical Trials //
		Simulation and analysis of Bayesian adaptive clinical trials
		for binomial, Gaussian, and time-to-event data types,
		incorporates historical data and allows early stopping for
		futility or early success. The package uses novel and efficient
		Monte Carlo methods for estimating Bayesian posterior
		probabilities, evaluation of loss to follow up, and imputation
		of incomplete data. The package has the functionality for
		dynamically incorporating historical data into the analysis via
		the power prior or non-informative priors.
