		Multivariate Birth-Death Processes // Computationally efficient
		functions to provide direct likelihood-based inference for
		partially-observed multivariate birth-death processes.  Such
		processes range from a simple Yule model to the complex
		susceptible-infectious-removed model in disease dynamics.
		Efficient likelihood evaluation facilitates maximum likelihood
		estimation and Bayesian inference.
