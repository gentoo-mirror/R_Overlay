		Arbitrary Dependency Mixed Multivariate Bayesian Models //
		Supports Bayesian models with full and partial (hence
		arbitrary) dependencies between random variables. Discrete and
		continuous variables are supported, and conditional joint
		probabilities and probability densities are estimated using
		Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The full general form, which
		implements an extension to Bayes' theorem, as well as the
		simple form, which is just a Bayesian network, both support
		regression through segmentation and KDE and estimation of
		probability or relative likelihood of discrete or continuous
		target random variables. This package also provides true
		statistical distance measures based on Bayesian models.
		Furthermore, these measures can be facilitated on neighborhood
		searches, and to estimate the similarity and distance between
		data points. Related work is by Bayes (1763)
		doi:10.1098/rstl.1763.0053 and by Scutari (2010)
