		Noisy Stochastic Block Mode: Graph Inference by Multiple Testing
		// Variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to fit the
		noisy stochastic block model to an observed dense graph and to
		perform a node clustering. Moreover, a graph inference
		procedure to recover the underlying binary graph. This
		procedure comes with a control of the false discovery rate. The
		method is described in the article "Powerful graph inference
		with false discovery rate control" by T. Rebafka, E. Roquain,
		F. Villers (2020) arXiv:1907.10176.
