		Hidden Markov Models for Multivariate Panel Data // Estimates
		hidden Markov models from the family of Cholesky-decomposed
		Gaussian hidden Markov models (CDGHMM) under various
		missingness schemes. This family improves upon estimation of
		traditional Gaussian HMMs by directly modelling the distinct
		correlation structures that arise from longitudinal data, as
		well as, controlling for dropped out observations and non-
		random missingness. See Neal, Sochaniwsky and McNicholas (2024)
