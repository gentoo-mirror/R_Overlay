		Power Analysis Tools for Multilevel Randomized Experiments //
		Includes tools to calculate statistical power, minimum
		detectable effect size (MDES), MDES difference (MDESD), and
		minimum required sample size for various multilevel randomized
		experiments with continuous outcomes. Some of the functions can
		assist with planning two- and three-level cluster-randomized
		trials (CRTs) sensitive to multilevel moderation and mediation
		(2-1-1, 2-2-1, and 3-2-1). See 'PowerUp!' Excel series at
		https://www.causalevaluation.org/.
