		Power Analysis Tools for Multilevel Randomized Experiments //
		Includes tools to calculate statistical power, minimum
		detectable effect size (MDES), MDES difference (MDESD), and
		minimum required sample size for various multilevel randomized
		experiments (MRE) with continuous outcomes. Accomodates 14
		types of MRE designs to detect main treatment effect, seven
		types of MRE designs to detect moderated treatment effect
		(2-1-1, 2-1-2, 2-2-1, 2-2-2, 3-3-1, 3-3-2, and 3-3-3 designs;
		total.lev - trt.lev - mod.lev), five types of MRE designs to
		detect mediated treatment effects (2-1-1, 2-2-1, 3-1-1, 3-2-1,
		and 3-3-1 designs; trt.lev - med.lev - out.lev), four types of
		partially nested (PN) design to detect main treatment effect,
		and three types of PN designs to detect mediated treatment
		effects (2/1, 3/1, 3/2; trt.arm.lev / ctrl.arm.lev). See
		'PowerUp!' Excel series at https://www.causalevaluation.org/.
