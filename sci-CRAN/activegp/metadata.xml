		Gaussian Process Based Design and Analysis for the Active
		Subspace Method // The active subspace method is a sensitivity
		analysis technique that finds important linear combinations of
		input variables for a simulator. This package provides
		functions allowing estimation of the active subspace without
		gradient information using Gaussian processes as well as
		sequential experimental design tools to minimize the amount of
		data required to do so. Implements Wycoff et al. (2019)
		arXiv:1907.11572.
