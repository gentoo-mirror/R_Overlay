		Genome-Wide Discovery of Pre-miRNAs with few Labeled Examples //
		Machine learning method specifically designed for pre-miRNA
		prediction. It takes advantage of unlabeled sequences to
		improve the prediction rates even when there are just a few
		positive examples, when the negative examples are unreliable or
		are not good representatives of its class. Furthermore, the
		method can automatically search for negative examples if the
		user is unable to provide them. MiRNAss can find a good
		boundary to divide the pre-miRNAs from other groups of
		sequences; it automatically optimizes the threshold that
		defines the classes boundaries, and thus, it is robust to high
		class imbalance. Each step of the method is scalable and can
		handle large volumes of data.
