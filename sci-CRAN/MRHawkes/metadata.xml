		Multivariate Renewal Hawkes Process // Simulate a (bivariate)
		multivariate renewal Hawkes (MRHawkes) self-exciting process,
		with given immigrant hazard rate functions and offspring
		density function. Calculate the likelihood of a MRHawkes
		process with given hazard rate functions and offspring density
		function for an (increasing) sequence of event times. Calculate
		the Rosenblatt residuals of the event times. Predict future
		event times based on observed event times up to a given time.
