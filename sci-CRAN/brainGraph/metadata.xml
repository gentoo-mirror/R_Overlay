		Graph Theory Analysis of Brain MRI Data // A set of tools for
		performing graph theory analysis of brain MRI data. It works
		with data from a Freesurfer analysis (cortical thickness,
		volumes, local gyrification index, surface area), diffusion
		tensor tractography data (e.g., from FSL) and resting-state
		fMRI data (e.g., from DPABI). It contains a graphical user
		interface for graph visualization and data exploration, along
		with several functions for generating useful figures.
