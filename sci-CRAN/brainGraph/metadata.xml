		Graph Theory Analysis of Brain MRI Data // A set of tools for
		performing graph theory analysis of brain MRI data. It is best
		suited to data from a Freesurfer analysis (cortical thickness,
		volumes, local gyrification index, surface area), but also
		works with e.g., tractography data from FSL. It contains a
		graphical user interface for graph visualization and data
		exploration.
