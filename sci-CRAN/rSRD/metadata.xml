		Sum of Ranking Differences Statistical Test // We provide an
		implementation for Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD), a novel
		statistical test introduced by Hberger (2010)
		doi:10.1016/j.trac.2009.09.009. The test allows the comparison
		of different solutions through a reference by first performing
		a rank transformation on the input, then calculating and
		comparing the distances between the solutions and the reference
		- the latter is measured in the L1 norm. The reference can be
		an external benchmark (e.g. an established gold standard) or
		can be aggregated from the data. The calculated distances,
		called SRD scores, are validated in two ways, see Hberger and
		Kollr-Hunek (2011) doi:10.1002/cem.1320. A randomization test
		(also called permutation test) compares the SRD scores of the
		solutions to the SRD scores of randomly generated rankings. The
		second validation option is cross-validation that checks
		whether the rankings generated from the solutions come from the
		same distribution or not. For a detailed analysis about the
		cross-validation process see Sziklai, Baranyi and Hberger
		(2021) arXiv:2105.11939. The package offers a wide array of
		features related to SRD including the computation of the SRD
		scores, validation options, input preprocessing and plotting
		tools.
