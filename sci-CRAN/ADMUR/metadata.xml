		Ancient Demographic Modelling Using Radiocarbon // Provides tools
		to directly model underlying population dynamics using date
		datasets (radiocarbon and other) with a Continuous Piecewise
		Linear (CPL) model framework. Various other model types
		included. Taphonomic loss included optionally as a power
		function. Model comparison framework using BIC. Package also
		calibrates 14C samples, generates Summed Probability
		Distributions (SPD), and performs SPD simulation analysis to
		generate a Goodness-of-fit test for the best selected model.
		Details about the method can be found in Timpson A., Barberena
		R., Thomas M. G., Mendez C., Manning K. (2020)
