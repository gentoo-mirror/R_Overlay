		datasets (radiocarbon and other) with a Continuous Piecewise
		Linear (CPL) model framework. Various other model types
		included. Taphonomic loss included optionally as a power
		function. Model comparison framework using BIC. Package also
		calibrates 14C samples, generates Summed Probability
		Distributions (SPD), and performs SPD simulation analysis to
		generate a Goodness-of-fit test for the best selected model.
