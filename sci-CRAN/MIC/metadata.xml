		Analysis of Antimicrobial Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Data
		// Analyse, plot, and tabulate antimicrobial minimum inhibitory
		concentration (MIC) data. Validate the results of an MIC
		experiment by comparing observed MIC values to a gold standard
		assay, in line with standards from the International
		Organization for Standardization (2021)
		https://www.iso.org/standard/79377.html. Perform MIC prediction
		from whole genome sequence data stored in the Pathosystems
