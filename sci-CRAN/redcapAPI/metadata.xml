		Interface to 'REDCap' // Access data stored in 'REDCap' databases
		using the Application Programming Interface (API).  'REDCap'
		(Research Electronic Data CAPture; https://projectredcap.org)
		is a web application for building and managing online surveys
		and databases developed at Vanderbilt University.  The API
		allows users to access data and project meta data (such as the
		data dictionary) from the web programmatically. The 'redcapAPI'
		package facilitates the process of accessing data with options
		to prepare an analysis-ready data set consistent with the
		definitions in a database's data dictionary.
