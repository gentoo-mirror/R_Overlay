		Snow Profile Analysis for Snowpack and Avalanche Research //
		Analysis and plotting tools for snow profile data produced from
		manual snowpack observations and physical snowpack models. The
		functions in this package support snowpack and avalanche
		research by reading various formats of data (including CAAML,
		SMET, generic csv, and outputs from the snow cover model
		SNOWPACK), manipulate the data, and produce graphics such as
		stratigraphy and time series profiles. Package developed by the
		Simon Fraser University Avalanche Research Program
		http://www.avalancheresearch.ca. Graphics apply visualization
		concepts from Horton, Nowak, and Haegeli (2020,
		doi:10.5194/nhess-20-1557-2020).
