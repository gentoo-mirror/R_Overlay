		Hypothesis Testing Tree // A novel decision tree algorithm in the
		hypothesis testing framework. The algorithm examines the
		distribution difference between two child nodes over all
		possible binary partitions. The test statistic of the
		hypothesis testing is equivalent to the generalized energy
		distance, which enables the algorithm to be more powerful in
		detecting the complex structure, not only the mean difference.
		It is applicable for numeric, nominal, ordinal explanatory
		variables and the response in general metric space of strong
		negative type. The algorithm has superior performance compared
		to other tree models in type I error, power, prediction
		accuracy, and complexity.
