		Distance Density Clustering Algorithm // A distance density
		clustering (DDC) algorithm in R. DDC uses dynamic time warping
		(DTW) to compute a similarity matrix, based on which cluster
		centers and cluster assignments are found. DDC inherits dynamic
		time warping (DTW) arguments and constraints. The cluster
		centers are centroid points that are calculated using the DTW
		Barycenter Averaging (DBA) algorithm. The clustering process is
		divisive. At each iteration, cluster centers are updated and
		data is reassigned to cluster centers. Early stopping is
		possible. The output includes cluster centers and clustering
		assignment, as described in the paper (Ma et al (2017)
		doi:10.1109/ICDMW.2017.11).
