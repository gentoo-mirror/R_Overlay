		Robust and Sparse Methods for High Dimensional Linear and Binary
		and Multinomial Regression // Fully robust versions of the
		elastic net estimator are introduced for linear and binary and
		multinomial regression, in particular high dimensional data.
		The algorithm searches for outlier free subsets on which the
		classical elastic net estimators can be applied. A reweighting
		step is added to improve the statistical efficiency of the
		proposed estimators. Selecting appropriate tuning parameters
		for elastic net penalties are done via cross-validation.
