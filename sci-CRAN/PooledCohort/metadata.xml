		Predicted Risk for CVD using Pooled Cohort Equations, PREVENT
		Equations, and Other Contemporary CVD Risk Calculators // The
		2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart
		Association blood pressure guideline recommends using 10-year
		predicted atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk to guide
		the decision to initiate or intensify antihypertensive
		medication. The guideline recommends using the Pooled Cohort
		risk prediction equations to predict 10-year atherosclerotic
		cardiovascular disease risk. This package implements the
		original Pooled Cohort risk prediction equations and also
		incorporates updated versions based on more contemporary data
		and statistical methods.
