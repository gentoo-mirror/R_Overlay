		Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) // The Sequence of
		Physical Processes (SPP) framework is a way of interpreting the
		transient data derived from oscillatory rheological tests. It
		is designed to allow both the linear and non-linear deformation
		regimes to be understood within a single unified framework.
		This code provides a convenient way to determine the SPP
		framework metrics for a given sample of oscillatory data. It
		will produce a text file containing the SPP metrics, which the
		user can then plot using their software of choice. It can also
		produce a second text file with additional derived data
		(components of tangent, normal, and binormal vectors), as well
		as pre-plotted figures if so desired. It is the R version of
		the Package SPP by Simon Rogers Group for Soft Matter (Simon A.
		Rogers, Brian M. Erwin, Dimitris Vlassopoulos, Michel Cloitre
		(2011) doi:10.1122/1.3544591).
