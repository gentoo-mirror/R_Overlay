		Extract and Visualize Motif Information from MEME Software //
		Extract and visualize motif information from XML file from MEME
		software. In biology, a motif is a nucleotide or amino acid
		sequence pattern that is widespread and usually assumed to be
		related to specifical biological functions. There exist many
		software was used to discover motif sequences from a set of
		nucleotide or amino acid sequences. MEME is almost the most
		used software to detect motif. It's difficult for biologists to
