		Mixed FLP and ML Estimation of ETAS Space-Time Point Processes
		for Earthquake Description // Estimation of the components of
		an ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence) model for
		earthquake description. Non-parametric background seismicity
		can be estimated through FLP (Forward Likelihood Predictive).
		New version 2.0.0: covariates have been introduced to explain
		the effects of external factors on the induced seismicity; the
		parametrization has been changed; Chiodi, Adelfio
		(2017)doi:10.18637/jss.v076.i03.
