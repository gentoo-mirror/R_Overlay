		Performs Segmented Linear Regression on Two Independent Variables
		// Implements a specific form of segmented linear regression
		with two independent variables. The visualization of that
		function looks like a quarter segment of a cowbell giving the
		package its name. The package has been specifically constructed
		for the case where minimum and maximum value of the dependent
		and two independent variables are known a prior, which is
		usually the case when those values are derived from Likert
		scales.
