		Incremental Mixture Approximate Bayesian Computation (IMABC) //
		Provides functionality to perform a likelihood-free method for
		estimating the parameters of complex models that results in a
		simulated sample from the posterior distribution of model
		parameters given targets. The method begins with a
		accept/reject approximate bayes computation (ABC) step applied
		to a sample of points from the prior distribution of model
		parameters. Accepted points result in model predictions that
		are within the initially specified tolerance intervals around
		the target points. The sample is iteratively updated by drawing
		additional points from a mixture of multivariate normal
		distributions, accepting points within tolerance intervals. As
		the algorithm proceeds, the acceptance intervals are narrowed.
		The algorithm returns a set of points and sampling weights that
		account for the adaptive sampling scheme. For more details see
		Rutter, Ozik, DeYoreo, and Collier (2018) arXiv:1804.02090.
