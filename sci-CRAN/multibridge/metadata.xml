		Evaluating Multinomial Order Restrictions with Bridge Sampling //
		Evaluate hypotheses concerning the distribution of multinomial
		proportions using bridge sampling. The bridge sampling routine
		is able to compute Bayes factors for hypotheses that entail
		inequality constraints, equality constraints, free parameters,
		and mixtures of all three. These hypotheses are tested against
		the encompassing hypothesis, that all parameters vary freely or
		against the null hypothesis that all category proportions are
		equal. For more information see Sarafoglou et al. (2020)
