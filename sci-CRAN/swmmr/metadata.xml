		R Interface for US EPA's SWMM // Functions to connect the widely
		used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) of the United States
		Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) https://www.epa.gov
		/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm to R with
		currently two main goals: (1) Run a SWMM simulation from R and
		(2) provide fast access to simulation results, i.e. SWMM's
		binary '.out'-files. High performance is achieved with help of
		Rcpp. Additionally, reading SWMM's '.inp'-files is supported to
		glance model structures.
