		Linear Regression Interface // An interface to accelerate linear
		regression (Ordinary least squares) modelling, which allows
		users to build models quickly, while automatically generating
		interactive visualizations of the results. Non-linear models
		specification (e.g. y = b1*x1 + b2*log(x2)) can be easily
		constructed using user-defined transformations. Functions for
		testing wide ranges of model specifications (e.g. y =
		b*log(x,10) , y = b*log(x,20) , ...), all at once, are also
		available. Finally, models can be imported and exported as
		Excel files where all the information necessary for re-running
		the models is stored in separate sheets.
