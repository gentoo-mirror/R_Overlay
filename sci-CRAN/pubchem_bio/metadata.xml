		Biologically Informed Metabolomic Databases from 'PubChem' // All
		'PubChem' compounds are downloaded to a local computer, but for
		each compound, only partial records are used.  The data are
		organized into small files referenced by 'PubChem' CID.  This
		package also contains functions to parse the biologically
		relevant compounds from all 'PubChem' compounds, using
		biological database sources, pathway presence, and taxonomic
		relationships. Taxonomy is used to generate a lowest common
		ancestor taxonomy ID (NCBI) for each biological metabolite,
		which then enables creation of taxonomically specific
		metabolome databases for any taxon.
