		Pattern Analysis Across Contingency Tables // Statistical
		hypothesis testing of pattern heterogeneity via differences in
		underlying distributions across multiple contingency tables.
		Five tests are included: the comparative chi-squared test (Song
		et al. 2014) doi:10.1093/nar/gku086 (Zhang et al. 2015)
		doi:10.1093/nar/gkv358, the Sharma-Song test, the heterogeneity
		test, the marginal-change test (Sharma et al. 2020), and the
		strength test (Sharma et al. 2020). Under the null hypothesis
		that row and column variables are statistically independent and
		joint distributions are equal, their test statistics all follow
		an asymptotically chi-squared distribution. A comprehensive
		type analysis categorizes the relation among the contingency
		tables into type null, 0, 1, and 2 (Sharma et al. 2020). They
		can identify heterogeneous patterns that differ in either the
		first order (marginal) or the second order (joint distribution
		deviation from product of marginals). Second-order differences
		may reveal more fundamental changes than first-order
		differences across heterogeneous patterns.
