		Pattern Heterogeneity via Distributional Differences Across
		Contingency Tables // Statistical hypothesis testing of pattern
		heterogeneity via differences in underlying distributions
		across two or more contingency tables. Three tests are
		included: the comparative chi-squared test (Song et al, 2014)
		doi:10.1093/nar/gku086 (Zhang et al, 2015)
		doi:10.1093/nar/gkv358, the Sharma-Song test, and the
		heterogeneity test. Under the null hypothesis that row and
		column variables are statistically independent and joint
		distributions are equal, their test statistics all follow an
		asymptotically chi-squared distribution. These options test for
		heterogeneous patterns that differ in either the first order
		(marginal) or the second order (joint distribution deviation
		from product of marginals). Second-order differences may reveal
		more fundamental changes than first-order differences across
		heterogeneous patterns.
