		Pattern Analysis Across Contingency Tables // Statistical
		hypothesis testing of pattern heterogeneity via differences in
		underlying distributions across multiple contingency tables.
		Five tests are included: the comparative chi-squared test (Song
		et al. 2014) doi:10.1093/nar/gku086 (Zhang et al. 2015)
		doi:10.1093/nar/gkv358, the Sharma-Song test (Sharma et al.
		2021) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab240, the heterogeneity
		test, the marginal-change test (Sharma et al. 2020)
		doi:10.1145/3388440.3412485, and the strength test (Sharma et
		al. 2020) doi:10.1145/3388440.3412485. Under the null
		hypothesis that row and column variables are statistically
		independent and joint distributions are equal, their test
		statistics all follow an asymptotically chi-squared
		distribution. A comprehensive type analysis categorizes the
		relation among the contingency tables into type null, 0, 1, and
		2 (Sharma et al. 2020) doi:10.1145/3388440.3412485. They can
		identify heterogeneous patterns that differ in either the first
		order (marginal) or the second order (differential departure
		from independence). Second-order differences reveal more
		fundamental changes than first-order differences across
		heterogeneous patterns.
