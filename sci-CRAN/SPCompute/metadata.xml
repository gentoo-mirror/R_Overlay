		Compute Power or Sample Size for GWAS with Covariate Effect //
		Fast computation of the required sample size or the achieved
		power, for GWAS studies with different types of covariate
		effects and different types of covariate-gene dependency
		structure. For the detailed description of the methodology, see
		Zhang (2022) "Power and Sample Size Computation for Genetic
		Association Studies of Binary Traits: Accounting for Covariate
		Effects" arXiv:2203.15641.
