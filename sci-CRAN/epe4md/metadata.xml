		EPE's 4MD Model to Forecast the Adoption of Distributed
		Generation // EPE's (Empresa de Pesquisa Energtica) 4MD (Modelo
		de Mercado da Micro e Minigerao Distribuda - Micro and Mini
		Distributed Generation Market Model) model to forecast the
		adoption of Distributed Generation. Given the user's
		assumptions, it is possible to estimate how many consumer units
		will have distributed generation in Brazil over the next 10
		years, for example. In addition, it is possible to estimate the
		installed capacity, the amount of investments that will be made
		in the country and the monthly energy contribution of this type
		of generation. https://www.epe.gov.br/sites-pt/publicacoes-
