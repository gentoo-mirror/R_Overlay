		Integrated Discovery of Oncogenic Signatures // A method to
		integrate molecular profiles of cancer patients (gene copy
		number and mRNA abundance) to identify candidate gain of
		function alterations. These candidate alterations can be
		subsequently further tested to discover cancer driver
		alterations. Briefly, this method tests of genomic correlates
		of mRNA dysregulation and prioritise those where DNA
		gains/amplifications are associated with elevated mRNA
		expression of the same gene. For details see, Haider S et al.
		(2016) "Genomic alterations underlie a pan-cancer metabolic
		shift associated with tumour hypoxia", Genome Biology,
