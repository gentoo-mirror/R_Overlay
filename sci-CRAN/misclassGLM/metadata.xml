		Computation of Generalized Linear Models with Misclassified
		Covariates Using Side Information // Estimates models that
		extend the standard GLM to take misclassification into account.
		The models require side information from a secondary data set
		on the misclassification process, i.e. some sort of
		misclassification probabilities conditional on some common
		covariates. A detailed description of the algorithm can be
		found in Dlugosz, Mammen and Wilke (2015)

		regression-with-misclassified-data-and-an-application-to-
		labour-market-transitions.
