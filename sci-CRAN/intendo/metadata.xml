		A Group of Fun Datasets of Various Sizes and Differing Levels of
		Quality // Four datasets are provided here from the 'Intendo'
		game 'Super Jetroid'. It is data from the 2015 year of
		operation and it comprises a revenue table ('all_revenue'), a
		daily users table ('users_daily'), a user summary table
		('user_summary'), and a table with data on all user sessions
		('all_sessions'). These core datasets come in different sizes,
		and, each of them has a variant that was intentionally made
		faulty (totally riddled with errors and inconsistencies). This
		suite of tables is useful for testing with packages that focus
		on data validation and data documentation.
