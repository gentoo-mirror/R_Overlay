		Best-Fit Straight Line // Provides the solution from York (1968)
		doi:10.1016/S0012-821X(68)80059-7 for fitting a straight line
		to bivariate data with errors in both coordinates. It gives
		unbiased estimates of the intercept, slope and standard errors
		of the best-fit straight line to independent points with
		(possibly correlated) normally distributed errors in both x and
		y. Other commonly used errors-in-variables methods, such as
		orthogonal distance regression, geometric mean regression or
		Deming regression are special cases of Yorks solution.
