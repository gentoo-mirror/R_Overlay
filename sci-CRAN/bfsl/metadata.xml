		Best-Fit Straight Line // How to fit a straight line through a
		set of points with errors in both coordinates? The 'bfsl'
		package implements the York regression (York, 2004
		doi:10.1119/1.1632486). It provides unbiased estimates of the
		intercept, slope and standard errors for the best-fit straight
		line to independent points with (possibly correlated) normally
		distributed errors in both x and y. Other commonly used errors-
		in-variables methods, such as orthogonal distance regression,
		geometric mean regression or Deming regression are special
		cases of the 'bfsl' solution.
