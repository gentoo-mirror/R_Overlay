		SEM Model Comparison with K-Fold Cross-Validation // The goal of
		'cvsem' is to provide functions that allow for comparing
		Structural Equation Models (SEM) using cross-validation. Users
		can specify multiple SEMs using 'lavaan' syntax. 'cvsem'
		computes the Kullback Leibler (KL) Divergence between 1) the
		model implied covariance matrix estimated from the training
		data and 2) the sample covariance matrix estimated from the
		test data described in Cudeck, Robert  Browne (1983)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v048.i02. The KL Divergence is computed for
		each of the specified SEMs allowing for the models to be
		compared based on their prediction errors.
