		Research Outputs // Assists researchers and output checkers by
		distinguishing between research output that is safe to publish,
		output that requires further analysis, and output that cannot
		be published because of substantial disclosure risk. A paper
		about the tool was presented at the UNECE Expert Meeting on
		Statistical Data Confidentiality 2023; see https://uwe-
		repository.worktribe.com/output/11060964.
