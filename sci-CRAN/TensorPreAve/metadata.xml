		Rank and Factor Loadings Estimation in Time Series Tensor Factor
		Models // A set of functions to estimate rank and factor
		loadings of time series tensor factor models. A tensor is a
		multidimensional array. To analyze high-dimensional tensor time
		series, factor model is a major dimension reduction tool.
		'TensorPreAve' provides functions to estimate the rank of core
		tensors and factor loading spaces of tensor time series. More
		specifically, a pre-averaging method that accumulates
		information from tensor fibres is used to estimate the factor
		loading spaces. The estimated directions corresponding to the
		strongest factors are then used for projecting the data for a
		potentially improved re-estimation of the factor loading spaces
		themselves. A new rank estimation method is also implemented to
		utilizes correlation information from the projected data. See
		Chen and Lam (2023) arXiv:2208.04012 for more details.
