		Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations // When building
		complex models, it is often difficult to explain why the model
		should be trusted. While global measures such as accuracy are
		useful, they cannot be used for explaining why a model made a
		specific prediction. 'lime' (a port of the 'lime' 'Python'
		package) is a method for explaining the outcome of black box
		models by fitting a local model around the point in question an
		perturbations of this point. The approach is described in more
		detail in the article by Ribeiro et al. (2016)
		arXiv:1602.04938.
