		Compute Expected Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Average YLL //
		Compute the standard expected years of life lost (YLL), as
		developed by the Global Burden of Disease Study (Murray, C.J.,
		Lopez, A.D. and World Health Organization, 1996). The YLL is
		based on comparing the age of death to an external standard
		life expectancy curve. It also computes the average YLL, which
		highlights premature causes of death and brings attention to
		preventable deaths (Aragon et al., 2008).
