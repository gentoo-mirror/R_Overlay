		Bayesian Mixing Models in R // Creates and runs Bayesian mixing
		models to analyze biological tracer data (i.e. stable isotopes,
		fatty acids), which estimate the proportions of source (prey)
		contributions to a mixture (consumer). 'MixSIAR' is not one
		model, but a framework that allows a user to create a mixing
		model based on their data structure and research questions, via
		options for fixed/ random effects, source data types, priors,
		and error terms. 'MixSIAR' incorporates several years of
		advances since 'MixSIR' and 'SIAR', and includes both GUI
		(graphical user interface) and script versions.
