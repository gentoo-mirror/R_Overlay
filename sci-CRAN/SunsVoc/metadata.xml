		Constructing Suns-Voc from Outdoor Time-Series I-V Curves //
		Suns-Voc (or Isc-Voc) curves can provide the current-voltage
		(I-V) characteristics of the diode of photovoltaic cells
		without the effect of series resistance. Here, Suns-Voc curves
		can be constructed with outdoor time-series I-V curves [1,2,3]
		of full-size photovoltaic (PV) modules instead of having to be
		measured in the lab. Time series of four different power loss
		modes can be calculated based on obtained Suns-Voc curves. This
		material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of
		Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
		(EERE) under Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) Agreement
		Number DE-EE0008172. Jennifer L. Braid is supported by the U.S.
		Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and
		Renewable Energy administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for
		Science and Education (ORISE) for the DOE. ORISE is managed by
		Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) under DOE contract
		number DE-SC0014664. [1] Wang, M. et al, 2018.
