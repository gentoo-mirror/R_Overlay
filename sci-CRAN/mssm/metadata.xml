		Multivariate State Space Models // Provides methods to perform
		parameter estimation and make analysis of multivariate observed
		outcomes through time which depends on a latent state variable.
		All methods scale well in the dimension of the observed
		outcomes at each time point. The package contains an
		implementation of a Laplace approximation, particle filters
		like suggested by Lin, Zhang, Cheng,  Chen (2005)
		doi:10.1198/016214505000000349, and the gradient and observed
		information matrix approximation suggested by Poyiadjis,
		Doucet,  Singh (2011) doi:10.1093/biomet/asq062.
