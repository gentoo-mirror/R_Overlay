		Interface to 'gretlcli' // An interface to 'GNU gretl': running
		'gretl' scripts from, estimating econometric models with
		backward passing of model results, opening 'gretl' data files
		(.gdt). 'gretl' can be downloaded from
		http://gretl.sourceforge.net. This package could make life on
		introductory/intermediate econometrics courses much easier:
		full battery of the required regression diagnostics,
		including White's heteroskedasticity test, restricted ols
		estimation,   advanced weak instrument test after iv
		estimation, very convenient dealing with lagged variables in
		models,   standard case treatment in unit root tests,   vector
		auto- regressions, and vector error correction  models.
		Datasets for   8 popular econometrics textbooks can be
		installed into 'gretl' from its server. All datasets can be
		easily imported using this package.
