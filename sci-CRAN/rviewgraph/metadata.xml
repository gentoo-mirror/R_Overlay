		Animated Graph Layout Viewer // This is an 'R' interface to Alun
		Thomas's 'ViewGraph' 'Java' graph viewing program. It takes a
		graph specified as an incidence matrix, list of edges, or in
		'igraph' format and runs a graphical user interface that shows
		an animation of a force directed algorithm positioning the
		vertices in two dimensions. It works well for graphs of various
		structure of up to a few thousand vertices. It's not fazed by
		graphs that comprise several components. The coordinates can be
		read as an 'igraph' style layout matrix at any time. The user
		can mess with the layout using a mouse, preferably one with 3
		buttons, and some keyed commands.
