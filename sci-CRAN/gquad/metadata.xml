		Prediction of G Quadruplexes and Other Non-B DNA Motifs //
		Genomic biology is not limited to the confines of the canonical
		B-forming DNA duplex, but includes over ten different types of
		other secondary structures that are collectively termed non-B
		DNA structures. Of these non-B DNA structures, the
		G-quadruplexes are highly stable four-stranded structures that
		are recognized by distinct subsets of nuclear factors. This
		package provide functions for predicting intramolecular G
		quadruplexes. In addition, functions for predicting other
		intramolecular nonB DNA structures are included.
