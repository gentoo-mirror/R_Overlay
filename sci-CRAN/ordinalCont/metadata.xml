		Ordinal Regression Analysis for Continuous Scales // A regression
		framework for response variables which are continuous self-
		rating scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in
		pain assessment, or the Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA)
		scales in quality of life studies. These scales measure
		subjects' perception of an intangible quantity, and cannot be
		handled as ratio variables because of their inherent non-
		linearity. We treat them as ordinal variables, measured on a
		continuous scale. A function (the g function) connects the
		scale with an underlying continuous latent variable. The link
		function is the inverse of the CDF of the assumed underlying
		distribution of the latent variable. A variety of link
		functions are currently implemented.
