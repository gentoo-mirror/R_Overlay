		Ordinal Regression Analysis for Continuous Scales // A regression
		framework for response variables which are continuous self-
		rating scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in
		pain assessment, or the Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA)
		scales in quality of life studies. These scales measure
		subjects' perception of an intangible quantity, and cannot be
		handled as ratio variables because of their inherent non-
		linearity. We treat them as ordinal variables, measured on a
		continuous scale. A function (the g function) connects the
		scale with an underlying continuous latent variable. The link
		function is the inverse of the CDF of the assumed underlying
		distribution of the latent variable. Currently the logit link,
		which corresponds to a standard logistic distribution, is
		implemented.
