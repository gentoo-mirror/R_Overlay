		Analysis of Ecological Dynamic Regimes // A toolbox for
		implementing the Ecological Dynamic Regime framework (Snchez-
		Pinillos et al., 2023 doi:10.1002/ecm.1589) to characterize and
		compare groups of ecological trajectories in multidimensional
		spaces defined by state variables. The package includes the
		RETRA-EDR algorithm to identify representative trajectories,
		functions to generate, summarize, and visualize representative
		trajectories, and several metrics to quantify the distribution
		and heterogeneity of trajectories in an ecological dynamic
		regime and quantify the dissimilarity between two or more
		ecological dynamic regimes. The package also includes a set of
		functions to assess ecological resilience based on ecological
		dynamic regimes (Snchez-Pinillos et al., 2024
		doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110409).
