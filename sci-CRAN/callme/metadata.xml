		Easily Compile and Call Inline C Functions // Compile inline 'C'
		code and easily call with automatically generated wrapper
		functions.  By allowing user-defined headers and compilation
		flags (preprocessor, compiler and linking flags) the user can
		configure optimization options and linking to third party
		libraries. Multiple functions may be defined in a single block
		of code - which may be defined in a string or a path to a
		source file.
