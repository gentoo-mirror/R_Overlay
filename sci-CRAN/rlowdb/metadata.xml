		Lightweight JSON-Based Database // The goal of 'rlowdb' is to
		provide a lightweight, file-based JSON database. Inspired by
		'LowDB' in 'JavaScript', it generates an intuitive interface
		for storing, retrieving, updating, and querying structured data
		without requiring a full-fledged database system. Ideal for
		prototyping, small-scale applications, and lightweight data
		management needs.
