		Predict Antimicrobial Peptides // A toolkit to predict
		antimicrobial peptides from protein sequences on a genome-wide
		scale. It incorporates two support vector machine models
		("precursor" and "mature") trained on publicly available
		antimicrobial peptide data using calculated physico-chemical
		and compositional sequence properties described in Meher et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1038/srep42362. In order to support genome-wide
		analyses, these models are designed to accept any type of
		protein as input and calculation of compositional properties
		has been optimised for high-throughput use. For details see
		Fingerhut et al. 2020 doi:10.1101/2020.05.07.082412.
