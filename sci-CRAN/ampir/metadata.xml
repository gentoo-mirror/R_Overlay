		Predict Antimicrobial Peptides // A toolkit to predict
		antimicrobial peptides from protein sequences on a genome-wide
		scale. It incorporates two support vector machine models
		("precursor" and "mature") trained on publicly available
		antimicrobial peptide data using calculated physico-chemical
		and compositional sequence properties described in Meher et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1038/srep42362. In order to support genome-wide
		analyses, these models are designed to accept any type of
		protein as input and calculation of compositional properties
		has been optimised for high-throughput use. For best results it
		is important to select the model that accurately represents
		your sequence type: for full length proteins, it is recommended
		to use the default "precursor" model. The alternative,
		"mature", model is best suited for mature peptide sequences
		that represent the final antimicrobial peptide sequence after
		post-translational processing. For details see Fingerhut et al.
		(2020) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa653. The 'ampir' package
		is also available via a Shiny based GUI at
		https://ampir.marine-omics.net/.
