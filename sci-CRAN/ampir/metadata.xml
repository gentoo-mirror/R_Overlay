		Predict Antimicrobial Peptides // A toolkit to predict
		antimicrobial peptides from protein sequences on a genome-wide
		scale. It incorporates a support vector machine model trained
		on publicly available antimicrobial peptide data using
		calculated physico-chemical and compositional sequence
		properties described in Meher et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1038/srep42362. In order to support genome-wide analyses
		this model is designed to accept any type of protein as input
		and calculation of compositional properties has been optimised
		for high-throughput use.
