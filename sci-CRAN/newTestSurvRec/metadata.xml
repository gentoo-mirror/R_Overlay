		Statistical Tests to Compare Curves with Recurrent Events //
		Implements the routines to compare the survival curves with
		recurrent events, including the estimations of survival curves.
		The first model is a  model for recurrent event, when the data
		are correlated or not  correlated. It was proposed by Wang and
		Chang (1999) doi:10.2307/2669690. In the independent case, the
		survival function can be  estimated by the generalization of
		the limit product model of Pena (2001)
		doi:10.1198/016214501753381922.
