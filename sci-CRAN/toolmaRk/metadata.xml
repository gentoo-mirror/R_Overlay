		Tests for Same-Source of Toolmarks // Implements two tests for
		same-source of toolmarks. The chumbley_non_random() test
		follows the paper "An Improved Version of a Tool Mark
		Comparison Algorithm" by Hadler and Morris (2017)
		doi:10.1111/1556-4029.13640. This is an extension of the
		Chumbley score as previously described in "Validation of Tool
		Mark Comparisons Obtained Using a Quantitative, Comparative,
		Statistical Algorithm" by Chumbley et al (2010)
		doi:10.1111/j.1556-4029.2010.01424.x. fixed_width_no_modeling()
		is based on correlation measures in a diamond shaped area of
		the toolmark as described in Hadler (2017).
