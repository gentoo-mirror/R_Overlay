		Semi-Supervised Generalized Structural Equation Modeling //
		Conducts a semi-gSEM statistical analysis (semi-supervised
		generalized structural equation modeling) on a data frame of
		coincident observations of multiple predictive or intermediate
		variables and a final continuous, outcome variable, via two
		functions sgSEMp1() and sgSEMp2(), representing fittings based
		on two statistical principles. Principle 1 determines all
		sensible univariate relationships in the spirit of the
		Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of
		variables, including predictors and the final outcome variable,
		is determined with the Markovian property that the value of the
		current predictor is sufficient in relating to the next level
		variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific
		value of the preceding-level variables to the current
		predictor, given the current value. Principle 2 resembles the
		multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors
		are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship
		of the first-level predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc)
		to the outcome variable (such as, module degradation or
		yellowing)  is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each
		significant intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome
		variable and the other variables (except the final outcome
		variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level
		multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This
		fitting process is continued until all sensible models are
		investigated.
