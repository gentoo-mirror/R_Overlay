		Multi-Horizon Electricity Demand Forecasting in High Resolution
		// Advanced forecasting algorithms for long-term energy demand
		at the national or regional level. The methodology is based on
		Grandn et al. (2024) doi:10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122249;
		Zimmermann  Ziel (2024) doi:10.2139/ssrn.4823013. Real-time
		data, including power demand, weather conditions, and
		macroeconomic indicators, are provided through automated API
		integration with various institutions. The modular approach
		maintains transparency on the various model selection processes
		and encompasses the ability to be adapted to individual needs.
		'oRaklE' tries to help facilitating robust decision-making in
		energy management and planning.
