		Network Meta-Analysis Combining Survival and Count Outcomes //
		Network meta-analysis for survival outcome data often involves
		several studies only involve dichotomized outcomes (e.g., the
		numbers of event and sample sizes of individual arms).  To
		combine these different outcome data, Woods et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1186/1471-2288-10-54 proposed a Bayesian approach using
		complicated hierarchical models. Besides, frequentist
		approaches have been alternative standard methods for the
		statistical analyses of network meta-analysis, and the
		methodology has been well established. We proposed an easy-to-
		implement method for the network meta-analysis based on the
		frequentist framework in Noma and Maruo (2025)
		doi:10.1101/2025.01.23.25321051. This package involves some
		convenient functions to implement the simple synthesis method.
