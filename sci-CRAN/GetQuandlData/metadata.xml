		Fast and Cached Import of Data from 'Quandl' Using the 'json API'
		// Imports time series data from the 'Quandl' database
		https://www.quandl.com. The package uses the  'json api' at
		https://www.quandl.com/tools/api, local caching ('memoise'
		package) and the tidy format by default. Also allows queries of
		databases, allowing the user to see which time series are
		available for each database id. In short, it is an alternative
		to package 'Quandl', with faster data importation in the
		tidy/long format.
