		Recursive Non-Additive Emulator for Multi-Fidelity Data //
		Performs RNA emulation and active learning proposed by Heo and
		Sung (2025) doi:10.1080/00401706.2024.2376173 for multi-
		fidelity computer experiments. The RNA emulator is particularly
		useful when the simulations with different fidelity level are
		nonlinearly correlated. The hyperparameters in the model are
		estimated by maximum likelihood estimation.
