		Recursive Non-Additive Emulator for Multi-Fidelity Data //
		Performs RNA emulation and active learning proposed by Heo and
		Sung (2023+) arXiv:2309.11772 for multi-fidelity computer
		experiments. The RNA emulator is particularly useful when the
		simulations with different fidelity level are nonlinearly
		correlated. The hyperparameters in the model are estimated by
		maximum likelihood estimation.
