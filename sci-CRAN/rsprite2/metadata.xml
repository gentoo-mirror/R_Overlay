		Identify Distributions that Match Reported Sample Parameters
		(SPRITE) // The SPRITE algorithm creates possible distributions
		of discrete responses based on reported sample parameters, such
		as mean, standard deviation and range (Heathers et al., 2018,
		doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.26968v1). This package implements
		it, drawing heavily on the code for Nick Brown's 'rSPRITE'
		Shiny app http://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/sprite/. In addition, it
		supports the modeling of distributions based on multi-item
		(Likert-type) scales and the use of restrictions on the
		frequency of particular responses.
