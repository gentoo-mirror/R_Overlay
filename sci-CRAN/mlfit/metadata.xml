		Iterative Proportional Fitting Algorithms for Nested Structures
		// The Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) algorithm operates
		on count data. This package offers implementations for several
		algorithms that extend this to nested structures: 'parent' and
		'child' items for both of which constraints can be provided.
		The fitting algorithms include Iterative Proportional Updating

		methods is also provided such as 'Truncate, replicate, sample'
