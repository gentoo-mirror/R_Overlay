		Statistical Evaluation of UMAP Dimensionality Reductions // A
		metric expressing the quality of a UMAP layout. This is a
		package that contains the Saturn_coefficient() function that
		reads an input matrix, its dimensionality reduction produced by
		UMAP, and evaluates the quality of this dimensionality
		reduction by producing a real value in the [0; 1] interval. We
		call this real value Saturn coefficient. A higher value means
		better dimensionality reduction; a lower value means worse
		dimensionality reduction. Reference: Davide Chicco et al. "The
		Saturn coefficient for evaluating the quality of UMAP
		dimensionality reduction results" (2025, in preparation).
