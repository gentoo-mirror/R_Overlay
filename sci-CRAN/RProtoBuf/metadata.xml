		R Interface to the 'Protocol Buffers' 'API' (Version 2 or 3) //
		Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an
		efficient yet extensible format. Google uses Protocol Buffers
		for almost all of its internal 'RPC' protocols and file
		formats.  Additional documentation is available in two included
		vignettes one of which corresponds to our 'JSS' paper (2016,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v071.i02. Either version 2 or 3 of the
		'Protocol Buffers' 'API' is supported.
