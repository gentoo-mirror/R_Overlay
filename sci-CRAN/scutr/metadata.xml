		Balancing Multiclass Datasets for Classification Tasks //
		Imbalanced training datasets impede many popular classifiers.
		To balance training data, a combination of oversampling
		minority classes and undersampling majority classes is useful.
		This package implements the SCUT (SMOTE and Cluster-based
		Undersampling Technique) algorithm as described in Agrawal et.
		al. (2015) doi:10.5220/0005595502260234. Their paper uses
		model-based clustering and synthetic oversampling to balance
		multiclass training datasets, although other resampling methods
		are provided in this package.
