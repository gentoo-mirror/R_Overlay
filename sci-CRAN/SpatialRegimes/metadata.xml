		Spatial Constrained Clusterwise Regression // A collection of
		functions for estimating spatial regimes, aggregations of
		neighboring spatial units that are homogeneous in functional
		terms. The term spatial regime, therefore, should not be
		understood as a synonym for cluster. More precisely, the term
		cluster does not presuppose any functional relationship between
		the variables considered, while the term regime is linked to a
		regressive relationship underlying the spatial process.
