		Estimators of Multiple-Site Dissimilarity Indices for the
		Assessment of Beta Diversity // Implement the multiple-site
		dissimilarity indices of Simpson, Sorensen and nestedness,
		which can be used to assess the beta diversity of a population.
		These indices were adapted from those developed by Baselga
		(2010) doi:10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00490.x in order to have
		them population size-independent. All the details behind the
		calculation and estimation of these adapted indices can be
		found in Fortin et al. (2020) doi:10.1111/geb.13080.
