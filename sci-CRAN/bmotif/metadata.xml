		Motif Analyses of Bipartite Networks // Counts occurrences of
		motifs in bipartite networks, as well as the number of times
		each node or link appears in each unique position within
		motifs. Has support for both binary and weighted motifs: can
		calculate the mean weight of motifs and the standard deviation
		of their mean weights. Intended for use in ecology, but its
		methods are general and can be applied to any bipartite
		network.
