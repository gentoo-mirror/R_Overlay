		Robust Multivariate Outlier Detection // Detection of
		multivariate outliers using robust estimates of location and
		scale. The Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator is
		used to calculate robust estimates of the mean vector and
		covariance matrix. Outliers are determined based on robust
		Mahalanobis distances using either an unstructured covariance
		matrix, a principal components structured covariance matrix, or
		a factor analysis structured covariance matrix. Includes
		options for specifying the direction of interest for outlier
		detection for each variable.
