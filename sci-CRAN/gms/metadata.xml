		'GAMS' Modularization Support Package // A collection of tools to
		create, use and maintain modularized model code written in the
		modeling language 'GAMS' (https://www.gams.com/). Out-of-the-
		box 'GAMS' does not come with support for modularized model
		code. This package provides the tools necessary to convert a
		standard 'GAMS' model to a modularized one by introducing a
		modularized code structure together with a naming convention
		which emulates local environments. In addition, this package
		provides tools to monitor the compliance of the model code with
		modular coding guidelines.
