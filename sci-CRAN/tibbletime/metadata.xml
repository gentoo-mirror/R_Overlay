		Time Aware Tibbles // Built on top of the 'tibble' package,
		'tibbletime' is an extension that allows for the creation of
		time aware tibbles. Some immediate advantages of this include:
		the ability to perform time-based subsetting on tibbles,
		quickly summarising and aggregating results by time periods,
		and creating columns that can be used as 'dplyr' time-based
		groups.
