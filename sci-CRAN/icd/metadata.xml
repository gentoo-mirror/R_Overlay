		Comorbidities // Calculate comorbidities, Charlson scores,
		perform fast and accurate validation, conversion, manipulation,
		filtering and comparison of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Common
		ambiguities and code formats are handled. This package enables
		a work flow from raw lists of ICD codes in hospital billing
		databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 and ICD-10 comorbidity
		mappings from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser
		and AHRQ included. This package replaces 'icd9', which should
		be uninstalled.
