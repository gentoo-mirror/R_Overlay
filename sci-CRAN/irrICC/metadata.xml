		Intraclass Correlations for Quantifying Inter-Rater Reliability
		// Calculates various intraclass correlation coefficients used
		to quantify inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.  The
		assumption here is that the raters produced quantitative
		ratings. Most of the statistical procedures implemented in this
		package are described in details in Gwet, K.L. (2014,
		ISBN:978-0970806284): "Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability,"
		4th edition, Advanced Analytics, LLC.
