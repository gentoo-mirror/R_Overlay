		Turn Images into Data Sets // The goal of 'image2data' is to
		extract images and return them into a data set, especially for
		teaching data manipulation and data visualization. Basically,
		the eponymous function takes an image file ('png', 'tiff',
		'jpeg', 'bmp') and turn it into a data set, pixels being rows
		(subjects) and columns (variables) being their coordinate
		positions (x- and y-axis) and their respective color (in hex
		codes). The function can return a complete image or a range of
		color (i.e., contour, silhouette). The data can then be
		manipulated as would any data set by either creating other
		related variables (to hide the image) or as a genuine toy data
		set.
