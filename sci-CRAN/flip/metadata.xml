		Multivariate Permutation Tests // It implements many univariate
		and multivariate permutation (and rotation) tests. Allowed
		tests: the t one and two samples, ANOVA, linear models, Chi
		Squared test, rank tests (i.e. Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-
		Wallis), Sign test and Mc Nemar. Test on Linear Models are
		performed also in presence of covariates (i.e. nuisance
		parameters). The permutation and the rotation methods to get
		the null distribution of the test statistics are available. It
		also implements methods for multiplicity control such as
		Westfall  Young minP procedure and Closed Testing (Marcus,
		1976) and k-FWER. Moreover, it allows to test for fixed effects
		in mixed effects models.
