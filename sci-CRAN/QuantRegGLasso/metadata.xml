		Adaptively Weighted Group Lasso for Semiparametric Quantile
		Regression Models // Implements an adaptively weighted group
		Lasso procedure for simultaneous variable selection and
		structure identification in varying coefficient quantile
		regression models and additive quantile regression models with
		ultra-high dimensional covariates. The methodology, grounded in
		a strong sparsity condition, establishes selection consistency
		under certain weight conditions. To address the challenge of
		tuning parameter selection in practice, a BIC-type criterion
		named high-dimensional information criterion (HDIC) is
		proposed. The Lasso procedure, guided by HDIC-determined tuning
		parameters, maintains selection consistency. Theoretical
		findings are strongly supported by simulation studies. (Toshio
