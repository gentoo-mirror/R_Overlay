		Detection Localization Mapping for QTL // QTL mapping in a mixed
		model framework with separate detection and localization
		stages. The first stage detects the number of QTL on each
		chromosome based on the genetic variation due to grouped
		markers on the chromosome; the second stage uses this
		information to determine the most likely QTL positions. The
		mixed model can accommodate general fixed and random effects,
		including spatial effects in field trials and pedigree effects.
		Applicable to backcrosses, doubled haploids, recombinant inbred
		lines, F2 intercrosses, and association mapping populations.
