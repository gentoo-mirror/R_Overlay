		Controlled Difference Estimation for Complex Surveys // Estimates
		the population average controlled difference for a given
		outcome between levels of a binary treatment, exposure, or
		other group membership variable of interest for clustered,
		stratified survey samples where sample selection depends on the
		comparison group. Provides three methods for estimation, namely
		outcome modeling and two factorizations of inverse probability
		weighting. Under stronger assumptions, these methods estimate
		the causal population average treatment effect. Salerno et al.,
