		Estimate the Effective Reproductive Number with Trend Filtering
		// Use trend filtering, a type of regularized nonparametric
		regression, to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number,
		also called Rt. This value roughly says how many new infections
		will result from each new infection today.  Values larger than
		1 indicate that an epidemic is growing while those less than 1
		indicate decline. For more details about this methodology, see
		Liu, Cai, Gustafson, and McDonald (2024)
