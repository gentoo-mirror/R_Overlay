		Iterative Extrapolation of Species' Haplotype Accumulation Curves
		for Genetic Diversity Assessment // Performs iterative
		extrapolation of species' haplotype accumulation curves using a
		nonparametric stochastic (Monte Carlo) optimization method for
		assessment of specimen sampling completeness based on the
		approach of Phillips et al. (2015) doi:10.1515/dna-2015-0008,
		Phillips et al. (2019) doi:10.1002/ece3.4757 and Phillips et
		al. (2020) doi: 10.7717/peerj-cs.243. 'HACSim' outputs a number
		of useful summary statistics of sampling coverage ("Measures of
		Sampling Closeness"), including an estimate of the likely
		required sample size (along with desired level confidence
		intervals) necessary to recover a given number/proportion of
		observed unique species' haplotypes. Any genomic marker can be
		targeted to assess likely required specimen sample sizes for
		genetic diversity assessment. The method is particularly well-
		suited to assess sampling sufficiency for DNA barcoding
		initiatives. Users can also simulate their own DNA sequences
		according to various models of nucleotide substitution. A Shiny
		app is also available.
