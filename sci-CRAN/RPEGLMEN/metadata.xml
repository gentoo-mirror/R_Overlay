		Gamma and Exponential Generalized Linear Models with Elastic Net
		Penalty // Implements the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding
		algorithm (FISTA) algorithm to fit a Gamma distribution with an
		elastic net penalty as described in Chen, Arakvin and Martin
		(2018) arxiv:1804.07780. An implementation for the case of the
		exponential distribution is also available, with details
		available in Chen and Martin (2018)
