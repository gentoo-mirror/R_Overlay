		An Arsenal of 'R' Functions for Large-Scale Statistical Summaries
		// An Arsenal of 'R' functions for large-scale statistical
		summaries, which are streamlined to work within the latest
		reporting tools in 'R' and 'RStudio' and which use formulas and
		versatile summary statistics for summary tables and models. The
		primary functions include tableby(), a Table-1-like summary of
		multiple variable types 'by' the levels of a categorical
		variable; modelsum(), which performs simple model fits on the
		same endpoint for many variables (univariate or adjusted for
		standard covariates); freqlist(), a powerful frequency table
		across many categorical variables; compare.data.frame(), the S3
		method for comparing data.frames; and write2(), a function to
		output tables to a document.
