		Distribution Fitting with Calibrating Priors for Commonly Used
		Distributions // Generates predictive distributions based on
		calibrating priors for various commonly used statistical
		models, including models with predictors. Routines for
		densities, probabilities, quantiles, random deviates and the
		parameter posterior are provided. The predictions are generated
		from the Bayesian prediction integral, with priors chosen to
		give good reliability (also known as calibration). For
		homogeneous models, the prior is set to the right Haar prior,
		giving predictions which are exactly reliable. As a result, in
		repeated testing, the frequencies of out-of-sample outcomes and
		the probabilities from the predictions agree. For other models,
		the prior is chosen to give good reliability. Where possible,
		the Bayesian prediction integral is solved exactly. Where exact
		solutions are not possible, the Bayesian prediction integral is
		solved using the Datta-Mukerjee-Ghosh-Sweeting (DMGS)
		asymptotic expansion. Optionally, the prediction integral can
		also be solved using posterior samples generated using Paul
		Northrop's ratio of uniforms sampling package ('rust'). Results
		are also generated based on maximum likelihood, for comparison
		purposes. Various model selection diagnostics and testing
		routines are included. Based on "Reducing reliability bias in
		assessments of extreme weather risk using calibrating priors",
