		Four-Step Biodiversity Analysis Based on 'iNEXT' // Expands
		'iNEXT' to include the estimation of sample completeness and
		evenness. The package provides simple functions to perform the
		following four-step biodiversity analysis: STEP 1: Assessment
		of sample completeness profiles. STEP 2a: Analysis of size-
		based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves to
		determine whether the asymptotic diversity can be accurately
		estimated. STEP 2b: Comparison of the observed and the
		estimated asymptotic diversity profiles. STEP 3: Analysis of
		non-asymptotic coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation
		sampling curves. STEP 4: Assessment of evenness profiles. The
		analyses in STEPs 2a, 2b and STEP 3 are mainly based on the
		previous 'iNEXT' package. Refer to the 'iNEXT' package for
		details. This package is mainly focusing on the computation for
		STEPs 1 and 4. See Chao et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1111/1440-1703.12102 for statistical background.
