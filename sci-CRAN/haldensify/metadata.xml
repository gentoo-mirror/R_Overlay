		Highly Adaptive Lasso Conditional Density Estimation // An
		algorithm for flexible conditional density estimation based on
		application of pooled hazard regression to an artificial
		repeated measures dataset constructed by discretizing the
		support of the outcome variable. To facilitate non/semi-
		parametric estimation of the conditional density, the highly
		adaptive lasso, a nonparametric regression function shown to
		reliably estimate a large class of functions at a fast
		convergence rate, is utilized. The pooled hazards data
		augmentation formulation implemented was first described by Daz
		and van der Laan (2011) doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1356. To
		complement the conditional density estimation utilities, tools
		for efficient nonparametric inverse probability weighted (IPW)
		estimation of the causal effects of stochastic shift
		interventions (modified treatment policies), directly utilizing
		the density estimation technique for construction of the
		generalized propensity score, are provided. These IPW
		estimators utilize undersmoothing (sieve estimation) of the
		conditional density estimators in order to achieve the
		non/semi-parametric efficiency bound.
