		Highly Adaptive Lasso Conditional Density Estimation // An
		algorithm for flexible conditional density estimation based on
		application of pooled hazard regression to an artificial
		repeated measures dataset constructed by discretizing the
		support of the outcome variable. To facilitate flexible
		estimation of the conditional density, the highly adaptive
		lasso, a non-parametric regression function shown to estimate
		cadlag (RCLL) functions at a suitably fast convergence rate, is
		used. The use of pooled hazards regression for conditional
		density estimation as implemented here was first described for
		by Daz and van der Laan (2011) doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1356.
		Building on the conditional density estimation utilities, non-
		parametric inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators of the
		causal effects of additive modified treatment policies are
		implemented, using conditional density estimation to estimate
		the generalized propensity score. Non-parametric IPW estimators
		based on this can be coupled with undersmoothing of the
		generalized propensity score estimator to attain the semi-
		parametric efficiency bound (per Hejazi, Daz, and van der Laan
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2205.05777).
