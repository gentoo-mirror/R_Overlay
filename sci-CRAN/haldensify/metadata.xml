		Highly Adaptive Lasso Conditional Density Estimation //
		Conditional density estimation is a longstanding and
		challenging problem in statistical theory, and numerous
		proposals exist for optimally estimating such complex
		functions. Algorithms for nonparametric estimation of
		conditional densities based on a pooled hazard regression
		formulation and semiparametric estimation via conditional
		hazards modeling are implemented based on the highly adaptive
		lasso, a nonparametric regression function for efficient
		estimation with fast convergence under mild assumptions. The
		pooled hazards formulation implemented was first described by
		Daz and van der Laan (2011) doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1356.
