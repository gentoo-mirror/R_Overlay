		Analyze Experimental High-Throughput (Omics) Data // The
		efficient treatment and convenient analysis of experimental
		high-throughput (omics) data gets facilitated through this
		collection of diverse functions. Several functions address
		advanced object-conversions, like manipulating lists of lists
		or lists of arrays, reorganizing lists to arrays or into
		separate vectors, merging of multiple entries, etc.  Another
		set of functions provides speed-optimized calculation of
		standard deviation (sd), coefficient of variance (CV) or
		standard error of the mean (SEM) for data in matrixes or means
		per line with respect to additional grouping (eg n groups of
		replicates). Other functions facilitate dealing with non-
		redundant information, by indexing unique, adding counters to
		redundant or eliminating lines with respect redundancy in a
		given reference-column, etc. Help is provided to identify very
		closely matching numeric values to generate (partial) distance
		matrixes for very big data in a memory efficient manner or to
		reduce the complexity of large data-sets by combining very
		close values. Many times large experimental datasets need some
		additional filtering, adequate functions are provided. Batch
		reading (or writing) of sets of files and combining data to
		arrays is supported, too. Convenient data normalization is
		supported in various different modes, parameter estimation via
		permutations or boot-strap as well as flexible testing of
		multiple pair-wise combinations using the framework of 'limma'
		is provided, too.
