		Monte Carlo Option Pricing Algorithms for Jump Diffusion Models
		with Correlational Companies // Option is a one of the
		financial derivatives and its pricing is an important problem
		in practice. The process of stock prices are represented as
		Geometric Brownian motion [Black (1973) doi:10.1086/260062] or
		jump diffusion processes [Kou (2002)
		doi:10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1086.166]. In this package, algorithms
		and visualizations are implemented by Monte Carlo method in
		order to calculate European option price for three equations by
		Geometric Brownian motion and jump diffusion processes and
		furthermore a model that presents jumps among companies affect
		each other.
