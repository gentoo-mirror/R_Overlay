		Monte Carlo Option Pricing Algorithm for Jump Diffusion Models
		with Correlational Companies // Black-Scholes model [Black
		(1973) doi:10.1086/260062] is important to calculate option
		premiums in the stock market, and variety of improved models
		are studied. In this package, I propose methods in order to
		calculate both Black-Scholes model and Jump diffusion model
		[Kou (2002) doi:10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1086.166] by Monte Carlo
		methods. This package can be used for computational finance.
