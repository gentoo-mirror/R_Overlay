		Automated Transformations, Normality Testing, and Reporting //
		Automated performance of common transformations used to fulfill
		parametric assumptions of normality and identification of the
		best performing method for the user. Output for various
		normality tests (Thode, 2002) corresponding to the best
		performing method and a descriptive statistical report of the
		input data in its original units (5-number summary and
		mathematical moments) are also presented. Lastly, the Rankit,
		an empirical normal quantile transformation (ENQT) (Soloman
		Sawilowsky, 2009), is provided to accommodate non-standard use
		cases and facilitate adoption. DOI: 10.1201/9780203910894. DOI:
