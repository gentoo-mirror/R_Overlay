		Properties of Bayesian Early Gating Designs // Computes the most
		important properties of four 'Bayesian' early gating designs
		(two single arm and two randomized controlled designs), such as
		minimum required number of successes in the experimental group
		to make a GO decision, operating characteristics and average
		operating characteristics with respect to the sample size.
		These might aid in deciding what design to use for the early
		phase trial.
