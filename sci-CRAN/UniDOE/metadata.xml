		Uniform Design of Experiments // Efficient procedures for
		constructing uniform design of experiments under various space-
		filling criteria. It is based on a stochastic and adaptive
		threshold accepting algorithm with flexible initialization,
		adaptive threshold, and stochastic evolution. The package may
		also construct the augmented uniform designs in a sequential
		manner. View details at: Zhang, A. and Li, H. (2017). UniDOE:
		An R package for constructing uniform design of experiments via
		stochastic and adaptive threshold accepting algorithm.
