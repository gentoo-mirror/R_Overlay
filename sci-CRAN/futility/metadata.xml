		Interim Analysis of Operational Futility in Randomized Trials
		with Time-to-Event Endpoints and Fixed Follow-Up // Randomized
		clinical trials commonly follow participants for a time-to-
		event efficacy endpoint for a fixed period of time.
		Consequently, at the time when the last enrolled participant
		completes their follow-up, the number of observed endpoints is
		a random variable. Assuming data collected through an interim
		timepoint, simulation-based estimation and inferential
		procedures in the standard right-censored failure time analysis
		framework are conducted for the distribution of the number of
		endpoints--in total as well as by treatment arm--at the end of
		the follow-up period. The future (i.e., yet unobserved)
		enrollment, endpoint, and dropout times are generated according
		to mechanisms specified in the simTrial() function in the
		'seqDesign' package. A Bayesian model for the endpoint rate is
		used for generating future data (see the vignette for details).
