		SPRE Statistics for Exploring Heterogeneity in Meta-Analysis //
		An implementation of SPRE (standardised predicted random-
		effects) statistics in R to explore heterogeneity in genetic
		association meta- analyses, as described by Magosi et al.
		(2019) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz590. SPRE statistics are
		precision weighted residuals that indicate the direction and
		extent with which individual study-effects in a meta-analysis
		deviate from the average genetic effect. Overly influential
		positive outliers have the potential to inflate average genetic
		effects in a meta-analysis whilst negative outliers might lower
		or change the direction of effect. See the 'getspres' website
		for documentation and examples
