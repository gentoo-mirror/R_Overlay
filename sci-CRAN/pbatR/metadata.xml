		Pedigree/Family-Based Genetic Association Tests Analysis and
		Power // This R package provides power calculations via
		internal simulation methods. The package also provides a
		frontend to the now abandoned PBAT program (developed by
		Christoph Lange), and reads in the corresponding output and
		displays results and figures when appropriate. The license of
		this R package itself is GPL. However, to have the program
		interact with the PBAT program for some functionality of the R
		package, users must additionally obtain the PBAT program from
		Christoph Lange, and accept his license. Both the data analysis
		and power calculations have command line and graphical
		interfaces using tcltk.
