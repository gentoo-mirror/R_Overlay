		Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solvers Written in R Using
		S4 Classes // Show physics, math and engineering students how
		an ODE solver is made and how effective R classes can be for
		the construction of the equations that describe natural
		phenomena. Inspiration for this work comes from the book on
		"Computer Simulations in Physics" by Harvey Gould, Jan
		Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian. Book link:
