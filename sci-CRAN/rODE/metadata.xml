		Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solvers Written in R Using
		S4 Classes // Show Physics and engineering students how an ODE
		solver is made and how effective classes can be for the
		construction of the equations that describe how effective
		classes can be for the construction of equations that describe
		the natural phenomena. Most of the ideas come from the book on
		"Computer Simulations in Physics" by Harvey Gould, Jan
		Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian. Book link:
