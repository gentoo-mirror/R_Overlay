		Power and Sample Size Calculations for Completely Randomized and
		Rerandomized Experiments // Computes the power resulting from
		completely randomized and rerandomized experiments with two
		groups. Furthermore, computes the sample size necessary to
		obtain a desired level of power for completely randomized and
		rerandomized experiments.
