		Multistage Record Linkage and Case Definition for Epidemiological
		Analysis // Perform multistage deterministic linkages and apply
		case definitions to datasets. Records are linked by different
		matching criteria in a specified order of certainty. The
		linkage process handles missing data and conflicting matches
		using this same order. Track events (e.g. sample collection)
		and period (e.g. hospital admission) to episodes. This process
		permits several options such as episode lengths and recurrence.
		Record linkage and episode tracking assign unique group
		identifiers to matched records. Duplicate events or records can
		then be identified or sub-analyses performed within each group.
