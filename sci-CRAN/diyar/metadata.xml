		Record Linkage and Epidemiological Case Definitions in 'R' // An
		R package for iterative and batched record linkage, and
		applying epidemiological case definitions. 'diyar' can be used
		for deterministic and probabilistic record linkage, or
		multistage record linkage combining both approaches. It
		features the implementation of nested match criteria, and
		mechanisms to address missing data and conflicting matches
		during stepwise record linkage. Case definitions are
		implemented by assigning records to groups based on match
		criteria such as person or place, and overlapping time or
		duration of events e.g. sample collection dates or periods of
		hospital stays. Matching records are assigned a unique group
		ID. Index and duplicate records are removed or further analyses
		as required.
