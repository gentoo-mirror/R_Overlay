		Multistage Record Linkage and Case Definition for Epidemiological
		Analysis // Perform multistage deterministic linkages, apply
		case definitions to datasets, and deduplicate records. Records
		(rows) from datasets are linked by different matching criteria
		and sub-criteria (columns) in a specified order of certainty.
		The linkage process handles missing data and conflicting
		matches based on this same order of certainty. For episode
		grouping, rows of dated events (e.g. sample collection) or
		interval of events (e.g. hospital admission) are grouped into
		chronological episodes beginning with a "case". The process
		permits several options such as episode lengths and recurrence
		periods which are used to build custom preferences for case
		assignment (definition). The record linkage and episode
		grouping processes assign unique group IDs to matching records
		or those grouped into episodes. This then allows for record
		deduplication or sub-analysis within these groups.
