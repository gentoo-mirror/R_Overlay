		Record Linkage and Epidemiological Case Definitions in R // An R
		package for record linkage and implementing epidemiological
		case definitions in R. Record linkage is implemented either
		through a multistage deterministic approach or a probabilistic
		approach. Matching records are assigned to unique groups. There
		are mechanisms to address missing data and conflicting matches
		across linkage stages. Track and assign events (e.g. sample
		collection) and periods (e.g. hospital admission) to unique
		groups based on a case definition. The tracking process permits
		several options such as episode lengths and recurrence.
		Duplicate events or records can then be identified for removal
		or further analyses.
