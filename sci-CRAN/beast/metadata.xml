		Bayesian Estimation of Change-Points in the Slope of Multivariate
		Time-Series // Assume that a temporal process is composed of
		contiguous segments with differing slopes and replicated noise-
		corrupted time series measurements are observed. The unknown
		mean of the data generating process is modelled as a piecewise
		linear function of time with an unknown number of change-
		points. The package infers the joint posterior distribution of
		the number and position of change-points as well as the unknown
		mean parameters per time-series by MCMC sampling. A-priori, the
		proposed model uses an overfitting number of mean parameters
		but, conditionally on a set of change-points, only a subset of
		them influences the likelihood. An exponentially decreasing
		prior distribution on the number of change-points gives rise to
		a posterior distribution concentrating on sparse
		representations of the underlying sequence, but also available
		is the Poisson distribution. See Papastamoulis et al (2017)
		arXiv:1709.06111 for a detailed presentation of the method.
