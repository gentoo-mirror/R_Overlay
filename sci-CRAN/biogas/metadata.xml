		Process Biogas Data and Predict Biogas Production // Functions
		for calculating biochemical methane potential (BMP) from
		laboratory measurements and other types of data processing and
		prediction useful for biogas research. Raw laboratory
		measurements for diverse methods (volumetric, manometric,
		gravimetric, gas density) can be processed to calculate BMP.
		Theoretical maximum BMP or methane or biogas yield can be
		predicted from various measures of substrate composition. Molar
		mass and calculated oxygen demand (COD') can be determined from
		a chemical formula. Measured gas volume can be corrected for
		water vapor and to standard (or user-defined) temperature and
		pressure. Gas quantity can be converted between volume, mass,
		and moles. A function for planning BMP experiments can consider
		multiple constraints in suggesting substrate or inoculum
		quantities, and check for problems. Inoculum and substrate mass
		can be determined for planning BMP experiments. Finally, a set
		of first-order models can be fit to measured methane production
		rate or cumulative yield in order to extract estimates of
		ultimate yield and kinetic constants. See Hafner et al. (2018)

		application that provides access to some of the package
		functionality: https://biotransformers.shinyapps.io/oba1/. The
		Standard BMP Methods website documents the calculations in
		detail: https://www.dbfz.de/en/BMP.
