		Process Biogas Data and Predict Biogas Production // High- and
		low-level functions for processing biogas data and predicting
		biogas production. Molar mass and calculated oxygen demand
		(COD') can be determined from a chemical formula. Measured gas
		volume can be corrected for water vapor and to (possibly user-
		defined) standard temperature and pressure. Gas quantity can be
		converted between volume, mass, and moles. Gas composition,
		cumulative production, or other variables can be interpolated
		to a specified time. Cumulative biogas and methane production
		(and rates) can be calculated from raw data obtained using
		volumetric, manometric, gravimetric, or gas density methods for
		any number of bottles. With cumulative methane production data
		and data on bottle contents, biochemical methane potential
		(BMP) or specific methane production (SMP) can be calculated
		and summarized, including subtraction of the inoculum
		contribution and normalization by substrate mass. Cumulative
		production and production rates can be summarized in several
		different ways (e.g., omitting normalization) using the same
		function. Biogas quantity and composition can be predicted from
		substrate composition and additional, optional data. Inoculum
		and substrate mass can be determined for planning BMP
		experiments. Finally, first-order models can be fit to
		measurements in order to extract estimates of ultimate yield
		and kinetic constants.
