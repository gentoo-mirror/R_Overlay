		Process Biogas Data and Predict Biogas Production // High- and
		low-level functions for processing biogas data and predicting
		biogas production. Molar mass and calculated oxygen demand
		(COD') can be determined from a chemical formula. Measured gas
		volume can be corrected for water vapor and to (possibly user-
		defined) standard temperature and pressure. Gas composition,
		cumulative production, or other variables can be interpolated
		to a specified time. Cumulative biogas and methane production
		(and rates) can be calculated using volumetric, manometric, or
		gravimetric methods for any number of reactors. With cumulative
		methane production data and data on reactor contents,
		biochemical methane potential (BMP) can be calculated and
		summarized, including subtraction of the inoculum contribution
		and normalization by substrate mass. Cumulative production and
		production rates can be summarized in several different ways
		(e.g., omitting normalization) using the same function. Lastly,
		biogas quantity and composition can be predicted from substrate
		composition and additional, optional data.
