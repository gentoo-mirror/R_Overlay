		Parsimonious Hidden Markov Models for Four-Way Data // Implements
		parsimonious hidden Markov models for four-way data via
		expectation- conditional maximization algorithm, as described
		in Tomarchio et al. (2020) arXiv:2107.04330. The matrix-variate
		normal distribution is used as emission distribution. For each
		hidden state, parsimony is reached via the eigen-decomposition
		of the covariance matrices of the emission distribution. This
		produces a family of 98 parsimonious hidden Markov models.
