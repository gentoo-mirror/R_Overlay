		Forward Stepwise Discriminant Analysis with Pillai's Trace // A
		novel forward stepwise discriminant analysis framework that
		integrates Pillai's trace with Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant
		Analysis (ULDA), providing an improvement over traditional
		stepwise LDA methods that rely on Wilks' Lambda. A stand-alone
		ULDA implementation is also provided, offering a more general
		solution than the one available in the 'MASS' package. It
		automatically handles missing values and provides visualization
		tools. For more details, see Wang (2024)
