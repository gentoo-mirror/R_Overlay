		Confidence Intervals Utilizing Uncertain Prior Information //
		Computes a confidence interval for a specified linear
		combination of the regression parameters in a linear regression
		model with iid normal errors with known variance when there is
		uncertain prior information that a distinct specified linear
		combination of the regression parameters takes a given value.
		This confidence interval, found by numerical constrained
		optimization, has the required minimum coverage and utilizes
		this uncertain prior information through desirable expected
		length properties. This confidence interval has the following
		three practical applications. Firstly, if the error variance
		has been accurately estimated from previous data then it may be
		treated as being effectively known. Secondly, for sufficiently
		large (dimension of the response vector) minus (dimension of
		regression parameter vector), greater than or equal to 30
		(say), if we replace the assumed known value of the error
		variance by its usual estimator in the formula for the
		confidence interval then the resulting interval has, to a very
		good approximation, the same coverage probability and expected
		length properties as when the error variance is known. Thirdly,
		some more complicated models can be approximated by the linear
		regression model with error variance known when certain unknown
		parameters are replaced by estimates. This confidence interval
		is described in Kabaila, P. and Mainzer, R. (2017)
		arXiv:1708.09543, and is a member of the family of confidence
		intervals proposed by Kabaila, P. and Giri, K. (2009)
