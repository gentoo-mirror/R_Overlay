		Joint Estimation of Latent Groups and Group-Specific Coefficients
		in Panel Data Models // Latent group structures are a common
		challenge in panel data analysis. Disregarding group-level
		heterogeneity can introduce bias. Conversely, estimating
		individual coefficients for each cross-sectional unit is
		inefficient and may lead to high uncertainty. This package
		addresses the issue of unobservable group structures by
		implementing the pairwise adaptive group fused Lasso (PAGFL) by
		Mehrabani (2023) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.12.002. PAGFL
		identifies latent group structures and group-specific
		coefficients in a single step. On top of that, we extend the
		PAGFL to time-varying coefficient functions.
