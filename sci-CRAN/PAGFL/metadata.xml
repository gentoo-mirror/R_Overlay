		Joint Estimation and Identification of Latent Groups in Panel
		Data Models // In panel data analysis, unobservable group
		structures are a common challenge. Disregarding group-level
		heterogeneity by assuming an entirely homogeneous panel can
		introduce bias. Conversely, estimating individual coefficients
		for each cross-sectional unit is inefficient and may lead to
		high uncertainty. This package addresses this issue by
		implementing the pairwise adaptive group fused Lasso (PAGFL) by
		Mehrabani (2023) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.12.002. PAGFL is an
		efficient methodology to identify latent group structures and
		estimate group-specific coefficients simultaneously.
