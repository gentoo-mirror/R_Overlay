		Sample Size for SMART Designs in Non-Surgical Periodontal Trials
		// Sample size calculation to detect dynamic treatment regime
		(DTR) effects based on change in clinical attachment level
		(CAL) outcomes from a non-surgical chronic periodontitis
		treatments study. The experiment is performed under a
		Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design.
		The clustered tooth (sub-unit) level CAL outcomes are skewed,
		spatially-referenced, and non-randomly missing. The implemented
		algorithm is available in Xu et al. (2019+) arXiv:1902.09386.
