		Metaproteomics Post-Processing Analysis // Set of tools for
		descriptive analysis of metaproteomics data generated from
		high-throughput mass spectrometry instruments. These tools
		allow to cluster peptides and proteins abundance, expressed as
		spectral counts, and to manipulate them in groups of
		metaproteins. This information can be represented using
		multiple visualization functions to portray the global
		metaproteome landscape and to differentiate samples or
		conditions, in terms of abundance of metaproteins, taxonomic
		levels and/or functional annotation. The provided tools allow
		to implement flexible analytical pipelines that can be easily
		applied to studies interested in metaproteomics analysis.
