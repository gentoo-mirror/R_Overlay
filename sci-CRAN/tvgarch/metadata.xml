		Time Varying GARCH Modelling // Simulation, estimation and
		inference for TV(s)-GARCH(p,q,r)-X models, where s indicates
		the number and shape of the transition functions, p is the ARCH
		order, q is the GARCH order, r is the asymmetry order, and 'X'
		indicates that covariates can be included. The TV long-term
		component, as in the multiplicative TV-GARCH model of Amado and
		Ter\"asvirta (2013) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.03.006,
		introduces non-stationarity in the variance process, where the
		GARCH-X short-term component describes conditional
		heteroscedasticity. Maximisation by parts leads to consistent
		and asymptotically normal estimates.
