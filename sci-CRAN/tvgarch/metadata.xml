		Time Varying GARCH Modelling // Simulation, estimation and
		inference for univariate and multivariate TV(s)-GARCH(p,q,r)-X
		models, where s indicates the number and shape of the
		transition functions, p is the ARCH order, q is the GARCH
		order, r is the asymmetry order, and 'X' indicates that
		covariates can be included; see Campos-Martins and Sucarrat
		(2024) doi:10.18637/jss.v108.i09. In the multivariate case,
		variances are estimated equation by equation and dynamic
		conditional correlations are allowed. The TV long-term
		component of the variance as in the multiplicative TV-GARCH
		model of Amado and Terasvirta (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.03.006 introduces non-stationarity
		whereas the GARCH-X short-term component describes conditional
		heteroscedasticity. Maximisation by parts leads to consistent
		and asymptotically normal estimates.
