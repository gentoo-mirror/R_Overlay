		Hidden Markov Models with Discrete Non-Parametric Observation
		Distributions // Fits hidden Markov models with discrete non-
		parametric observation distributions to data sets.  The
		observations may be univariate or bivariate. Simulates data
		from such models. Finds most probable underlying hidden states,
		the most probable sequences of such states, and the log
		likelihood of a collection of observations given the parameters
		of the model.  Auxiliary predictors are accommodated in the
		univariate setting.
