		A General Framework of Multivariate Mixed-Effects Selection
		Models // Offers a general framework of multivariate mixed-
		effects models for the joint analysis of multiple correlated
		outcomes with clustered data structures and potential
		missingness proposed by Wang et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy022. The missingness of outcome
		values may depend on the values themselves (missing not at
		random and non-ignorable), or may depend on only the covariates
		(missing at random and ignorable), or both. This package
		provides functions for two models: 1) mvMISE_b() allows
		correlated outcome-specific random intercepts with a factor-
		analytic structure, and 2) mvMISE_e() allows the correlated
		outcome-specific error terms with a graphical lasso penalty on
		the error precision matrix. Both functions are motivated by the
		multivariate data analysis on data with clustered structures
		from labelling-based quantitative proteomic studies. These
		models and functions can also be applied to univariate and
		multivariate analyses of clustered data with balanced or
		unbalanced design and no missingness.
