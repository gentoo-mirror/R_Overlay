		Datasets that Support the EDGE Server DIY Logic // Datasets from
		(Excel download)
		https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-
		Guidance/Downloads/CY2019-DIY-tables.01.17.20.xlsx and (ZIP
		download) https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-
		Guidance/Downloads/HHS-HCC-2019-software.01.17.2020.zip in a
		tidy format. These support the Centers for Medicare and
		Medicaid Services' (CMS) risk adjustment Do-It-Yourself (DIY)
		process, which allows health insurance issuers to calculate
		member risk profiles under the Health and Human Services-
		Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCC) regression model.
		This regression model is used to calculate risk adjustment
		transfers. Risk adjustment is a selection mitigation program
		implemented under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
		Act (ACA or Obamacare) in the USA. Under the ACA, health
		insurance issuers submit claims data to CMS in order for CMS to
		calculate a risk score under the HHS-HCC regression model.
		However, CMS does not inform issuers of their average risk
		score until after the data submission deadline. These data sets
		can be used by issuers to calculate their average risk score
		mid-year. More information about risk adjustment and the HHS-
		HCC model can be found here: https://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/
		A2014/MMRR2014_004_03_a03.html.
