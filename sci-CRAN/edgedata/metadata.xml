		Datasets that Support the EDGE Server DIY Logic // Datasets from
		most recent CCIIO DIY entry in a tidy format. These support the
		Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) risk
		adjustment Do-It-Yourself (DIY) process, which allows health
		insurance issuers to calculate member risk profiles under the
		Health and Human Services-Hierarchical Condition Categories
		(HHS-HCC) regression model. This regression model is used to
		calculate risk adjustment transfers. Risk adjustment is a
		selection mitigation program implemented under the Patient
		Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) in the
		USA. Under the ACA, health insurance issuers submit claims data
		to CMS    in order for CMS to calculate a risk score under the
		HHS-HCC regression model. However, CMS does not inform issuers
		of their average risk score until after the data submission
		deadline. These data sets can be used by issuers to calculate
		their average risk score mid-year. More information about risk
		adjustment and the HHS-HCC model can be found here: https://www
		.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_03_a03.html.
