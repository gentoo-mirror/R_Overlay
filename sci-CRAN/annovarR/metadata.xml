		Integrated Framework to Annotate Genetic Variants // The
		'annovarR' package provides R functions as well as database
		resources which offer an integrated framework to annotate
		genetic variants from genome and transcriptome data. The
		wrapper functions of 'annovarR' unified the interface of many
		published annotation tools, such as 'VEP'
		(http://asia.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html),
		'ANNOVAR' (http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/), 'vcfanno'
		(https://github.com/brentp/vcfanno) and 'AnnotationDbi' (http:/
		/www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationDbi.
		html). It also simplified the use of some of the external
		annotation tools in R. Besides, massive published genetic
		variants annotation databases were integrated into 'annovarR'.
		For example, 'annovarR' provides a newly RNA-seq allele
		frequency database, BRVar, which built from total 1,285 cases
		public B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
		transcriptome data.
