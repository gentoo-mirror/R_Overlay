		White Matter Normalization for Magnetic Resonance Images //
		Shinohara (2014) doi:10.1016/j.nicl.2014.08.008 introduced
		'WhiteStripe', an intensity-based normalization of T1 and T2
		images, where normal appearing white matter performs well, but
		requires segmentation. This method performs white matter mean
		and standard deviation estimates on data that has been rigidly-
		registered to the 'MNI' template and uses histogram-based
		methods.
