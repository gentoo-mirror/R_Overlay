		Stochastic Weather Generator // An adaptation of the multi-
		variable stochastic weather generator proposed in 'Rglimclim'
		to perform gap-filling and temporal extension at sub-daily
		resolution. Simulation is performed based on large scale
		variables and climatic observation data that could be generated
		from different gauged stations having geographical proximity.
		SWG relies on reanalyses. Multi-variable dependence is taking
		into account by using the decomposition of the product rule (in
		statistics) into conditional probabilities. See
