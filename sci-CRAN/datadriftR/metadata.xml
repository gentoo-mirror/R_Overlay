		Concept Drift Detection Methods for Stream Data // A system
		designed for detecting concept drift in streaming datasets. It
		offers a comprehensive suite of statistical methods to detect
		concept drift, including methods for monitoring changes in data
		distributions over time. The package supports several tests,
		such as Drift Detection Method (DDM), Early Drift Detection
		Method (EDDM), Hoeffding Drift Detection Methods (HDDM_A,
		HDDM_W), Kolmogorov-Smirnov test-based Windowing (KSWIN) and
		Page Hinkley (PH) tests. The methods implemented in this
		package are based on established research and have been
		demonstrated to be effective in real-time data analysis. For
		more details on the methods, please check to the following
