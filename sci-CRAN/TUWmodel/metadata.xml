		Lumped Hydrological Model for Education Purposes // The model,
		developed at the Vienna University of Technology, is a lumped
		conceptual rainfall-runoff model, following the structure of
		the HBV model. The model runs on a daily or shorter time step
		and consists of a snow routine, a soil moisture routine and a
		flow routing routine. See Parajka, J., R. Merz, G. Bloeschl
