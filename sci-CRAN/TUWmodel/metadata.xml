		Lumped/Semi-Distributed Hydrological Model for Education Purposes
		// The model, developed at the Vienna University of Technology,
		is a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model, following the
		structure of the HBV model. The model can also be run in a
		semi-distributed fashion and with dual representation of soil
		layer. The model runs on a daily or shorter time step and
		consists of a snow routine, a soil moisture routine and a flow
		routing routine. See Parajka, J., R. Merz, G. Bloeschl (2007)
