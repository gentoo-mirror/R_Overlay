		Simplified Access to Brazilian Financial and Macroeconomic Data
		// It offers simplified access to Brazilian macroeconomic and
		financial indicators selected from official sources, such as
		the 'IBGE' (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics)
		via the 'SIDRA' API and the 'Central Bank of Brazil' via the
		'SGS' API. It allows users to quickly retrieve and visualize
		data series such as the unemployment rate and the Selic
		interest rate. This package was developed for data access and
		visualization purposes, without generating forecasts or
		statistical results. For more information, see the official
		APIs: https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/ and
		https://dadosabertos.bcb.gov.br/dataset/.
