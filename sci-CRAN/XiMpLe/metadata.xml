		A Simple XML Tree Parser and Generator // Provides a simple XML
		tree parser/generator. It includes functions to read XML files
		into R objects, get information out of and into nodes, and
		write R objects back to XML code. It's not as powerful as the
		'XML' package and doesn't aim to be, but for simple XML
		handling it could be useful. It was originally developed for
		the R GUI and IDE 'RKWard' https://rkward.kde.org, to make
		plugin development easier.
