		Graphical Independence Filtering // Provides a method of
		recovering the precision matrix for Gaussian graphical models
		efficiently. Our approach could be divided into three
		categories. First of all, we use Hard Graphical Thresholding
		for best subset selection problem of Gaussian graphical model,
		and the core concept of this method was proposed by Luo et al.
		(2014) arXiv:1407.7819. Secondly, a closed form solution for
		graphical lasso under acyclic graph structure is implemented in
		our package (Fattahi and Sojoudi (2019)
		http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/17-501.html). Furthermore, we
		implement block coordinate descent algorithm to efficiently
		solve the covariance selection problem (Dempster (1972)
		doi:10.2307/2528966). Our package is computationally efficient
		and can solve ultra-high-dimensional problems, e.g. p  10,000,
		in a few minutes.
