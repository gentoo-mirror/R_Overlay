		Conditional Density Estimation with Neural Network Conditional
		Mixtures // Neural network conditional mixtures are mixture
		models whose parameters are predicted by a neural network. The
		mixture model can thus change its parameters in response to
		changes in predictive covariates. Mixtures included are
		gaussian, log-normal and hybrid Pareto mixtures. The latter
		relies on the generalized Pareto distribution to account for
		the presence of large extreme events. The unconditional
		mixtures are also available.
