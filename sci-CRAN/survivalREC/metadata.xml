		Nonparametric Estimation of the Distribution of Gap Times for
		Recurrent Events // Provides estimates for the bivariate and
		trivariate distribution functions and bivariate and trivariate
		survival functions for censored gap times. Two approaches,
		using existing methodologies, are considered: (i) the Lin's
		estimator, which is based on the extension the Kaplan-Meier
		estimator of the distribution function for the first event time
		and the Inverse Probability of Censoring Weights for the second
		time (Lin DY, Sun W, Ying Z (1999) doi:10.1093/biomet/86.1.59
		and (ii) another estimator based on Kaplan-Meier weights (Una-
		Alvarez J, Meira-Machado L (2008)
		https://w3.math.uminho.pt/~lmachado/Biometria_conference.pdf).
		The proposed methods are the landmark estimators based on
		subsampling approach, and the estimator based on weighted
		cumulative hazard estimator. The package also provides
		nonparametric estimator conditional to a given continuous
		covariate. All these methods have been submitted to be
		published.
