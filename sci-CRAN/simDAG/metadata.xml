		Simulate Data from a DAG and Associated Node Information //
		Simulate complex data from a given directed acyclic graph and
		information about each individual node. Root nodes are simply
		sampled from the specified distribution. Child Nodes are
		simulated according to one of many implemented regressions,
		such as logistic regression, linear regression, poisson
		regression and more. Also includes a comprehensive framework
		for discrete-time simulation, which can generate even more
		complex longitudinal data. For more details, see Robin Denz,
		Nina Timmesfeld (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2506.01498.
