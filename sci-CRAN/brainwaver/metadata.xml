		Basic wavelet analysis of multivariate time series with a
		visualisation and parametrisation using graph theory. // This
		package computes the correlation matrix for each scale of a
		wavelet decomposition, namely the one performed by the R
		package waveslim (Whitcher, 2000). An hypothesis test is
		applied to each entry of one matrix in order to construct an
		adjacency matrix of a graph. The graph obtained is finally
		analysed using the small-world theory (Watts and Strogatz,
		1998) and using the computation of efficiency (Latora, 2001),
		tested using simulated attacks. The brainwaver project is
		complementary to the camba project for brain-data
		preprocessing. A collection of scripts (with a makefile) is
		avalaible to download along with the brainwaver package, see
		information on the webpage mentioned below.
