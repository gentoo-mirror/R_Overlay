		Graphical Display of Pairwise Linkage Disequilibria Between SNPs
		// Produces a graphical display, as a heat map, of measures of
		pairwise linkage disequilibria between single nucleotide
		polymorphisms (SNPs). Users may optionally include the physical
		locations or genetic map distances of each SNP on the plot. The
		methods are described in Shin et al. (2006)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v016.c03. Users should note that the imported
		package 'snpStats' and the suggested packages 'rtracklayer',
		'GenomicRanges', 'GenomInfoDb' and 'IRanges' are all
		BioConductor packages https://bioconductor.org.
