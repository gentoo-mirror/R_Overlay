		Graphical Display of Pairwise Linkage Disequilibria Between SNPs
		// Produces a graphical display, as a heat map, of measures of
		pairwise linkage disequilibria between SNPs. Users may
		optionally include the physical locations or genetic map
		distances of each SNP on the plot. Users should note that the
		imported package 'snpStats' and the suggested packages
		'rtracklayer', 'GenomicRanges', 'GenomInfoDb' and 'IRanges' are
		all BioConductor packages https://bioconductor.org.
