		MAGIC - Markov Affinity-Based Graph Imputation of Cells // MAGIC
		(Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells) is a method
		for addressing technical noise in single-cell data, including
		under-sampling of mRNA molecules, often termed "dropout" which
		can severely obscure important gene-gene relationships. MAGIC
		shares information across similar cells, via data diffusion, to
		denoise the cell count matrix and fill in missing transcripts.
