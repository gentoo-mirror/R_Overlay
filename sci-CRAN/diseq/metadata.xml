		Estimation Methods for Markets in Disequilibrium // Provides
		estimation methods for markets in equilibrium and
		disequilibrium. Specifically, it supports the estimation of an
		equilibrium and four disequilibrium models with both correlated
		and independent shocks. It also provides post-estimation
		analysis tools, such as aggregation and marginal effects
		calculations. The estimation methods are based on full
		information maximum likelihood techniques given in Maddala and
		Nelson (1974) doi:10.2307/1914215. They are implemented using
		the analytic derivative expressions calculated in
		Karapanagiotis (2020) doi:10.2139/ssrn.3525622. The equilibrium
		estimation constitutes a special case of a system of
		simultaneous equations. The disequilibrium models, instead,
		replace the market clearing condition with a short side rule
		and allow for different specifications of price dynamics.
