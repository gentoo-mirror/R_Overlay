		Robust Analytical Methods for Evaluating Educational
		Interventions using Randomised Controlled Trials Designs // The
		eefAnalytics provides tools for analysing data from evaluations
		of educational interventions using a randomised controlled
		trial designs. It provides analytical tools to perform
		sensitivity analysis using different methods(e.g. frequentist
		models with bootstrapping and permutations options, Bayesian
		models). The functions contained in this package can be used
		for simple individual randomised trials, cluster randomised
		trials and multisite trials. The methods can also be used more
		widely beyond education trials. This package can be used to
		evaluate other interventions designs using Frequentist and
		Bayesian multilevel models.
