		Robust Analytical Methods for Evaluating Educational
		Interventions using Randomised Controlled Trials Designs //
		Analysing data from evaluations of educational interventions
		using a randomised controlled trial design. Various analytical
		tools to perform sensitivity analysis using different methods
		are supported (e.g. frequentist models with bootstrapping and
		permutations options, Bayesian models). The included commands
		can be used for simple randomised trials, cluster randomised
		trials and multisite trials. The methods can also be used more
		widely beyond education trials. This package can be used to
		evaluate other intervention designs using Frequentist and
		Bayesian multilevel models.
