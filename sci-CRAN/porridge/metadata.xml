		Ridge-Type Penalized Estimation of a Potpourri of Models // The
		name of the package is derived from the French, 'pour' ridge,
		and provides functionality for ridge-type estimation of a
		potpourri of models. Currently, this estimation concerns that
		of various Gaussian graphical models from different study
		designs. Among others it considers the regular Gaussian
		graphical model and a mixture of such models. The porridge-
		package implements the estimation of the former either from i)
		data with replicated observations by penalized loglikelihood
		maximization using the regular ridge penalty on the parameters
		(van Wieringen, Chen, 2019) or ii) from non-replicated data by
		means of the generalized ridge estimator that allows for both
		the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative prior information
		on the precision matrix via element-wise penalization and
		shrinkage (van Wieringen, 2019,
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1604374). Additionally, the porridge-
		package facilitates the ridge penalized estimation of a mixture
		of Gaussian graphical models (Aflakparast et al., 2018,
		doi:10.1002/bimj.201700102).
