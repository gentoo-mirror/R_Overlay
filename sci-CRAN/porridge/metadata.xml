		Ridge-Type Penalized Estimation of a Potpourri of Models // The
		name of the package is derived from the French, 'pour' ridge,
		and provides functionality for ridge-type estimation of a
		potpourri of models. Currently, this estimation concerns that
		of various Gaussian graphical models from different study
		designs. Among others it considers the regular Gaussian
		graphical model and a mixture of such models. The porridge-
		package implements the estimation of the former either from i)
		data with replicated observations by penalized loglikelihood
		maximization using the regular ridge penalty on the parameters
		(van Wieringen, Chen, 2021, doi:10.1002/sim.9028) or ii) from
		non-replicated data by means of either a ridge estimator with
		multiple shrinkage targets (as presented in van Wieringen et
		al. 2020, doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2020.104621) or the generalized
		ridge estimator that allows for both the inclusion of
		quantitative and qualitative prior information on the precision
		matrix via element-wise penalization and shrinkage (van
		Wieringen, 2019, doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1604374).
		Additionally, the porridge-package facilitates the ridge
		penalized estimation of a mixture of Gaussian graphical models
		(Aflakparast et al., 2018, doi:10.1002/bimj.201700102).
