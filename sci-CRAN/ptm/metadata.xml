		Analyses of Protein Post-Translational Modifications // Contains
		utilities for the analysis of post-translational modifications
		(PTMs) in proteins, with particular emphasis on the
		sulfoxidation of methionine residues. Features include the
		ability to download, filter and analyze data from the
		sulfoxidation database 'MetOSite'. Utilities to search and
		characterize S-aromatic motifs in proteins are also provided.
		In addition, functions to analyze sequence environments around
		modifiable residues in proteins can be found. For instance,
		'ptm' allows to search for amino acids either overrepresented
		or avoided around the modifiable residues from the proteins of
		interest. Functions tailored to test statistical hypothesis
		related to these differential sequence environments are also
		implemented. Further and detailed information regarding the
		methods in this package can be found in (Aledo (2020)
		https://metositeptm.com).
