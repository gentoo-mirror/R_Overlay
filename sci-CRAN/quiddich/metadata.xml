		QUick IDentification of DIagnostic CHaracters // Provides tools
		for an automated identification of diagnostic molecular
		characters, i.e. such columns in a given nucleotide or amino
		acid alignment that allow to distinguish taxa from each other.
		These characters can then be used to complement the formal
		descriptions of the taxa, which are often based on
		morphological and anatomical features. Especially for
		morphologically cryptic species, this will be helpful. QUIDDICH
		distinguishes between four different types of diagnostic
		characters. For more information, see "Kuehn, A.L., Haase, M.
		2019. QUIDDICH: QUick IDentification of DIagnostic CHaracters."
