		Pseudo Computer Models for Optimization // A suite of computer
		model test functions that can be used to test and evaluate
		algorithms for Bayesian (also known as sequential)
		optimization. Some of the functions have known functional
		forms, however, most are intended to serve as black-box
		functions where evaluation requires running computer code that
		reveals little about the functional forms of the objective
		and/or constraints. The primary goal of the package is to
		provide users (especially those who do not have access to real
		computer models) a source of reproducible and shareable
		examples that can be used for benchmarking algorithms. The
		package is a living repository, and so more functions will be
		added over time. For function suggestions, please do contact
		the author of the package.
