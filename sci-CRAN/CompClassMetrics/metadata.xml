		Classification Measures when Subclasses are Involved // Accuracy
		metrics are commonly used to assess the discriminating ability
		of diagnostic tests or biomarkers. Among them, metrics based on
		the ROC framework are particularly popular. When classification
		involves subclasses, the package 'CompClassMetrics' includes
		functions that can provide the point estimate, confidence
		interval as well as true values if a parametric setting is
		known. For more details see Nan and Tian (2025)
