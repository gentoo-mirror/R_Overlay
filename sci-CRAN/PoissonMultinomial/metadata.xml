		The Poisson-Multinomial Distribution // Implementation of the
		exact, normal approximation, and simulation-based methods for
		computing the probability mass function (pmf) and cumulative
		distribution function (cdf) of the Poisson-Multinomial
		distribution, together with a random number generator for the
		distribution. The exact method is based on multi-dimensional
		fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the characteristic
		function of the Poisson-Multinomial distribution. The normal
		approximation method uses a multivariate normal distribution to
		approximate the pmf of the distribution based on central limit
		theorem. The simulation method is based on the law of large
		numbers. Details about the methods are available in Lin, Wang,
		and Hong (2022) DOI:10.1007/s00180-022-01299-0.
