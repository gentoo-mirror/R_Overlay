		Generalized Propensity Score Estimation and Matching for Multiple
		Groups // Implements the Vector Matching algorithm to match
		multiple treatment groups based on previously estimated
		generalized propensity scores. The package includes tools for
		visualizing initial confounder imbalances, estimating treatment
		assignment probabilities using various methods, defining the
		common support region, performing matching across multiple
		groups, and evaluating matching quality. For more details, see
		Lopez and Gutman (2017) doi:10.1214/17-STS612.
