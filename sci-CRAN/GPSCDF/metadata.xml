		Generalized Propensity Score Cumulative Distribution Function //
		Implements the generalized propensity score cumulative
		distribution function proposed by Greene (2017) https://digital
		commons.library.tmc.edu/dissertations/AAI10681743/. A single
		scalar balancing score is calculated for any generalized
		propensity score vector with three or more treatments. This
		balancing score is used for propensity score matching and
		stratification in outcome analyses when analyzing either
		ordinal or multinomial treatments.
