		Optimal Subsampling Methods for Statistical Models // Balancing
		computational and statistical efficiency, subsampling
		techniques offer a practical solution for handling large-scale
		data analysis. Subsampling methods enhance statistical modeling
		for massive datasets by efficiently drawing representative
		subsamples from full dataset based on tailored sampling
		probabilities. These probabilities are optimized for specific
		goals, such as minimizing the variance of coefficient estimates
		or reducing prediction error.
