		Distributional Method for the Dichotomisation of Continuous
		Outcomes // Contains a range of functions covering the present
		development of the distributional method for the
		dichotomisation of continuous outcomes. The method provides
		estimates with standard error of a comparison of proportions
		(difference, odds ratio and risk ratio) derived, with similar
		precision, from a comparison of means. See the URL below or
		arXiv:1809.03279 for more information.
