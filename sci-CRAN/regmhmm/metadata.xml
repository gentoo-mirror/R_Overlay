		'regmhmm' Fits Hidden Markov Models with Regularization //
		Designed for longitudinal data analysis using Hidden Markov
		Models (HMMs). Tailored for applications in healthcare, social
		sciences, and economics, the main emphasis of this package is
		on regularization techniques for fitting HMMs. Additionally, it
		provides an implementation for fitting HMMs without
		regularization, referencing Zucchini et al. (2017,
		ISBN:9781315372488).
