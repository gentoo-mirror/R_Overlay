		Simplifies the Analysis of Pressure Volume and Leaf Drying Curves
		// Simplifies the manufacturing, analysis and display of
		pressure volume and leaf drying curves. From the progression of
		the curves turgor loss point, osmotic potential, apoplastic
		fraction as well as minimum conductance and stomatal closure
		can be derived. Methods adapted from Bartlett, Scoffoni, Sack
