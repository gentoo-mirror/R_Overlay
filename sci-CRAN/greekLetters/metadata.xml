		Routines for Writing Greek Letters and Mathematical Symbols on
		the 'RStudio' and 'RGui' // An implementation of functions to
		display Greek letters on the 'RStudio' (include subscript and
		superscript indexes) and 'RGui' (without subscripts and only
		with superscript 1, 2 or 3; because 'RGui' doesn't support
		printing the corresponding Unicode characters as a string: all
		subscripts ranging from 0 to 9 and superscripts equal to 0, 4,
		5, 6, 7, 8 or 9). The functions in this package do not work
		properly on the R console. Characters are used via Unicode and
		encoded as UTF-8 to ensure that they can be viewed on all
		operating systems. Other characters related to mathematics are
		included, such as the infinity symbol. All this accessible from
		very simple commands. This is a package that can be used for
		teaching purposes, the statistical notation for hypothesis
		testing can be written from this package and so it is possible
		to build a course from the 'swirlify' package. Another utility
		of this package is to create new summary functions that contain
		the functional form of the model adjusted with the Greek
		letters, thus making the transition from statistical theory to
		practice easier. In addition, it is a natural extension of the
		'clisymbols' package.
