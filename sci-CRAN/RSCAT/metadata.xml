		Shadow-Test Approach to Computerized Adaptive Testing // As an
		advanced approach to computerized adaptive testing (CAT),
		shadow testing (van der Linden(2005) doi:10.1007/0-387-29054-0)
		dynamically assembles entire shadow tests as a part of
		selecting items throughout the testing process. Selecting items
		from shadow tests guarantees the compliance of all content
		constraints defined by the blueprint. 'RSCAT' is an R package
		for the shadow-test approach to CAT. The objective of 'RSCAT'
		is twofold: 1) Enhancing the effectiveness of shadow-test CAT
		simulation; 2) Contributing to the academic and scientific
		community for CAT research.
