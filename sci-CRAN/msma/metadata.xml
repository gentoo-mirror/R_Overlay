		Multiblock Sparse Multivariable Analysis // Several functions can
		be used to analyze multiblock multivariable data. If the input
		is a single matrix, then principal components analysis (PCA) is
		implemented. If the input is a list of matrices, then
		multiblock PCA is implemented. If the input is two matrices,
		for exploratory and objective variables, then partial least
		squares (PLS) analysis is implemented. If the input is two
		lists of matrices, for exploratory and objective variables,
		then multiblock PLS analysis is implemented. Additionally, if
		an extra outcome variable is specified, then a supervised
		version of the methods above is implemented. For each method,
		sparse modeling is also incorporated. Functions for selecting
		the number of components and regularized parameters are also
		provided.
