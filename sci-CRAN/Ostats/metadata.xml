		O-Stats, or Pairwise Community-Level Niche Overlap Statistics //
		O-statistics, or overlap statistics, measure the degree of
		community-level trait overlap. They are estimated by fitting
		nonparametric kernel density functions to each species trait
		distribution and calculating their areas of overlap. For
		instance, the median pairwise overlap for a community is
		calculated by first determining the overlap of each species
		pair in trait space, and then taking the median overlap of each
		species pair in a community. This median overlap value is
		called the O-statistic (O for overlap). The Ostats() function
		calculates separate univariate overlap statistics for each
		trait, while the Ostats_multivariate() function calculates a
		single multivariate overlap statistic for all traits.
		O-statistics can be evaluated against null models to obtain
		standardized effect sizes. Ostats is part of the collaborative
		Macrosystems Biodiversity Project "Local- to continental-scale
		drivers of biodiversity across the National Ecological
		Observatory Network (NEON)." For more information on this
		project, see the Macrosystems Biodiversity Website
		(https://neon-biodiversity.github.io/). Calculation of
		O-statistics is described in Read et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1111/ecog.03641, and a teaching module for introducing
		the underlying biological concepts at an undergraduate level is
		described in Grady et al. (2018) http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v14/is
		sues/figure_sets/grady/abstract.html.
