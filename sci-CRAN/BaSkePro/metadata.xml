		Bayesian Model to Archaeological Faunal Skeletal Profiles // Tool
		to perform Bayesian inference of carcass processing/transport
		strategy and bone attrition from archaeofaunal skeletal
		profiles characterized by percentages of MAU (Minimum
		Anatomical Units). The approach is based on a generative model
		for skeletal profiles that replicates the two phases of
		formation of any faunal assemblage: initial accumulation as a
		function of human transport strategies and subsequent
		attrition.Two parameters define this model: 1) the transport
		preference (alpha), which can take any value between - 1
		(mostly axial contribution) and 1 (mostly appendicular
		contribution) following strategies constructed as a function of
		butchering efficiency of different anatomical elements and the
		results of ethnographic studies, and 2) degree of attrition
		(beta), which can vary between 0 (no attrition) and 10 (maximum
		attrition) and relates the survivorship of bone elements to
		their maximum bone density. Starting from uniform prior
		probability distribution functions of alpha and beta, a Monte
		Carlo Markov Chain sampling based on a random walk Metropolis-
		Hasting algorithm is adopted to derive the posterior
		probability distribution functions, which are then available
		for interpretation. During this process, the likelihood of
		obtaining the observed percentages of MAU given a pair of
		parameter values is estimated by the inverse of the Chi2
		statistic, multiplied by the proportion of elements within a 1
		percent of the observed value. See Ana B. Marin-Arroyo, David
		Ocio (2018).doi:10.1080/08912963.2017.1336620.
