		Efficient Gibbs-Sampler for Markov-Modulated-Poisson-Processes //
		Efficient implementation of the Gibbs sampler by Fearnheard and
		Sherlock (2006) DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2006.00566.x for the
		Markov modulated Poisson process that uses 'C++' via the 'Rcpp'
		interface. Fearnheard and Sherlock proposed an exact Gibbs-
		sampler for performing Bayesian inference on Markov Modulated
		Poisson processes. This package is an efficient implementation
		of their proposal for binned data. Furthermore, the package
		contains an efficient implementation of the hierarchical MMPP
		framework, proposed by Clausen, Adams, and Briers (2017) https:
		//github.com/hc2116/MMPPsampler/blob/master/Master_thesis_Henry
		.pdf, that is tailored towards inference on network flow
		arrival data and extends Fearnheard and Sherlock's Gibbs
		sampler. Both frameworks harvests greatly from routines that
		are optimised for this specific problem in order to remain
		scalable and efficient for large amounts of input data. These
		optimised routines include  matrix exponentiation and
		multiplication, and endpoint-conditioned Markov process
		sampling. Both implementations require an input vector that
		contains the binned observations, the length of a binning
		interval, the number of states of the hidden Markov process,
		and lose prior hyperparameters. As a return, the user receives
		the desired number of sample trajectories of the hidden Markov
		process as well as the likelihood of each trajectory.
