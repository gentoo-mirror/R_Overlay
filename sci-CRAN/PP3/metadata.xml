		Three-Dimensional Exploratory Projection Pursuit // Exploratory
		projection pursuit is a method to discovers structure in
		multivariate data. At heart this package uses a projection
		index to evaluate how interesting a specific three-dimensional
		projection of multivariate data (with more than three
		dimensions) is. Typically, the main structure finding algorithm
		starts at a random projection and then iteratively changes the
		projection direction to move to a more interesting one. In
		other words, the projection index is maximised over the
		projection direction to find the most interesting projection.
		This maximum is, though, a local maximum. So, this code has the
		ability to restart the algorithm from many different starting
		positions automatically. Routines exist to plot a density
		estimate of projection indices over the runs, this enables the
		user to obtain an idea of the distribution of the projection
		indices, and, hence,  which ones might be interesting.
		Individual projection solutions, including those identified as
		interesting, can be extracted and plotted individually. The
		package can make use of the mclapply() function to execute
		multiple runs in parallel to speed up index discovery.
		Projection pursuit is similar to independent component
		analysis. This package uses a projection index that maximises
		an entropy measure to look for projections that exhibit non-
		normality, and operates on sphered data. Hence, information
		from this package is different from that obtained from
		principal components analysis, but the rationale behind both
		methods is similar. Nason, G. P. (1995) doi:10.2307/2986135.
