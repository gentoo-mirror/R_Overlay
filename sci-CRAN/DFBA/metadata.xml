		Distribution-Free Bayesian Analysis // A set of functions to
		perform distribution-free Bayesian analyses. Included are
		Bayesian analogues to the frequentist Mann-Whitney U test, the
		Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test, Kendall's Tau Rank Correlation
		Coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal's Gamma, McNemar's Test, the
		binomial test, the sign test, the median test, as well as
		distribution-free methods for testing contrasts among condition
		and for computing Bayes factors for hypotheses. The package
		also includes procedures to estimate the power of distribution-
		free Bayesian tests based on data simulations using various
		probability models for the data. The set of functions provide
		data analysts with a set of Bayesian procedures that avoids
		requiring parametric assumptions about measurement error and is
		robust to problem of extreme outlier scores.
