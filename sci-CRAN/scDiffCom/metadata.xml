		Differential Analysis of Intercellular Communication from scRNA-
		Seq Data // Analysis tools to investigate changes in
		intercellular communication from scRNA-seq data. Using a Seurat
		object as input, the package infers which cell-cell
		interactions are present in the dataset and how these
		interactions change between two conditions of interest (e.g.
		young vs old). It relies on an internal database of ligand-
		receptor interactions (available for human, mouse and rat) that
		have been gathered from several published studies. Detection
		and differential analyses rely on permutation tests. The
		package also contains several tools to perform over-
		representation analysis and visualize the results. See Lagger,
		C. et al. (2023) doi:10.1038/s43587-023-00514-x for a full
		description of the methodology.
