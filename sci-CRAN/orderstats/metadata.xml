		Efficiently Generates Random Order Statistic Variables // All the
		methods in this package generate a vector of uniform order
		statistics using a beta distribution and use an inverse
		cumulative distribution function for some distribution to give
		a vector of random order statistic variables for some
		distribution. This is much more efficient than using a loop
		since it is directly sampling from the order statistic
		distribution.
