		Extremely Fast Hashing of R Objects, Raw Data and Files using
		'xxHash' Algorithms // Extremely fast hashing of R objects
		using 'xxHash'.  R objects are hashed via the standard
		serialization mechanism in R.  Raw byte vectors and strings can
		be handled directly for compatibility with hashes created on
		other systems.  This implementation is a wrapper around the
		'xxHash' 'C' library which is available from
		https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash.
