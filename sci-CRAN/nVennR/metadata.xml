		Create n-Dimensional, Quasi-Proportional Venn Diagrams //
		Provides an interface for the "nVenn"" algorithm (Perez-Silva,
		Araujo-Voces and Quesada (2018),
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty109). This algorithm works for
		any number of sets, and usually yields pleasing and informative
		Venn diagrams with proportionality information. However,
		representing more than six sets takes a long time and is hard
		to interpret, unless many of the regions are empty. If you
		cannot make sense of the result, you may want to consider
		'UpSetR'.
