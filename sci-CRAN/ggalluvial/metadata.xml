		Alluvial Diagrams in 'ggplot2' // Alluvial diagrams encompass a
		variety of charts that use x-splines (alluvia and flows),
		sometimes augmented with stacked bars (lodes or strata), to
		visualize incidence structures derived from several data types,
		including repeated categorical measures, evolving
		classifications, and multi-dimensional categorical data. This
		package contains stat and geom layers that interpret multiple
		data formats compatible with this framework while hewing to the
		principles of tidy data and the grammar of graphics.
