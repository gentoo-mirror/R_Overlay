		Dynamic Models with Regime-Switching // Intensive longitudinal
		data have become increasingly prevalent in various scientific
		disciplines. Many such data sets are noisy, multivariate, and
		multi-subject in nature. The change functions may also be
		continuous, or continuous but interspersed with periods of
		discontinuities (i.e., showing regime switches). The package
		'dynr' (Dynamic Modeling in R) is an R package that implements
		a set of computationally efficient algorithms for handling a
		broad class of linear and nonlinear discrete- and continuous-
		time models with regime-switching properties under the
		constraint of linear Gaussian measurement functions. The
		discrete-time models can generally take on the form of a state-
		space or difference equation model. The continuous-time models
		are generally expressed as a set of ordinary or stochastic
		differential equations. All estimation and computations are
		performed in C, but users are provided with the option to
		specify the model of interest via a set of simple and easy-to-
		learn model specification functions in R. Model fitting can be
		performed using single-subject time series data or multiple-
		subject longitudinal data. Ou, Hunter,  Chow (2019)
		doi:10.32614%2FRJ-2019-012 provided a detailed introduction to
		the interface and more information on the algorithms.
