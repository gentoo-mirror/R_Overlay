		Modeling Earthquake Data Using 'ETAS' Model // Fits the space-
		time Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence ('ETAS') model to
		earthquake catalogs using a stochastic 'declustering' approach.
		The 'ETAS' model is a 'spatio-temporal' marked point process
		model and a special case of the 'Hawkes' process. The package
		is based on a Fortran program by 'Jiancang Zhuang' (available
		at http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/software.html), which is
		modified and translated into C++ and C such that it can be
		called from R. Parallel computing with 'OpenMP' is possible on
		supported platforms.
