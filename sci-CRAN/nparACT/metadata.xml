		Non-Parametric Measures of Actigraphy Data // Computes interdaily
		stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV)  the relative
		amplitude (RA) from actigraphy data as described in van Someren
		et al. (1999). Additionally, it also computes L5 (i.e. the 5
		hours with lowest average actigraphy amplitude) and M10 (the 10
		hours with highest average amplitude) as well as the respective
		start times. The flex versions will also compute the L-value
		for a user-defined number of minutes. IS describes the strength
		of coupling of a rhythm to supposedly stable zeitgebers. It
		varies between 0 (Gaussian Noise) and 1 for perfect IS. IV
		describes the fragmentation of a rhythm, i.e. the frequency and
		extent of transitions between rest and activity. It is near 0
		for a perfect sine wave, about 2 for Gaussian noise and may be
		even higher when a definite ultradian period of about 2 hrs is
		present. RA is the relative amplitude of a rhythm. Note that to
		obtain reliable results, actigraphy data should cover a
		reasonable number of days.
