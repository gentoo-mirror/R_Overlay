		Bayesian Modeling of Spatio-Temporal Data with R // Fits,
		validates and compares a number of Bayesian models for spatial
		and space time point referenced and areal unit data. Model
		fitting is done using several packages: 'rstan', 'INLA',
		'spBayes', 'spTimer', 'spTDyn', 'CARBayes' and 'CARBayesST'.
		Model comparison is performed using the DIC and WAIC,  and
		K-fold cross-validation where the user is free to select their
		own subset of data rows for validation. Sahu (2022)
		doi:10.1201/9780429318443 describes the methods in detail.
