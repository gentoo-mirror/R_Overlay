		Various Linear Mixed Model Analyses // This package offers three
		important components: (1) to construct a use-defined linear
		mixed model, (2) to employ one of linear mixed model
		approaches: minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE)
		(Rao, 1971) for variance component estimation and random effect
		prediction; and (3) to employ a jackknife resampling technique
		to conduct various statistical tests. In addition, this package
		provides the function for model or data evaluations.This R
		package offers fast computations for large data sets analyses
		for various irregular data structures.
