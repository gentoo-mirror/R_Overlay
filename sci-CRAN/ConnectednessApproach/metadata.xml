		Connectedness Approach // The estimation of static and dynamic
		connectedness measures is created in a modular and user-
		friendly way. Besides, the time domain connectedness
		approaches, this package further allows to estimate the
		frequency connectedness approach, the joint spillover index and
		the extended joint connectedness approach. In addition, all
		connectedness frameworks can be based upon orthogonalized and
		generalized VAR, QVAR, LASSO VAR, Ridge VAR, Elastic Net VAR
		and TVP-VAR models. Furthermore, the package includes the
		conditional, decomposed and partial connectedness measures as
		well as the pairwise connectedness index, influence index and
		corrected total connectedness index. Finally, a battery of
		datasets are available allowing to replicate a variety of
		connectedness papers.
