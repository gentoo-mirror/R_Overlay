		Unsupervised Learning Based Definition of Microbial Rare
		Biosphere // A tool to define rare biosphere. 'ulrb' solves the
		problem of the definition of rarity by replacing arbitrary
		thresholds with an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
		(partitioning around medoids, or k-medoids). This algorithm
		works for any type of microbiome data, provided there is an
		abundance table. For validation of this method to different
		abundance tables, see Pascoal et al, 2025. This method also
		works for non-microbiome data.
