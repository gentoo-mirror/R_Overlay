		Unsupervised Learning Based Definition of Microbial Rare
		Biosphere // A tool to define rare biosphere. 'ulrb' solves the
		problem of the definition of rarity by replacing human decision
		with an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (partitioning
		around medoids, or k-medoids). This algorithm works for any
		type of microbiome data, provided there is an abundance score
		for each phylogenetic unit. For validation of this method to
		several kinds of molecular data and environments, please see
		Pascoal et al, 2023 (in preparation). Preliminary data suggest
		this method also works well for non-microbiome data, if there
		is a species abundance table.
