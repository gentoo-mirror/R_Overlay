		Text Analysis with Emphasis on POS Tagging, Readability, and
		Lexical Diversity // A set of tools to analyze texts. Includes,
		amongst others, functions for automatic language detection,
		hyphenation, several indices of lexical diversity (e.g., type
		token ratio, HD-D/vocd-D, MTLD) and readability (e.g., Flesch,
		SMOG, LIX, Dale-Chall). Basic import functions for language
		corpora are also provided, to enable frequency analyses
		(supports Celex and Leipzig Corpora Collection file formats)
		and measures like tf-idf. Note: For full functionality a local
		installation of TreeTagger is recommended. It is also
		recommended to not load this package directly, but by loading
		one of the available language support packages from the 'l10n'
		repository https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos/l10n/.
		'koRpus' also includes a plugin for the R GUI and IDE RKWard,
		providing graphical dialogs for its basic features. The
		respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from
		a repository, as it is a part of RKWard. To make full use of
		this feature, please install RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org
		(plugins are detected automatically). Due to some restrictions
		on CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the
		project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, request
		features, or discuss the development of the package, please
		subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list
		(https://korpusml.reaktanz.de).
