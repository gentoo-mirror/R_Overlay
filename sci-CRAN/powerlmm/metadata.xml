		Power Analysis for Longitudinal Multilevel Models // Calculate
		power for the 'time x treatment' effect in two- and three-level
		multilevel longitudinal studies with missing data. Both the
		third-level factor (e.g. therapists, schools, or physicians),
		and the second-level factor (e.g. subjects), can be assigned
		random slopes. Studies with partially nested designs, unequal
		cluster sizes, unequal allocation to treatment arms, and
		different dropout patterns per treatment are supported. For all
		designs power can be calculated both analytically and via
		simulations. The analytical calculations extends the method
		described in Galbraith et al. (2002)
		doi:10.1016/S0197-2456(02)00205-2, to three-level models.
		Additionally, the simulation tools provides flexible ways to
		investigate bias, Type I errors and the consequences of model
		misspecification.
