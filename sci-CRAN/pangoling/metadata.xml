		Access to Large Language Model Predictions // Provides access to
		word predictability estimates using large language models
		(LLMs) based on 'transformer' architectures via integration
		with the 'Hugging Face' ecosystem https://huggingface.co/. The
		package interfaces with pre-trained neural networks and
		supports both causal/auto-regressive LLMs (e.g., 'GPT-2') and
		masked/bidirectional LLMs (e.g., 'BERT') to compute the
		probability of words, phrases, or tokens given their linguistic
		context. For details on GPT-2 and causal models, see Radford et
		al. (2019) https://storage.prod.researchhub.com/uploads/papers/
		2020/06/01/language-models.pdf, for details on BERT and masked
		models, see Devlin et al. (2019) doi:10.48550/arXiv.1810.04805.
		By enabling a straightforward estimation of word
		predictability, the package facilitates research in
		psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and natural
		language processing (NLP).
