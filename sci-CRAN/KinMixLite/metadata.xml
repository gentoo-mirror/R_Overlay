		Inference About Relationships from DNA Mixtures // Methods for
		inference about/under complex relationships using peak height
		data from DNA mixtures: the most basic example would be testing
		whether a contributor to a mixture is the father of a child of
		known genotype. This provides most of the functionality of the
		'KinMix' package, but with some loss of efficiency and
		restriction on problem size, as the latter uses 'RHugin' as the
		Bayes net engine, while this package uses 'gRain'. The package
		implements the methods introduced in Green, P. J. and Mortera,
		J. (2017) doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.02.001 and Green, P. J. and
		Mortera, J. (2021) doi:10.1111/rssc.12498.
