		Inference About Relationships from DNA Mixtures // Methods for
		inference about relationships between contributors to a DNA
		mixture and other individuals of known genotype: a basic
		example would be testing whether a contributor to a mixture is
		the father of a child of known genotype. This provides most of
		the functionality of the 'KinMix' package, but with some loss
		of efficiency and restriction on problem size, as the latter
		uses 'RHugin' as the Bayes net engine, while this package uses
		'gRain'. The package implements the methods introduced in
		Green, P. J. and Mortera, J. (2017)
