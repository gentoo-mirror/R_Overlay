		Insect Phenology Model Evaluation Based on Daily Temperatures //
		Generates predicted stage change days for an insect, based on
		daily temperatures and development rate parameters, as
		developed by Pollard (2014) http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/
		view/ethesisauthor/Pollard=3ACiaran_P=2E=3A=3A.html. A few
		example datasets are included and implemented for P.
		vulgatissima, the blue willow beetle, but the approach can be
		readily applied to other species that display similar
		behaviour.
