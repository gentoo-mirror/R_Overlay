		Multivariate Outlier Detection and Replacement // Provides a
		random forest based implementation of the method described in
		Chapter 7.1.2 (Regression model based anomaly detection) of
		Chandola et al. (2009) doi.acm.org/10.1145/1541880.1541882. It
		works as follows: Each numeric variable is regressed onto all
		other variables by a random forest. If the scaled absolute
		difference between observed value and out-of-bag prediction of
		the corresponding random forest is suspiciously large, then a
		value is considered an outlier. The package offers different
		options to replace such outliers, e.g. by realistic values
		found via predictive mean matching. Once the method is trained
		on a reference data, it can be applied to new data.
