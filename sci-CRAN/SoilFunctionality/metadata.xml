		Soil Functionality Measurement // Generally, soil functionality
		is characterized by its capability to sustain microbial
		activity, nutritional element supply, structural stability and
		aid for crop production. Since soil functions can be linked to
		80% of ecosystem services, conservation of degraded land should
		strive to restore not only the capacity of soil to sustain
		flora but also ecosystem provisions. The primary ecosystem
		services of soil are carbon sequestration, food or biomass
		production, provision of microbial habitat, nutrient recycling.
		However, the actual magnitude of soil functions provided by
		agricultural land uses has never been quantified. Nutrient
		supply capacity (NSC) is a measure of nutrient dynamics in
		restored land uses. Carbon accumulation proficiency (CAP) is a
		measure of ecosystem carbon sequestration. Biological activity
		index (BAI) is the average of responses of all enzyme
		activities in treated land over control/reference land. The CAP
		parameter investigates how land uses may affect carbon flows,
		retention, and sequestration. The CAP provides a signal for C
		cycles, flows, and the systems' relative operational supremacy.
