		Graphical and Numerical Checks for Mode-Finding Routines // Tools
		for checking that the output of an optimization algorithm is
		indeed at a local mode of the objective function.  This is
		accomplished graphically by calculating all one-dimensional
		"projection plots" of the objective function, i.e., varying
		each input variable one at a time with all other elements of
		the potential solution being fixed.  The numerical values in
		these plots can be readily extracted for the purpose of
		automated and systematic unit-testing of optimization routines.
