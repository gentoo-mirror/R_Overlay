		Dynamic ICAR Spatiotemporal Factor Models // Bayesian factor
		models are effective tools for dimension reduction. This is
		especially applicable to multivariate large-scale datasets. It
		allows researchers to understand the latent factors of the data
		which are the linear or non-linear combination of the
		variables. Dynamic Intrinsic Conditional Autocorrelative Priors
		(ICAR) Spatiotemporal Factor Models 'DIFM' package provides
		function to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), evaluation
		methods and visual plots from Shin and Ferreira
		(2023)doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2023.100763. Our method is a class
		of Bayesian factor model which can account for spatial and
		temporal correlations. By incorporating these correlations, the
		model can capture specific behaviors and provide predictions.
