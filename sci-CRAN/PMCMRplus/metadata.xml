		Calculate Pairwise Multiple Comparisons of Mean Rank Sums
		Extended // For one-way layout experiments the one-way ANOVA
		can be performed as an omnibus test. All-pairs multiple
		comparisons tests (Tukey-Kramer test, Scheffe test, LSD-test)
		and many-to-one tests (Dunnett test) for normally distributed
		residuals and equal within variance are available. Furthermore,
		all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's T2 test, Dunnett
		T3 test, Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one (Tamhane-
		Dunnett Test) for normally distributed residuals and
		heterogeneous variances are provided. Van der Waerden's normal
		scores test for omnibus, all-pairs and many-to-one tests is
		provided for non-normally distributed residuals and homogeneous
		variances. The Kruskal-Wallis, BWS and Anderson-Darling omnibus
		test and all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, Conover
		test, Dwass-Steele-Critchlow- Fligner test) as well as many-to-
		one (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, U-test) are given for the
		analysis of variance by ranks. Non-parametric trend tests
		(Jonckheere test, Cuzick test, Johnson-Mehrotra test, Spearman
		test) are included. In addition, a Friedman-test for one-way
		ANOVA with repeated measures on ranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack
		test for unbalanced CRBD is provided with consequent all-pairs
		tests (Nemenyi test, Siegel test, Miller test, Conover test,
		Exact test) and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar test,
		Exact test). A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's
		test for a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is
		given in this package as well as Gore's test for CRBD with
		multiple observations per cell is given.  Outlier tests,
		Mandel's k- and h statistic as well as functions for Type I
		error and Power analysis as well as generic summary, print and
		plot methods are provided.
