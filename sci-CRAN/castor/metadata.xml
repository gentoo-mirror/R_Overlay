		Efficient Phylogenetics on Large Trees // Efficient tree
		manipulation functions including pruning, rerooting,
		calculation of most-recent common ancestors, calculating
		distances from the tree root and calculating pairwise distance
		matrices. Calculation of phylogenetic signal and mean trait
		depth (trait conservatism). Ancestral state reconstruction and
		hidden character prediction of discrete characters, using
		Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony methods. Simulating
		and fitting models of trait evolution, and generating random
		trees using birth-death models.
