		Efficient Phylogenetics on Large Trees // Efficient phylogenetic
		analyses on massive phylogenies comprising up to millions of
		tips. Functions include pruning, rerooting, calculation of
		most-recent common ancestors, calculating distances from the
		tree root and calculating pairwise distances. Calculation of
		phylogenetic signal and mean trait depth (trait conservatism),
		ancestral state reconstruction and hidden character prediction
		of discrete characters, simulating and fitting models of trait
		evolution, fitting and simulating diversification models,
		dating trees, comparing trees, and reading/writing trees in
		Newick format. Citation: Louca, Stilianos and Doebeli, Michael
		(2017) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx701.
