		Efficient Phylogenetics on Large Trees // Efficient tree
		manipulations for large phylogenies, including pruning,
		rerooting, calculation of most-recent common ancestors,
		calculating distances from the tree root and calculating
		pairwise distances. Calculation of phylogenetic signal and mean
		trait depth (trait conservatism). Ancestral state
		reconstruction and hidden character prediction of discrete
		characters, using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony
		methods. Simulating and fitting models of trait evolution, and
		generating random trees using birth-death models. Citation:
