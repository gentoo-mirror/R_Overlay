		A Toolbox for Manipulating and Assessing Colors and Palettes //
		Carries out mapping between assorted color spaces including
		RGB, HSV, HLS, CIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB, and
		polar CIELAB. Qualitative, sequential, and diverging color
		palettes based on HCL colors are provided along with
		corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color palette choice is
		aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a shiny
		graphical user interface) and shiny apps with an HCL color
		picker and a color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting
		functions for displaying and assessing palettes include color
		swatches, visualizations of the HCL space, and trajectories in
		HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation functions include:
		desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and simulation of
		color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly,
		tritanomaly). Details can be found on the project web page at
		https://colorspace.R-Forge.R-project.org/ and in the
		accompanying scientific paper: Zeileis et al. (2020, Journal of
		Statistical Software, doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i01).
