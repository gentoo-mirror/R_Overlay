		A Toolbox for Manipulating and Assessing Colors and Palettes //
		Carries out mapping between assorted color spaces including
		RGB, HSV, HLS, CIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB and
		polar CIELAB. Qualitative, sequential, and diverging color
		palettes based on HCL colors are provided along with
		corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color palette choice is
		aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a shiny
		GUI) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker and a color vision
		deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for displaying and
		assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations of
		the HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum.
		Color manipulation functions include: desaturation,
		lightening/darkening, mixing, and simulation of color vision
		deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly, tritanomaly).
