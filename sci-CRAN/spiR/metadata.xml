		Wrapper for the Social Progress Index Data // In 2015, The 17
		United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals were adopted.
		'spiR' is a wrapper of several open datasets published by the
		Social Progress Imperative (https://www.socialprogress.org/),
		including the Social Progress Index (a synthetic measure of
		human development across the world). 'spiR''s goal is to
		provide data to help policymakers and researchers prioritize
		actions that accelerate social progress across the world in the
		context of the Sustainable Development Goals. Please cite:
		Warin, Th. (2019) "spiR: An R Package for the Social Progress
		Index", doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.11421573.
