		Classification and Feature Selection for microRNA/mRNA
		Interactions // Comprises a pipeline for predicting
		microRNA/mRNA interactions, as detailed in Williams, Calinescu,
		Mohorianu (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.12.23.424130. Its input
		consists of [a] a messenger RNA (mRNA) dataset (either in fasta
		format, focused on 3' UTRs or in gtf format; for the latter,
		the sequences of the 3 UTRs are generated using the genomic
		coordinates), [b] a microRNA dataset (in fasta format,
		retrieved from miRBase,  http://www.mirbase.org/) and [c] an
		interaction dataset (in csv format, from miRTarBase
		http://mirtarbase.cuhk.edu.cn/php/index.php). To characterise
		and predict microRNA/mRNA interactions, we use [a] statistical
		analyses based on Chi-squared and Fisher exact tests and [b]
		Machine Learning classifiers (decision trees, random forests
		and support vector machines). To enhance the accuracy of the
		classifiers we also employ feature selection approaches used in
		on conjunction with the classifiers. The feature selection
		approaches include a voting scheme for decision trees, a
		measure based on Gini index for random forests, forward feature
		selection and Genetic Algorithms on SVMs. The pipeline also
		includes a novel approach based on embryonic Genetic Algorithms
		which combines and optimises the forward feature selection and
		Genetic Algorithms. All analyses, including the classification
		and feature selection, are applicable on the microRNA seed
		features (default), on the full microRNA features and/or
		flanking features on the mRNA. The sets of features can be
		combined.
