		Genotype Calling for Bi-Allelic Marker Assays // Genotyping
		assays for bi-allelic markers (e.g. SNPs) produce signal
		intensities for the two alleles. 'fitPoly' assigns genotypes
		(allele dosages) to a collection of polyploid samples based on
		these signal intensities. 'fitPoly' replaces the older package
		'fitTetra' that was limited (a.o.) to only tetraploid
		populations whereas 'fitPoly' accepts any ploidy level.

		doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-172. New functions added on conversion
		of data from SNP array software formats, drawing of XY-
		scatterplots with or without genotype colors, checking against
		expected F1 segregation patterns, comparing results from two
		different assays (probes) for the same SNP, recovery from a
		saveMarkerModels() crash.
