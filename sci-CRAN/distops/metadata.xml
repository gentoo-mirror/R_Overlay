		Usual Operations for Distance Matrices in R // It provides the
		subset operator for dist objects and a function to compute
		medoid(s) that are fully parallelized leveraging the
		'RcppParallel' package. It also provides functions for package
		developers to easily implement their own parallelized dist()
		function using a custom 'C++'-based distance function.
