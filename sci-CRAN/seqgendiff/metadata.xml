		RNA-Seq Generation/Modification for Simulation //
		Generates/modifies RNA-seq data for use in simulations. We
		provide a suite of functions that will add a known amount of
		signal to a real RNA-seq dataset. The advantage of using this
		approach over simulating under a theoretical distribution is
		that common/annoying aspects of the data are more preserved,
		giving a more realistic evaluation of your method. The main
		functions are select_counts(), thin_diff(), thin_lib(),
		thin_gene(), thin_2group(), thin_all(), and effective_cor().
