		Consistent Economic Trend Cycle Decomposition // Determining
		potential output and the output gap - two inherently
		unobservable variables - is a major challenge for
		macroeconomists. 'sectorgap' features a flexible modeling and
		estimation framework for a multivariate Bayesian state space
		model identifying economic output fluctuations consistent with
		subsectors of the economy. The proposed model is able to
		capture various correlations between output and a set of
		aggregate as well as subsector indicators. Estimation of the
		latent states and parameters is achieved using a simple Gibbs
		sampling procedure and various plotting options facilitate the
		assessment of the results. For details on the methodology and
		an illustrative example, see Streicher (2024)
