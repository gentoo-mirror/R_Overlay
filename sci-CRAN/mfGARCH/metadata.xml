		Mixed-Frequency GARCH Models // Estimating GARCH-MIDAS (MIxed-
		DAta-Sampling) models (Engle, Ghysels, Sohn, 2013,
		doi:10.1162/REST_a_00300) and related statistical inference,
		accompanying the paper "Two are better than one: volatility
		forecasting using multiplicative component GARCH models" by
		Conrad, Kleen (2018, Working Paper). The GARCH-MIDAS model
		decomposes the conditional variance of (daily) stock returns
		into a short- and long-term component, where the latter may
		depend on an exogenous covariate sampled at a lower frequency.
