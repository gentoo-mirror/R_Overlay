		Model C3 Photosynthesis // Simulate C3 photosynthesis using the
		Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry (1980) doi:10.1007/BF00386231
		model as described in Buckley and Diaz-Espejo (2015)
		doi:10.1111/pce.12459. It uses units to ensure that parameters
		are properly specified and transformed before calculations.
		Temperature response functions get automatically "baked" into
		all parameters based on leaf temperature following Bernacchi et
		al. (2002) doi:10.1104/pp.008250. The package includes boundary
		layer, cuticular, stomatal, and mesophyll conductances to CO2,
		which each can vary on the upper and lower portions of the
		leaf. Use straightforward functions to simulate photosynthesis
		over environmental gradients such as Photosynthetic Photon Flux
		Density (PPFD) and leaf temperature, or over trait gradients
		such as CO2 conductance or photochemistry.
