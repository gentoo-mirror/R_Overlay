		Greedy Stochastic Block Transition Models // Performs clustering
		on the nodes of an undirected binary dynamic network, by
		maximising the exact integrated complete likelihood. The greedy
		algorithm used is described in Rastelli, R. (2017) "Exact
		integrated completed likelihood maximisation in a stochastic
		block transition model for dynamic networks" arXiv:1710.03551.
