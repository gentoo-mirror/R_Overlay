		Deal with One and Two (Normal) Samples // We introduce an R
		function one_two_sample() which can deal with one and two
		(normal) samples, Ying-Ying Zhang, Yi Wei (2012)
		doi:10.2991/asshm-13.2013.29. For one normal sample x, the
		function reports descriptive statistics, plot, interval
		estimation and test of hypothesis of x. For two normal samples
		x and y, the function reports descriptive statistics, plot,
		interval estimation and test of hypothesis of x and y,
		respectively. It also reports interval estimation and test of
		hypothesis of mu1-mu2 (the difference of the means of x and y)
		and sigma1^2 / sigma2^2 (the ratio of the variances of x and
		y), tests whether x and y are from the same population, finds
		the correlation coefficient of x and y if x and y have the same
		length.
