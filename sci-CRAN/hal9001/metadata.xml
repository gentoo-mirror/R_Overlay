		The Scalable Highly Adaptive Lasso // A scalable implementation
		of the highly adaptive lasso algorithm, including routines for
		constructing sparse matrices of basis functions of the observed
		data, as well as a custom implementation of Lasso regression
		tailored to enhance efficiency when the matrix of predictors is
		composed exclusively of indicator functions. For ease of use
		and increased flexibility, the Lasso fitting routines invoke
		code from the 'glmnet' package by default. The highly adaptive
		lasso was first formulated and described by MJ van der Laan
		(2017) doi:10.1515/ijb-2015-0097, with practical demonstrations
		of its performance given by Benkeser and van der Laan (2016)
		doi:10.1109/DSAA.2016.93.
