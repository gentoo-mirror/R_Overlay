		Cell Type Pipes for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data // Annotate
		single-cell RNA sequencing data manually based on marker gene
		thresholds. Find cell type rules (gene+threshold) through
		exploration, use the popular piping operator '%%' to
		reconstruct complex cell type hierarchies. 'cellpypes' models
		technical noise to find positive and negative cells for a given
		expression threshold and returns cell type labels or
		pseudobulks. Cite this package as Frauhammer (2022)
