		INsulin Secretion ANalysEr // A user-friendly interface, using
		Shiny, to analyse glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)
		assays in pancreatic beta cells or islets. The package allows
		the user to import several sets of experiments from different
		spreadsheets and to perform subsequent steps: summarise in a
		tidy format, visualise data quality and compare experimental
		conditions without omitting to account for technical
		confounders such as the date of the experiment or the
		technician. Together, insane is a comprehensive method that
		optimises pre-processing and analyses of GSIS experiments in a
		friendly-user interface. The Shiny App was initially designed
		for EndoC-betaH1 cell line following method described in Ndiaye
		et al., 2017 (doi:10.1016/j.molmet.2017.03.011).
