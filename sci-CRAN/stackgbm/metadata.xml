		Stacked Gradient Boosting Machines // A minimalist implementation
		of model stacking by Wolpert (1992)
		doi:10.1016/S0893-6080(05)80023-1 for boosted tree models. A
		classic, two-layer stacking model is implemented, where the
		first layer generates features using gradient boosting trees,
		and the second layer employs a logistic regression model that
		uses these features as inputs. Utilities for training the base
		models and parameters tuning are provided, allowing users to
		experiment with different ensemble configurations easily. It
		aims to provide a simple and efficient way to combine multiple
		gradient boosting models to improve predictive model
		performance and robustness.
