		Simulating Survival Data from Change-Point Hazard Distributions
		// Simulates time-to-event data with type I right censoring
		using two methods: the inverse CDF method and our proposed
		memoryless method. The latter method takes advantage of the
		memoryless property of survival and simulates a separate
		distribution between change-points. We include two parametric
		distributions: exponential and Weibull. Inverse CDF method
		draws on the work of Rainer Walke (2010), https://www.demogr.mp
		g.de/papers/technicalreports/tr-2010-003.pdf.
