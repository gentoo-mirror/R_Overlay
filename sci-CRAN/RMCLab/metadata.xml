		Lab for Matrix Completion and Imputation of Discrete Rating Data
		// Collection of methods for rating matrix completion, which is
		a statistical framework for recommender systems. Another
		relevant application is the imputation of rating-scale survey
		data in the social and behavioral sciences. Note that matrix
		completion and imputation are synonymous terms used in
		different streams of the literature. The main functionality
		implements robust matrix completion for discrete rating-scale
		data with a low-rank constraint on a latent continuous matrix
		(Archimbaud, Alfons, and Wilms (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.20802). In addition, the package
		provides wrapper functions for 'softImpute' (Mazumder, Hastie,
		and Tibshirani, 2010,
		https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/mazumder10a.html; Hastie,
		Mazumder, Lee, Zadeh, 2015,
		https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/hastie15a.html) for easy tuning
		of the regularization parameter, as well as benchmark methods
		such as median imputation and mode imputation.
