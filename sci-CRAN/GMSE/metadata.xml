		Generalised Management Strategy Evaluation Simulator //
		Integrates game theory and ecological theory to construct
		social-ecological models that simulate the management of
		populations and stakeholder actions. These models build off of
		a previously developed management strategy evaluation (MSE)
		framework to simulate all aspects of management: population
		dynamics, manager observation of populations, manager decision
		making, and stakeholder responses to management decisions. The
		newly developed game-theoretic management strategy evaluation
		(GMSE) framework uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-
		making process of managers and stakeholders under conditions of
		change, uncertainty, and conflict.
