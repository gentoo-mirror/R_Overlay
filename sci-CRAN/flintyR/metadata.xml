		Flexible and Interpretable Non-Parametric Tests of
		Exchangeability // Given a multivariate dataset and some
		knowledge about the dependencies between its features, it is
		important to ensure the observations or individuals are
		exchangeable before fitting a model to the data in order to
		make inference from it, or assigning randomized treatments in
		order to estimate treatment effects. This package provides a
		flexible non-parametric test of exchangeability, allowing the
		user to specify the feature dependencies by hand. See Aw,
		Spence and Song (2021) for the accompanying paper.
