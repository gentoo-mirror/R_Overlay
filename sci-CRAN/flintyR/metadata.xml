		Simple and Flexible Tests of Sample Exchangeability // Given a
		multivariate dataset and some knowledge about the dependencies
		between its features, it is customary to fit a statistical
		model to the features to infer parameters of interest. Such a
		procedure implicitly assumes that the sample is exchangeable.
		This package provides a flexible non-parametric test of this
		exchangeability assumption, allowing the user to specify the
		feature dependencies by hand as long as features can be grouped
		into disjoint independent sets. This package also allows users
		to test a dual hypothesis, which is, given that the sample is
		exchangeable, does a proposed grouping of the features into
		disjoint sets also produce statistically independent sets of
		features? See Aw, Spence and Song (2023) for the accompanying
		paper.
