		Kuhn-Tucker and Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value Models
		// Estimates and simulates Kuhn-Tucker demand models with
		individual heterogeneity. The package implements the multiple-
		discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model and the Kuhn-
		Tucker specification common in the environmental economics
		literature on recreation demand. Latent class and random
		parameters specifications can be implemented and the models are
		fit using maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation.
		All models are implemented in Stan, which is a C++ package for
		performing full Bayesian inference (see Stan Development Team,
		2019) https://mc-stan.org/. The package also implements demand
		forecasting (Pinjari and Bhat (2011)
		https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/23880) and
		welfare calculation (Lloyd-Smith (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.jocm.2017.12.002) for policy simulation.
