		Interactive Plots for RStudio // Interactive plotting functions
		for use within RStudio. The manipulate function accepts a
		plotting expression and a set of controls (e.g. slider, picker,
		checkbox, or button) which are used to dynamically change
		values within the expression. When a value is changed using its
		corresponding control the expression is automatically re-
		executed and the plot is redrawn.
