		RJ Clustering Algorithm // Clustering algorithm for high
		dimensional data. This algorithm is ideal for data where N  P.
		Assuming that P feature measurements on N objects are arranged
		in an NP matrix X, this package provides clustering based on
		the left Gram matrix XX^T. When the P-dimensional feature
		vectors of objects are drawn independently from a K distinct
		mixture distribution,  the N-dimensional  rows of the modified
		Gram matrix XX^T/P converges almost surely to K distinct
		cluster means. This transformation/projection thus allows  the
		clusters  to  be  tighter  with  order of P.  To simulate data,
		type "help('simulate_HD_data')" and to learn how to use the
		clustering algorithm, type "help('RJclust')".
