		Find Routes for Supersonic Aircraft // For supersonic aircraft,
		flying subsonic over land, find the best route between
		airports. Allow for coastal buffer and potentially closed
		regions. Use a minimal model of aircraft performance: the focus
		is on time saved versus subsonic flight, rather than on
		vertical flight profile. For modelling and forecasting, not for
		planning your flight!
