		Time to Event Analysis via Empirical Likelihood Inference //
		Computation of t-year survival probabilities and t-year risks
		with right censored survival data. The Kaplan-Meier estimator
		is used to provide estimates for data without competing risks
		and the Aalen-Johansen estimator is used when there are
		competing risks. Confidence intervals and p-values are obtained
		using either usual Wald-type inference or empirical likelihood
		inference, as described in Thomas and Grunkemeier (1975)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.1975.10480315 and Blanche (2020)
		doi:10.1007/s10985-018-09458-6. Functions for both one-sample
		and two-sample inference are provided. Unlike Wald-type
		inference, empirical likelihood inference always leads to
		consistent conclusions, in terms of statistical significance,
		when comparing two risks (or survival probabilities) via either
		a ratio or a difference.
