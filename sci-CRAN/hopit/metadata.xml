		Hierarchical Ordered Probit Models with Application to Reporting
		Heterogeneity // Self-reported health, happiness, attitudes,
		and other statuses or perceptions are often the subject of
		biases that may come from different sources. For example, the
		evaluation of own health may depend on previous medical
		diagnoses, functional status, and symptoms and signs of
		illness, as well as life-style behaviors including contextual
		social, gender, age-specific, linguistic and other cultural
		factors (Jylha 2009 doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.05.013;
		Oksuzyan et al. 2019 doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002). This
		package offers versatile functions for analyzing different
		self-reported ordinal variables and helping to estimate their
		biases. Specifically, the package provides the function to fit
		a generalized ordered probit model that regresses original
		self-reported status measures on two sets of independent
		variables (King et al. 2004 doi:10.1017/S0003055403000881;
		Jurges 2007 doi:10.1002/hec.1134; Oksuzyan et al. 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002). In contrast to standard
		ordered probit models, generalized ordered probit models relax
		the assumption that individuals use a common scale when rating
		their own statuses, and thus allow for distinguishing between
		the status (e.g., health) and reporting differences based on
		other individual characteristics. In other words, the model
		accounts for heterogeneity in reporting behaviors. The first
		set of variables (e.g., health variables) included in the
		regression are individual statuses and characteristics that are
		directly related to the self-reported variable. In case of
		self-reported health, these could be chronic conditions,
		mobility level, difficulties with daily activities, performance
		on grip strength tests, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle
		behaviors. The second set of independent variables (threshold
		variables) is used to model cut-points between adjacent self-
		reported response categories as functions of individual
		characteristics, such as gender, age group, education, and
		country (Oksuzyan et al. 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002). The model helps adjust
		for these specific socio-demographic and cultural differences
		in how the continuous latent health is projected onto the
		ordinal self-rated measure. The fitted model can be used to
		calculate an individual latent status variable that serves as a
		proxy of the true status. In case of self-reported health, the
		predicted latent health variable can be standardized to a
		health index, which varies from 0 representing the (model-
		based) worst health state to 1 representing the (model-based)
		best health in the sample. The standardized latent coefficients
		(disability weights for the case of self-rated health) provide
		information about the individual impact of the specific latent
		(e.g., health) variables on the latent (e.g., health)
		construct. For example, they indicate the extent to which the
		latent health index is reduced by the presence of Parkinsons
		disease, poor mobility, and other specific health measures
		(Jurges 2007 doi:10.1002/hec.1134; Oksuzyan et al. 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002). The latent index can in
		turn be used to reclassify the categorical status measure that
		has been adjusted for inter-individual differences in reporting
		behavior. Two methods for doing so are available, one which
		uses model estimated cut-points, and a second which
		reclassifies responses according to the percentiles of the
		original categorical response distribution (Jurges 2007
		doi:10.1002/hec.1134; Oksuzyan et al. 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002).
