		Hierarchical Ordered Probit Models with Application to Reporting
		Heterogeneity // Self-reported health, happiness, attitudes,
		and other statuses or perceptions are often the subject of
		biases that may come from different sources. For example, the
		evaluation of an individuals own health may depend on previous
		medical diagnoses, functional status, and symptoms and signs of
		illness; as on well as life-style behaviors, including
		contextual social, gender, age-specific, linguistic and other
		cultural factors (Jylha 2009
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.05.013; Oksuzyan et al. 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002). The hopit package offers
		versatile functions for analyzing different self-reported
		ordinal variables, and for helping to estimate their biases.
		Specifically, the package provides the function to fit a
		generalized ordered probit model that regresses original self-
		reported status measures on two sets of independent variables
		(King et al. 2004 doi:10.1017/S0003055403000881; Jurges 2007
		doi:10.1002/hec.1134; Oksuzyan et al. 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002). The first set of
		variables (e.g., health variables) included in the regression
		are individual statuses and characteristics that are directly
		related to the self-reported variable. In the case of self-
		reported health, these could be chronic conditions, mobility
		level, difficulties with daily activities, performance on grip
		strength tests, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle
		behaviors. The second set of independent variables (threshold
		variables) is used to model cut-points between adjacent self-
		reported response categories as functions of individual
		characteristics, such as gender, age group, education, and
		country (Oksuzyan et al. 2019
		doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002). The model helps to adjust
		for specific socio-demographic and cultural differences in how
		the continuous latent health is projected onto the ordinal
		self-rated measure. The fitted model can be used to calculate
		an individual predicted latent status variable, a latent index,
		and standardized latent coefficients; and makes it possible to
		reclassify a categorical status measure that has been adjusted
		for inter-individual differences in reporting behavior.
