		Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Other Gradient-Based MCMC Sampling
		Algorithms for 'nimble' // Provides gradient-based MCMC
		sampling algorithms for use with the MCMC engine provided by
		the 'nimble' package.  This includes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
		(HMC) and (under development) Langevin samplers.  The HMC
		sampler dynamically determines step size and number of leapfrog
		steps using the No-U-Turn (NUTS) algorithm as described in
		Hoffman and Gelman (2014) arXiv:1111.4246.  In addition,
		convenience functions are provided for generating and modifying
		MCMC configuration objects which employ HMC sampling.
