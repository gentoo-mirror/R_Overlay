		Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Other Gradient-Based MCMC Sampling
		Algorithms for 'nimble' // Provides gradient-based MCMC
		sampling algorithms for use with the MCMC engine provided by
		the 'nimble' package.  This includes two versions of
		Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) No-U-Turn (NUTS) sampling, and
		(under development) Langevin samplers.  The `NUTS_classic`
		sampler implements the original HMC-NUTS algorithm as described
		in Hoffman and Gelman (2014) arXiv:1111.4246.  The `NUTS`
		sampler is a modern version of HMC-NUTS sampling matching the
		HMC sampler available in version 2.32.2 of Stan (Stan
		Development Team, 2023). In addition, convenience functions are
		provided for generating and modifying MCMC configuration
		objects which employ HMC sampling.
