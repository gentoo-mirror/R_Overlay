		Automated Tuning and Evaluations of Ecological Niche Models //
		Runs ecological niche models over all combinations of user-
		defined settings (i.e., tuning), performs cross validation to
		evaluate models, and returns data tables to aid in selection of
		optimal model settings that balance goodness-of-fit and model
		complexity. Also has functions to partition data spatially (or
		not) for cross validation, to plot multiple visualizations of
		results, to run null models to estimate significance and effect
		sizes of performance metrics, and to calculate niche overlap
		between model predictions, among others. The package was
		originally built for Maxent models (Phillips et al. 2006,
		Phillips et al. 2017), but the current version allows possible
		extensions for any modeling algorithm. The extensive vignette,
		which guides users through most package functionality but
		unfortunately has a file size too big for CRAN, can be found
		here on the package's Github Pages website: https://jamiemkass.
