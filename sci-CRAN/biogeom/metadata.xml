		Biological Geometries // Is used to simulate and fit biological
		geometries. biogeom incorporates several novel universal
		parametric equations that can generate the profiles of bird
		eggs, flowers, linear and lanceolate leaves, seeds, starfish,
		and tree-rings (Gielis (2003) doi:10.3732/ajb.90.3.333; Shi et
		al. (2020) doi:10.3390/sym12040645), three growth-rate curves
		representing the ontogenetic growth trajectories of animals and
		plants against time, and the axially symmetrical and integral
		forms of all these functions (Shi et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.01.012; Shi et al. (2021)
		doi:10.3390/sym13081524). The optimization method proposed by
		Nelder and Mead (1965) doi:10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308 was used to
		estimate model parameters. biogeom includes several real data
		sets of the boundary coordinates of natural shapes, including
		avian eggs, fruit, lanceolate and ovate leaves, tree rings,
		seeds, and sea stars,and can be potentially applied to other
		natural shapes. biogeom can quantify the conspecific or
		interspecific similarity of natural outlines, and provides
		information with important ecological and evolutionary
		implications for the growth and form of living organisms.
