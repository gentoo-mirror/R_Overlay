		Tools for Joint Sentiment and Topic Analysis of Textual Data // A
		framework that joins topic modeling and sentiment analysis of
		textual data. The package implements a fast Gibbs sampling
		estimation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Griffiths and
		Steyvers (2004) doi:10.1073/pnas.0307752101) and Joint
		Sentiment/Topic Model (Lin, He, Everson and Ruger (2012)
		doi:10.1109/TKDE.2011.48). It offers a variety of helpers and
		visualizations to analyze the result of topic modeling. The
		framework also allows enriching topic models with dates and
		externally computed sentiment measures. A flexible aggregation
		scheme enables the creation of time series of sentiment or
		topical proportions from the enriched topic models. Moreover, a
		novel method jointly aggregates topic proportions and sentiment
		measures to derive time series of topical sentiment.
