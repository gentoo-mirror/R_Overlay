		Estimate Rolling Window Wavelet Correlation Between Two Time
		Series // Estimates and plots as a heat map the rolling window
		wavelet correlation (RWWC) coefficients statistically
		significant (within the 95% CI) between two regular (evenly
		spaced) time series. 'RolWinWavCor' also plots at the same
		graphic the time series under study. The 'RolWinWavCor' was
		designed for financial time series, but this software can be
		used with other kinds of data (e.g., climatic, ecological,
		geological, etc). The functions contained in 'RolWinWavCor' are
		highly flexible since these contains some parameters to
		personalize the time series under analysis and the heat maps of
		the rolling window wavelet correlation coefficients. Moreover,
		we have also included a data set (named EU_stock_markets) that
		contains nine European stock market indices to exemplify the
		use of the functions contained in 'RolWinWavCor'. Methods
		derived from Polanco-Martnez et al (2018)
