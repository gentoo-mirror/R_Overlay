		Robust Mixture Regression // Finite mixture models are a popular
		technique for modelling unobserved heterogeneity or to
		approximate general distribution functions in a semi-parametric
		way. They are used in a lot of different areas such as
		astronomy, biology, economics, marketing or medicine. This
		package is the implementation of popular robust mixture
		regression methods based on different algorithms including:
		fleximix, finite mixture models and latent class regression;
		CTLERob, component-wise adaptive trimming likelihood
		estimation; mixbi, bi-square estimation; mixL, Laplacian
		distribution; mixt, t-distribution; TLE, trimmed likelihood
		estimation. The implemented algorithms includes:  CTLERob
		stands for Component-wise adaptive Trimming Likelihood
		Estimation based mixture regression; mixbi stands for mixture
		regression based on bi-square estimation; mixLstands for
		mixture regression based on Laplacian distribution; TLE stands
		for Trimmed Likelihood Estimation based mixture regression. For
		more detail of the algorithms, please refer to below
		references. Reference: Chun Yu, Weixin Yao, Kun Chen (2017)
