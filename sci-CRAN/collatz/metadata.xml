		Functions Related to the Collatz/Syracuse/3n+1 Problem //
		Provides the basic functionality to interact with the Collatz
		conjecture. The parameterisation uses the same (P,a,b) notation
		as Conway's generalisations. Besides the function and reverse
		function, there is also functionality to retrieve the hailstone
		sequence, the "stopping time"/"total stopping time", or tree-
		graph. The only restriction placed on parameters is that both P
		and a can't be 0. For further reading, see
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture.
