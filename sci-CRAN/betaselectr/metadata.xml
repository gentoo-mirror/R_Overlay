		Betas-Select in Structural Equation Models and Linear Models //
		It computes betas-select, coefficients after standardization in
		structural equation models and regression models, standardizing
		only selected variables. Supports models with moderation, with
		product terms formed after standardization. It also offers
		confidence intervals that account for standardization,
		including bootstrap confidence intervals as proposed by Cheung
		et al. (2022) doi:10.1037/hea0001188.
