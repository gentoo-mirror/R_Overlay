		Estimate the Coefficients for Non-Convex Penalized Quantile
		Regression Model by using QICD Algorithm // Extremely fast
		algorithm "QICD", Iterative Coordinate Descent Algorithm for
		High-dimensional Nonconvex Penalized Quantile Regression. This
		algorithm combines the coordinate descent algorithm in the
		inner iteration with the majorization minimization step in the
		outside step. For each inner univariate minimization problem,
		we only need to compute a one-dimensional weighted median,
		which ensures fast computation. Tuning parameter selection is
		based on two different method: the cross validation and BIC for
		quantile regression model. Details are described in the Peng,B
		and Wang,L. (2015) linked to via the URL below with
		DOI:10.1080/10618600.2014.913516.
