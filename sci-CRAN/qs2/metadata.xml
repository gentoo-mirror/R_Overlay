		Efficient Serialization of R Objects // Streamlines and
		accelerates the process of saving and loading R objects,
		improving speed and compression compared to other methods. The
		package provides two compression formats: the 'qs2' format,
		which uses R serialization via the C API while optimizing
		compression and disk I/O, and the 'qdata' format, featuring
		custom serialization for slightly faster performance and better
		compression. Additionally, the 'qs2' format can be directly
		converted to the standard 'RDS' format, ensuring long-term
		compatibility with future versions of R.
