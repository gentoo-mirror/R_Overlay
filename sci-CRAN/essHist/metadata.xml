		The Essential Histogram // Provide an optimal histogram, in the
		sense of probability density estimation and features detection,
		by means of multiscale variational inference. In other words,
		the resulting histogram servers as an optimal density
		estimator, and meanwhile recovers the features, such as
		increases or modes, with both false positive and false negative
		controls. Moreover, it provides a parsimonious representation
		in terms of the number of blocks, which simplifies data
		interpretation. The only assumption for the method is that data
		points are independent and identically distributed, so it
		applies to fairly general situations, including continuous
		distributions, discrete distributions, and mixtures of both.
		For details see Li, Munk, Sieling and Walther (2016)
