		High Dimensional Bayesian Mediation Analysis // Perform mediation
		analysis in the presence of high-dimensional mediators based on
		the potential outcome framework. High dimensional Bayesian
		mediation (HDBM), developed by Song et al (2018)
		doi:10.1101/467399, relies on two Bayesian sparse linear mixed
		models to simultaneously analyze a relatively large number of
		mediators for a continuous exposure and outcome assuming a
		small number of mediators are truly active. This sparsity
		assumption also allows the extension of univariate mediator
		analysis by casting the identification of active mediators as a
		variable selection problem and applying Bayesian methods with
		continuous shrinkage priors on the effects.
