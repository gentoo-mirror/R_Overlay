		Produce R Functions to Create HTML Forms Based on SQL Meta Data
		// Offers meta programming style tools to generate configurable
		R functions that produce HTML forms based on table input and
		SQL meta data. Also generates functions for collecting the
		parameters of those HTML forms after they are submitted. Useful
		for quickly generating HTML forms based on existing SQL tables.
		To use the resultant functions, the output files containing
		those functions must be read into the R environment (perhaps
		using base::source()).
