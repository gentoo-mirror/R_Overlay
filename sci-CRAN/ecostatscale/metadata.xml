		Statistical Scaling Functions for Ecological Systems //
		Implementation of the scaling functions presented in "General
		statistical scaling laws for stability in ecological systems"
		by Clark et al in Ecology Letters DOI:10.1111/ele.13760.
		Includes functions for extrapolating variability, resistance,
		and resilience across spatial and ecological scales, as well as
		a basic simulation function for producing time series, and a
		regression routine for generating unbiased parameter estimates.
		See the main text of the paper for more details.
