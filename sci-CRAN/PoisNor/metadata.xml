		Simultaneous Generation of Multivariate Data with Poisson and
		Normal Marginals // Generates multivariate data with count and
		continuous variables with a pre-specified correlation matrix.
		The count and continuous variables are assumed to have Poisson
		and normal marginals, respectively. The data generation
		mechanism is a combination of the normal to anything principle
		and a connection between Poisson and normal correlations in the
		mixture. The details of the method are explained in Yahav et
		al. (2012) DOI:10.1002/asmb.901.
