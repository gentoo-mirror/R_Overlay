		The Attributable Fraction (AF) Described as a Function of Disease
		Heritability, Prevalence and Intervention Specific Factors //
		The AFfunction() is a function which returns an estimate of the
		Attributable Fraction (AF) and a plot of the AF as a function
		of heritability, disease prevalence, size of target group and
		intervention effect. Since the AF is a function of several
		factors, a shiny app is used to better illustrate how the
		relationship between the AF and heritability depends on several
		other factors. The app is ran by the function runShinyApp().
