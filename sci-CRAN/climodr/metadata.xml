		Climate Modeling with Point Data from Climate Stations // An
		automated and streamlined workflow for predictive climate
		mapping using climate station data. Works within an environment
		the user provides a destined path to - otherwise it's
		tempdir(). Quick and relatively easy creation of resilient and
		reproducible climate models, predictions and climate maps,
		shortening the usually long and complicated work of predictive
		modelling. For more information, please find the provided URL.
		Many methods in this package are new, but the main method is
		based on a workflow from Meyer (2019)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108815 and Meyer (2022)
		doi:10.1038/s41467-022-29838-9 , however, it was generalized
		and adjusted in the context of this package.
