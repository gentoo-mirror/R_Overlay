		Inference in Randomized Controlled Trials with Death and
		Missingness // In randomized studies involving severely ill
		patients, functional outcomes are often unobserved due to
		missed clinic visits, premature withdrawal or death. It is well
		known that if these unobserved functional outcomes are not
		handled properly, biased treatment comparisons can be produced.
		In this package, we implement a procedure for comparing
		treatments that is based on the composite endpoint of both the
		functional outcome and survival. The procedure was proposed in
		Wang et al. (2016) DOI:10.1111/biom.12594 and Wang et al.
		(2020) DOI:10.18637/jss.v093.i12. It considers missing data
		imputation with different sensitivity analysis strategies to
		handle the unobserved functional outcomes not due to death.
