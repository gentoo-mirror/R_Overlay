		Web Data Analysis by Bayesian Mixture of Markov Models //
		Designed for web usage data analysis, it implements tools to
		process web sequences and identify web browsing profiles
		through sequential classification. Sequences' clusters are
		identified by using a model-based approach, specifically
		mixture of discrete time first-order Markov models for
		categorical web sequences. A Bayesian approach is used to
		estimate model parameters and identify sequences classification
		as proposed by Fruehwirth-Schnatter and Pamminger (2010)
