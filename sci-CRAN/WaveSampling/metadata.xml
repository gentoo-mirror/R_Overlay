		Weakly Associated Vectors (WAVE) Sampling // Spatial data are
		generally auto-correlated, meaning that if two units selected
		are close to each other, then it is likely that they share the
		same properties. For this reason, when sampling in the
		population it is often needed that the sample is well spread
		over space. A new method to draw a sample from a population
		with spatial coordinates is proposed. This method is called
		wave (Weakly Associated Vectors) sampling. It uses the less
		correlated vector to a spatial weights matrix to update the
		inclusion probabilities vector into a sample. For more details
		see Raphal Jauslin and Yves Till (2019)
