		A computer program to detect markers responding to selection //
		In the new era of population genomics, surveys of genetic
		polymorphism ("genome scans") offer the opportunity to
		distinguish locus-specific from genome wide effects at many
		loci. Identifying presumably neutral regions of the genome that
		are assumed to be influenced by genome-wide effects only, and
		excluding presumably selected regions, is therefore critical to
		infer population demography and phylogenetic history reliably.
		Conversely, detecting locus-specific effects may help identify
		those genes that have been, or still are, targeted by natural
		selection. The software package DetSel has been developed to
		identify markers that show deviation from neutral expectation
		in pairwise comparisons of diverging populations.
