		Generalized Linear Models for Categorical Responses // In
		statistical modeling, there is a wide variety of regression
		models for categorical dependent variables (nominal or ordinal
		data); yet, there is no software embracing all these models
		together in a uniform and generalized format. Following the
		methodology proposed by Peyhardi, Trottier, and Gudon (2015)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asv042, we introduce 'GLMcat', an R package
		to estimate generalized linear models implemented under the
		unified specification (r, F, Z). Where r represents the ratio
		of probabilities (reference, cumulative, adjacent, or
		sequential), F the cumulative cdf function for the linkage, and
		Z, the design matrix. The package accompanies the paper
		"GLMcat: An R Package for Generalized Linear Models for
		Categorical Responses" in the Journal of Statistical Software,
		Volume 114, Issue 9 (see doi:10.18637/jss.v114.i09).
