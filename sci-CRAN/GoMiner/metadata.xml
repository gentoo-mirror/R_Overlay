		Automate the Mapping Between a List of Genes and Gene Ontology
		Categories // In gene-expression microarray studies, for
		example, one generally obtains a list of dozens or hundreds of
		genes that differ in expression between samples and then asks
		'What does all of this mean biologically?' Alternatively, gene
		lists can be derived conceptually in addition to
		experimentally. For instance, one might want to analyze a group
		of genes known as housekeeping genes. The work of the Gene
		Ontology (GO) Consortium geneontology.org provides a way to
		address that question. GO organizes genes into hierarchical
		categories based on biological process, molecular function and
		subcellular localization. The role of 'GoMiner' is to automate
		the mapping between a list of genes and GO, and to provide a
		statistical summary of the results as well as a visualization.
