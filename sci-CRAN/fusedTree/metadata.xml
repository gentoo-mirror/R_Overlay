		Fused Partitioned Regression for Clinical and Omics Data // Fit
		(generalized) linear regression models in each leaf node of a
		tree. The tree is constructed using clinical variables only.
		The linear regression models are constructed using (high-
		dimensional) omics variables only. The leaf-node-specific
		regression models are estimated using the penalized likelihood
		including a standard ridge (L2) penalty and a fusion penalty
		that links the leaf-node-specific regression models to one
		another. The intercepts of the leaf nodes reflect the effects
		of the clinical variables and are left unpenalized. The tree,
		fitted with the clinical variables only, should be constructed
		outside of the package with the 'rpart' 'R' package. See
		Goedhart and others (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2411.02396 for
		details on the method.
