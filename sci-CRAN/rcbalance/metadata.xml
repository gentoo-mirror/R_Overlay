		Large, Sparse Optimal Matching with Refined Covariate Balance //
		Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units and
		control units in observational studies.  Provisions are made
		for refined covariate balance constraints, which include fine
		and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are optimal in
		the sense that they are computed as solutions to network
		optimization problems rather than greedy algorithms. See
		Pimentel, et al.(2015) doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879 and
		Pimentel (2016), Obs. Studies 2(1):4-23. The rrelaxiv package,
		which provides an alternative solver for the underlying network
		flow problems, carries an academic license and is not available
		on CRAN, but may be downloaded from Github at
		https://github.com/josherrickson/rrelaxiv/.
