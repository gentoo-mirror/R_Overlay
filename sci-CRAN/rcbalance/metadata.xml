		Large, Sparse Optimal Matching with Refined Covariate Balance //
		Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units and
		control units in observational studies.  Provisions are made
		for refined covariate balance constraints, which include fine
		and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are optimal in
		the sense that they are computed as solutions to network
		optimization problems rather than greedy algorithms. See
		Pimentel, et al.(2015) doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879 and
		Pimentel (2016), Obs. Studies 2(1):4-23.  The optmatch package,
		which is useful for running many of the provided functions, may
		be downloaded from Github at
		https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch if not available
		on CRAN.
