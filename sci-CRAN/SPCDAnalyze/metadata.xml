		Design and Analyze Studies using the Sequential Parallel
		Comparison Design // Programs to find the sample size or power
		of studies using the Sequential Parallel Comparison Design
		(SPCD) and programs to analyze such studies. This is a clinical
		trial design where patients initially on placebo who did not
		respond are re-randomized between placebo and active drug in a
		second phase and the results of the two phases are pooled. The
		method of analyzing binary data with this design is described
		in Fava,Evins, Dorer and Schoenfeld(2003)
		doi:10.1159/000069738, and the method of analyzing continuous
		data is described in Chen, Yang, Hung and Wang (2011)
