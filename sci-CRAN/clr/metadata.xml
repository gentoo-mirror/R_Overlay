		Curve Linear Regression via Dimension Reduction // A new
		methodology for linear regression with both curve response and
		curve regressors, which is described in Cho, Goude, Brossat and
		Yao (2013) doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.722900 and (2015)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-18732-7_3. The key idea behind this
		methodology is dimension reduction based on a singular value
		decomposition in a Hilbert space, which reduces the curve
		regression problem to several scalar linear regression
		problems.
