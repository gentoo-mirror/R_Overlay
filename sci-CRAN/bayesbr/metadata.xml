		Beta Regression on a Bayesian Model // Applies the Beta
		regression model in the Bayesian statistical view with the
		possibility of adding a spatial effect in the parameters, the
		Beta regression is used when the response variable is a
		proportion variable, that is, it only accepts values between 0
		and 1. The package 'bayesbr' uses 'rstan' package to build the
		Bayesian statistical models. The main function of the package
		receives as a parameter a form informing the independent
		variable and the co-variables of the model to be made, as
		output it returns a list with the results of the model. For
		more details see Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004)
