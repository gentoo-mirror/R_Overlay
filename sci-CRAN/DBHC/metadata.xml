		Sequence Clustering with Discrete-Output HMMs // Provides an
		implementation of a mixture of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for
		discrete sequence data in the Discrete Bayesian HMM Clustering
		(DBHC) algorithm. The DBHC algorithm is an HMM Clustering
		algorithm that finds a mixture of discrete-output HMMs while
		using heuristics based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
		to search for the optimal number of HMM states and the optimal
		number of clusters.
