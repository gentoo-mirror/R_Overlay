		Ebrahim-Farrington Goodness-of-Fit Test for Logistic Regression
		// Implements the Ebrahim-Farrington goodness-of-fit test for
		logistic regression models, particularly effective for sparse
		data and binary outcomes. This test provides an improved
		alternative to the traditional Hosmer-Lemeshow test by using a
		modified Pearson chi-square statistic with data-dependent
		grouping. The test is based on Farrington (1996) theoretical
		framework but simplified for practical implementation with
		binary data. Includes functions for both the original
		Farrington test (for grouped data) and the new Ebrahim-
		Farrington test (for binary data with automatic grouping). For
		more details see Hosmer (1980) doi:10.1080/03610928008827941
		and Farrington (1996) doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02086.x.
