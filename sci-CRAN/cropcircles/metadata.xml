		Crops an Image to a Circle // Images are cropped to a circle with
		a transparent background. The function takes a vector of
		images, either local or from a link, and circle crops the
		image. Paths to the cropped image are returned for plotting
		with 'ggplot2'. Also includes cropping to a hexagon, heart,
		parallelogram, and square.
