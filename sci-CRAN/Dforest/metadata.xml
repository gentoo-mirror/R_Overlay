		Decision Forest // Provides R-implementation of Decision forest
		algorithm, which combines the predictions of multiple
		independent decision tree models for a consensus decision. In
		particular, Decision Forest is a novel pattern-recognition
		method which can be used to analyze: (1) DNA microarray data;
		(2) Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight
		Mass Spectrometry  (SELDI-TOF-MS) data; and (3) Structure-
		Activity Relation (SAR) data. In this package, three
		fundamental functions are provided, as (1)DF_train, (2)DF_pred,
		and (3)DF_CV. run Dforest() to see more instructions. Weida
