		Another Look at the Acceptance-Rejection Method // In
		mathematics, 'rejection sampling' is a basic technique used to
		generate observations from a distribution. It is also commonly
		called 'the Acceptance-Rejection method' or 'Accept-Reject
		algorithm' and is a type of Monte Carlo method. 'Acceptance-
		Rejection method' is based on the observation that to sample a
		random variable one can perform a uniformly random sampling of
		the 2D cartesian graph, and keep the samples in the region
		under the graph of its density function. Package 'AR' is able
		to generate/simulate random data from a probability density
		function by Acceptance-Rejection method. Moreover, this package
		is a useful teaching resource for graphical presentation of
		Acceptance-Rejection method. From the practical point of view,
		the user needs to calculate a constant in Acceptance-Rejection
		method, which package 'AR' is able to compute this constant by
		optimization tools. Several numerical examples are provided to
		illustrate the graphical presentation for the Acceptance-
		Rejection Method.
