		Cumulative Calibration Assessment for Prediction Models // Tools
		for visualization of, and inference on, the calibration of
		prediction models on the cumulative domain. This provides a
		method for evaluating calibration of risk prediction models
		without having to group the data or use tuning parameters
		(e.g., loess bandwidth). This package implements the
		methodology described in Sadatsafavi and Patkau (2024)
		doi:10.1002/sim.10138. The core of the package is cumulcalib(),
		which takes in vectors of binary responses and predicted risks.
		The plot() and summary() methods are implemented for the
		results returned by cumulcalib().
