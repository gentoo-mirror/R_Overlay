		Analyze Big Files Without Loading Them in Memory // A simple set
		of wrapper functions for data.table::fread() that allows
		subsetting or filtering rows and selecting columns of table-
		formatted files too large for the available RAM. 'b stands for
		'big files'. The package is using Unix commands like grep, cut
		and sed through (hopefully) intuitive parameters. IMPORTANT: On
		Windows environments, you need to have those Unix commands
		available in your "PATH". The easiest way is to install
		"RTools". Alternatively, Git or Cygwin should also work if
		their /bin/ folders are in your Path.
