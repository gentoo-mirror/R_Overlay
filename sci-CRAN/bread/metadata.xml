		Analyze Big Files Without Loading Them in Memory // A simple set
		of wrapper functions for data.table::fread() that allows
		subsetting or filtering rows and selecting columns of table-
		formatted files too large for the available RAM. 'b stands for
		'big files'. The package is using Unix commands like grep, cut
		and sed through (hopefully) intuitive parameters. bread makes
		heavy use of Unix commands like grep, sed, wc and cut. They are
		available by default in all Unix environments. For Windows, you
		need to install those commands externally in order to simulate
		a Unix environment and make sure that the executables are in
		the Windows PATH variable. To my knowledge, the simplest ways
		are to install RTools, Git or Cygwin. If they have been
		correctly installed (with the expected registry entries), they
		should be detected on loading the package and the correct
		directories will be added automatically to the PATH.
