		Statistical Tests and Graphics for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium //
		Contains tools for exploring Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Hardy,
		1908;  Weinberg, 1908) doi:10.1126/science.28.706.49 for bi and
		multi-allelic genetic marker data. All classical tests (chi-
		square, exact, likelihood-ratio and permutation tests) with bi-
		allelic variants are included in the package, as well as
		functions for power computation and for the simulation of
		marker data under equilibrium and disequilibrium. Routines for
		dealing with markers on the X-chromosome are included
		(Graffelman  Weir, 2016) doi: 10.1038/hdy.2016.20, including
		Bayesian procedures. Some exact and permutation procedures also
		work with multi-allelic variants. Special test procedures that
		jointly address Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and equality of
		allele frequencies in both sexes are supplied, for the bi and
		multi-allelic case. Functions for testing equilibrium in the
		presence of missing data by using multiple imputation are also
		provided. Implements several graphics for exploring the
		equilibrium status of a large set of bi-allelic markers:
		ternary plots with acceptance regions, log-ratio plots and Q-Q
		plots.
