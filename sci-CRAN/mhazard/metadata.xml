		Multivariate Survival Function Estimation and Regression //
		Estimates the survival function and Cox regression parameters
		for the multivariate survival setting where there are multiple
		(right-censored) outcome variables. The Volterra, Dabrowska,
		and Prentice-Cai estimates of the bivariate survival function
		may be computed as well as the Dabrowska estimate of the
		trivariate survival function. Bivariate Cox regression
		estimates can also be computed. Functions are also provided to
		compute (bootstrap) confidence intervals and plot the estimates
		of the bivariate survival function. For details, see "The
		Statistical Analysis of Multivariate Failure Time Data: A
		Marginal Modeling Approach", Prentice, R., Zhao, S. (2019,
		ISBN: 978-1-4822-5657-4), CRC Press.
