		Spatial Absorbing Markov Chains // Implements functions for
		working with absorbing Markov chains. The implementation is
		based on the framework described in "Toward a unified framework
		for connectivity that disentangles movement and mortality in
		space and time" by Fletcher et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1111/ele.13333, which applies them to spatial ecology.
		This framework incorporates both resistance and absorption with
		spatial absorbing Markov chains (SAMC) to provide several
		short-term and long-term predictions for metrics related to
		connectivity in landscapes. Despite the ecological context of
		the framework, this package can be used in any application of
		absorbing Markov chains.
