		Two-Steps Benchmarks for Time Series Disaggregation // The
		twoStepsBenchmark() function and its wrappers allow you to
		disaggregate a low frequency time serie with time series of
		higher frequency, using the French National Accounts
		methodology. The aggregated sum of the resulting time-serie is
		strictly equal to the low-frequency serie within the
		benchmarking window. Typically, the low frequency serie is an
		annual one, unknown for the last year, and the high frequency
		is either quarterly or mensual. See "Methodology of quarterly
		national accounts", Insee Mthodes N126, by Insee (2012,
		ISBN:978-2-11-068613-8).
