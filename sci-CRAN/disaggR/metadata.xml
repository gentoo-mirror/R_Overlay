		Two-Steps Benchmarks for Time Series Disaggregation // The
		twoStepsBenchmark() and threeRuleSmooth() functions allow you
		to disaggregate a low-frequency time series with higher
		frequency time series, using the French National Accounts
		methodology. The aggregated sum of the resulting time series is
		strictly equal to the low-frequency time series within the
		benchmarking window. Typically, the low-frequency time series
		is an annual one, unknown for the last year, and the high
		frequency one is either quarterly or monthly. See "Methodology
		of quarterly national accounts", Insee Mthodes N126, by Insee
		(2012, ISBN:978-2-11-068613-8,
		https://www.insee.fr/en/information/2579410).
