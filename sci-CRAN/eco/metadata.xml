		Ecological Inference in 2x2 Tables // Implements the Bayesian and
		likelihood methods proposed in Imai, Lu, and Strauss (2008 DOI:
		10.1093/pan/mpm017) and (2011 DOI:10.18637/jss.v042.i05) for
		ecological inference in 2 by 2 tables as well as the method of
		bounds introduced by Duncan and Davis (1953).  The package fits
		both parametric and nonparametric models using either the
		Expectation-Maximization algorithms (for likelihood models) or
		the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (for Bayesian models).
		For all models, the individual-level data can be directly
		incorporated into the estimation whenever such data are
		available. Along with in-sample and out-of-sample predictions,
		the package also provides a functionality which allows one to
		quantify the effect of data aggregation on parameter estimation
		and hypothesis testing under the parametric likelihood models.
