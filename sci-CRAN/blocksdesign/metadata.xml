		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial and Unstructured
		Treatment Sets // Constructs D-optimal or near D-optimal
		treatment and block designs for linear treatment models with
		crossed or nested block factors. The treatment design can be
		any arbitrary linear model defined by a treatment model formula
		and the block design can be any feasible combination of crossed
		or nested block factors. The block design factors are optimized
		sequentially and the levels of each successive block factor are
		optimized within the levels of each preceding block factor.
		Crossed block designs with non-singular interaction effects are
		optimized using a weighting scheme that allows for differential
		weighting of first and second-order block effects. Outputs
		include a table showing the allocation of treatments to blocks
		and tables showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for each
		block and treatment design.
