		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Unstructured and Factorial
		Treatment Sets // Constructs randomized nested row-and-column
		type block designs with arbitrary depth of nesting for
		arbitrary factorial or fractional factorial treatment designs.
		The treatment model can be defined by a models.matrix formula
		which allows any feasible combination of quantitative or
		qualitative model terms. Any feasible design size can be
		defined and, where necessary, a D-optimal swapping routine will
		find the best fraction for the required design size. Blocks are
		nested hierarchically in successive strata and the blocks model
		in any particular stratum will comprise either a simple nested
		blocks design or a crossed row-and-column blocks design. Block
		sizes in any one stratum are either all equal or differ, at
		most, by one plot. The design outputs include a data frame
		showing the allocation of treatments to blocks, a table showing
		block levels, the fractional design efficiency, the achieved
		D-efficiency, the achieved A-efficiency (unstructured
		treatments only) and A-efficiency upper bounds, where
		available, for each stratum in the design. For designs with
		simple unstructured treatments, a plan layout showing the
		allocation of treatments to blocks or to rows and columns in
		the bottom stratum of the design is also given.
