		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial and Unstructured
		Treatment Sets // Constructs treatment and block designs for
		linear treatment models with crossed or nested block factors.
		The treatment design can be any feasible linear model and the
		block design can be any feasible combination of crossed or
		nested block factors. The block design is a sum of one or more
		block factors and the block design is optimized sequentially
		with the levels of each successive block factor optimized
		conditional on all previously optimized block factors.
		D-optimality is used throughout except for square or
		rectangular lattice block designs which are constructed
		algebraically using mutually orthogonal Latin squares. Crossed
		block designs with interaction effects are optimized using a
		weighting scheme which allows for differential weighting of
		first and second-order block effects. Outputs include a table
		showing the allocation of treatments to blocks and tables
		showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block and
		treatment design. Edmondson, R.N. Multi-level Block Designs for
