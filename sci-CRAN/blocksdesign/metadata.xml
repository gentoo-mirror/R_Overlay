		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial, Fractional
		Factorial and Unstructured Treatment Sets // Constructs
		D-optimal or near D-optimal nested and crossed block designs
		for unstructured or general factorial treatment designs. The
		treatment design, if required, is found from a model matrix
		design formula and can be added sequentially, if required. The
		block design is found from a defined set of block factors and
		is conditional on the defined treatment design. The block
		factors are added in sequence and each added block factor is
		optimized conditional on all previously added block factors.
		The block design can have repeated nesting down to any required
		depth of nesting with either simple nested blocks or crossed
		blocks at each level of nesting. Outputs include a table
		showing the allocation of treatments to blocks and tables
		showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block and
		treatment design.
