		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial, Fractional
		Factorial and Unstructured Treatment Sets // Constructs
		randomized nested row-and-column type block designs with
		arbitrary depth of nesting for arbitrary factorial or
		fractional factorial treatment designs. The treatment model can
		be defined by a models.matrix formula which allows any feasible
		combination of quantitative or qualitative model terms. Any
		feasible design size can be defined and, where necessary, a
		D-optimal swapping routine will find the best fraction for the
		required design size. Blocks are nested hierarchically and the
		block model for any particular level of nesting can comprise
		either a simple nested blocks design or a crossed row-and-
		column blocks design. Block sizes are either all equal or
		differ, at most, by one plot within any particular row or
		column classification and any particular level of nesting. The
		design outputs include a data frame showing the allocation of
		treatments to blocks, a table showing block levels, the
		fractional design efficiency, the achieved D-efficiency, the
		achieved A-efficiency (unstructured treatments only) and
		A-efficiency upper bounds, where available, for each stratum in
		the design. For designs with simple unstructured treatments, a
		plan layout showing the allocation of treatments to blocks or
		to rows and columns in the bottom stratum of the design is also
		given.
