		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial, Fractional
		Factorial and Unstructured Treatment Sets // The 'blocksdesign'
		package constructs nested block and D-optimal factorial designs
		for any unstructured or factorial treatment model of any size.
		The nested block designs can have repeated nesting down to any
		required depth of nesting with either a simple set of nested
		blocks or a crossed row-and-column blocks design at each level
		of nesting. The block design at each level of nesting is
		optimized for D-efficiency within the blocks of each preceding
		set of blocks. Outputs include a table showing the allocation
		of treatments to blocks, a plan layout showing the allocation
		of treatments within blocks (unstructured treatment designs
		only) the achieved D-efficiency factors for the block and
		treatment design (factorial treatment designs only) and, where
		feasible, an A-efficiency factor and A-efficiency upper bound
		for the block design (unstructured treatment designs only).
