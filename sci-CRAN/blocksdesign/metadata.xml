		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial, Fractional
		Factorial and Unstructured Treatment Sets // Constructs
		D-optimal or near D-optimal nested and crossed block designs
		for unstructured or general factorial treatment designs. Where
		a structured treatment design is required, a D-optimal or near
		D-optimal treatment design is found based on a suitable model
		matrix design formula. The required block design is then found
		for the required treatment design based on a defined set of
		block factors. The block factors are added in sequence and each
		added block factor is optimized conditional on all previously
		added block factors. The block design can have repeated nesting
		down to any required depth of nesting with either simple nested
		blocks or a crossed blocks design at each level of nesting.
		Outputs include a table showing the allocation of treatments to
		blocks and tables showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for
		each block and treatment design.
