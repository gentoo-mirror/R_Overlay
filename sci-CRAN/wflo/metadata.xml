		Data Set and Helper Functions for Wind Farm Layout Optimization
		Problems // Provides a convenient data set, a set of helper
		functions, and a benchmark function for economically (profit)
		driven wind farm layout optimization. This enables researchers
		in the field of the NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time
		hard) problem of wind farm layout optimization to focus on
		their optimization methodology contribution and also provides a
		realistic benchmark setting for comparability among
		contributions.
