		A Consistent and Intuitive Platform to Explore the Dependencies
		of Packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network Like
		Repositories // Interactively explore various dependencies of a
		package(s) (on the Comprehensive R Archive Network Like
		repositories) and perform analysis using tidy philosophy. Most
		of the functions return a 'tibble' object (enhancement of
		'dataframe') which can be used for further analysis. The
		package offers functions to produce 'network' and 'igraph'
		dependency graphs. The 'plot' method produces a static plot
		based on 'ggnetwork' and 'plotd3' function produces an
		interactive D3 plot based on 'networkD3'.
