		Compression and Decompression // The 'zlib' package for R aims to
		offer an R-based equivalent of 'Python's' built-in 'zlib'
		module for data compression and decompression. This package
		provides a suite of functions for working with 'zlib'
		compression, including utilities for compressing and
		decompressing data streams, manipulating compressed files, and
		working with 'gzip', 'zlib', and 'deflate' formats.
