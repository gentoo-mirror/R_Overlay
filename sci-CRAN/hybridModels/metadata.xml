		An R Package for the Stochastic Simulation of Disease Spreading
		in Dynamic Networks // Simulates stochastic hybrid models for
		transmission of infectious diseases in dynamic networks. It is
		a metapopulation model in which each node in the network is a
		sub-population and disease spreads within nodes and among them,
		combining two approaches: stochastic simulation algorithm
		(doi:10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104637) and individual-
		based approach, respectively. Equations that models spread
		within nodes are customizable and there are two link types
		among nodes: migration and influence (commuting). More
		information in Fernando S. Marques, Jose H. H. Grisi-Filho,
		Marcos Amaku et al. (2020) doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i06.
