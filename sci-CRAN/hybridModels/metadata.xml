		Stochastic Hybrid Models in Dynamic Networks // Simulates
		stochastic hybrid models for transmission of infectious
		diseases in dynamic networks. It is a metapopulation model in
		which each node in the network is a sub-population and disease
		spreads within nodes and among them, combining two approaches:
		stochastic simulation algorithm or its approximations
		(Gillespie DT (2007)
		doi:10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104637) and individual-
		based approach, respectively. Movement among nodes are data
		based and can be irregular. Equations that models spread within
		nodes are customizable and there are two link types among
		nodes: migration and influence (commuting).
