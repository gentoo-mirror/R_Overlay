		Greedy Experimental Design Construction // Computes experimental
		designs for a two-arm experiment with covariates via a number
		of methods. (0) complete randomization and randomization with
		forced-balance. (1) Greedily optimizing a balance objective
		function via pairwise switching. This optimization provides
		lower variance for the treatment effect estimator (and higher
		power) while preserving a design that is close to complete
		randomization. We return all iterations of the designs for use
		in a permutation test. (2) The second is via numerical
		optimization (via 'gurobi' which must be installed, see https:/
		/www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_windows/r_ins_the_
		r_package.html) a la Bertsimas and Kallus. (3) rerandomization,
		(4) Karp's method for one covariate, (5) exhaustive enumeration
		to find the optimal solution (only for small sample sizes) (6)
		Binary pair matching using the 'nbpMatching' library (7) Binary
		pair matching plus (1) to further optimize balance (8) Binary
		pair matching plus (3) to further optimize balance (9) Hadamard
		designs We also allow for three objective functions:
		Mahalanobis distance, Sum of absolute differences standardized
		and Kernel distances via the 'kernlab' library.
