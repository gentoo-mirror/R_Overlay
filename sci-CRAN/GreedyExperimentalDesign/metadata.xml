		Greedy Experimental Design Construction // Computes experimental
		designs for a two-arm experiment with covariates via a number
		of methods: (0) complete randomization and randomization with
		forced-balance, (1) Greedily optimizing a balance objective
		function via pairwise switching. This optimization provides
		lower variance for the treatment effect estimator (and higher
		power) while preserving a design that is close to complete
		randomization. We return all iterations of the designs for use
		in a permutation test, (2) The second is via numerical
		optimization (via 'gurobi' which must be installed, see https:/
		/www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_windows/r_ins_the_
		r_package.html) a la Bertsimas and Kallus, (3) rerandomization,
		(4) Karp's method for one covariate, (5) exhaustive enumeration
		to find the optimal solution (only for small sample sizes), (6)
		Binary pair matching using the 'nbpMatching' library, (7)
		Binary pair matching plus design number (1) to further optimize
		balance, (8) Binary pair matching plus design number (3) to
		further optimize balance, (9) Hadamard designs, (10)
		Simultaneous Multiple Kernels. In (1-9) we allow for three
		objective functions: Mahalanobis distance, Sum of absolute
		differences standardized and Kernel distances via the 'kernlab'
		library. This package is the result of a stream of research
		that can be found in Krieger, A, Azriel, D and Kapelner, A
		"Nearly Random Designs with Greatly Improved Balance" (2016)
		arXiv:1612.02315, Krieger, A, Azriel, D and Kapelner, A "Better
		Experimental Design by Hybridizing Binary Matching with
		Imbalance Optimization" (2021) arXiv:2012.03330.
