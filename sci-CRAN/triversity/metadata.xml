		Diversity Measures on Tripartite Graphs // Computing diversity
		measures on tripartite graphs. This package first implements a
		parametrized family of such diversity measures which apply on
		probability distributions. Sometimes called "True Diversity",
		this family contains famous measures such as the richness, the
		Shannon entropy, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and the
		Berger-Parker index. Second, the package allows to apply these
		measures on probability distributions resulting from random
		walks between the levels of tripartite graphs. By defining an
		initial distribution at a given level of the graph and a path
		to follow between the three levels, the probability of the
		walker's position within the final level is then computed, thus
		providing a particular instance of diversity to measure.
