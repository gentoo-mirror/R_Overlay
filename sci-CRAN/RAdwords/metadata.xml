		Loading Google Adwords Data into R // Aims at loading Google
		Adwords data into R. Adwords is an online advertising service
		that enables advertisers to display advertising copy to web
		users (see https://developers.google.com/adwords/ for more
		information). Therefore the package implements three main
		features. First, the package provides an authentication process
		for R with the Google Adwords API (see
		https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/ for more
		information) via OAUTH2. Second, the package offers an
		interface to apply the Adwords query language in R and query
		the Adwords API with ad-hoc reports. Third, the received data
		are transformed into suitable data formats for further data
		processing and data analysis.
