		Fuzzy Similarity in Species Distributions // Functions to compute
		fuzzy versions of species occurrence patterns based on
		presence-absence data (including inverse distance
		interpolation, trend surface analysis, and prevalence-
		independent favourability obtained from probability of
		presence), as well as pair-wise fuzzy similarity (based on
		fuzzy logic versions of commonly used similarity indices) among
		those occurrence patterns. Includes also functions for model
		consensus and comparison (overlap and fuzzy similarity, loss or
		gain), and for data preparation, such as obtaining unique
		abbreviations of species names, cleaning and gridding
		(thinning) point occurrence data onto raster maps, selecting
		absences under specified criteria, converting species lists
		(long format) to presence-absence tables (wide format),
		transposing part of a data frame, selecting relevant variables
		for models, assessing the false discovery rate, or analysing
		and dealing with multicollinearity. Initially described in
		Barbosa (2015) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12372.
