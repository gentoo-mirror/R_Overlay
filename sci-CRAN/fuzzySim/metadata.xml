		Fuzzy Similarity in Species Distributions // Functions to
		calculate fuzzy versions of species' occurrence patterns based
		on presence-absence data (including inverse distance
		interpolation, trend surface analysis and prevalence-
		independent favourability GLM), and pair-wise fuzzy similarity
		(based on fuzzy versions of commonly used similarity indices)
		among those occurrence patterns. Includes also functions for
		model comparison (overlap and fuzzy similarity, loss or gain),
		and for data preparation, such as obtaining unique
		abbreviations of species names, converting species lists (long
		format) to presence-absence tables (wide format), transposing
		part of a data frame, assessing the false discovery rate, or
		analysing and dealing with multicollinearity among variables.
		Includes also sample datasets for providing practical examples.
