		Genome Scans to Accommodate and Target Genetic and Non-Genetic
		Effects on Trait Variance // In recognition that there are many
		factors (genetic loci, macro-genetic factors such as sex, and
		environmental factors) that influence the environmental
		variation, the 'vqtl' package conducts genome scans that
		accommodate and target these factors.  The main functions of
		this package, scanonevar() and scanonevar.perm() take as input
		a cross object from the popular 'qtl' package.
