		Genome Scans to Accommodate and Target Genetic and Non-Genetic
		Effects on Trait Variance in Test Crosses // In recognition
		that there are many factors (genetic loci, macro- genetic
		factors such as sex, and environmental factors) that influence
		the extent of environmental variation, the 'vqtl' package
		conducts genome scans that accommodate and target these
		factors. The main functions of this package, scanonevar() and
		scanonevar.perm() take as input a cross object from the popular
		'qtl' package.
