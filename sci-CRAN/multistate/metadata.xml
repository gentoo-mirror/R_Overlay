		Fitting Multistate Models // Medical researchers are often
		interested in investigating the relationship between
		explicative variables and multiple times-to-event. Time-
		inhomogeneous Markov models consist of modelling the
		probabilities of transitions according to the chronological
		times (times since the baseline of the study). Semi-Markov (SM)
		models consist of modelling the probabilities of transitions
		according to the times spent in states. In this package, we
		propose functions implementing such 3-state and 4-state
		multivariable and multistate models. The user can introduce
		multiple covariates to estimate conditional (subject-specific)
		effects. We also propose to adjust for possible confounding
		factors by using the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW). When
		a state is patient death, the user can consider to take into
		account the mortality of the general population (relative
		survival approach). Finally, in the particular situation of one
		initial transient state and two competing and absorbing states,
		this package allows for estimating mixture models.
