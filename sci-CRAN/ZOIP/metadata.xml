		ZOIP Distribution, ZOIP Regression, ZOIP Mixed Regression // The
		ZOIP distribution (Zeros Ones Inflated Proportional) is a
		proportional data distribution inflated with zeros and/or ones,
		this distribution is defined on the most known proportional
		data distributions, the beta and simplex distribution, Jrgensen
		and Barndorff-Nielsen (1991) doi:10.1016/0047-259X(91)90008-P,
		also allows it to have different parameterizations of the beta
		distribution, Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004)
		doi:10.1080/0266476042000214501, Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i07. The ZOIP distribution has four
		parameters, two of which correspond to the proportion of zeros
		and ones, and the other two correspond to the distribution of
		the proportional data of your choice. The 'ZOIP' package allows
		adjustments of regression models for fixed and mixed effects
		for proportional data inflated with zeros and/or ones.
