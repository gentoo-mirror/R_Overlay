		Multiscale Change-Point Inference // Allows fitting of step-
		functions to univariate serial data where neither the number of
		jumps nor their positions is known by implementing the
		multiscale regression estimators SMUCE and HSMUCE. In addition,
		confidence intervals for the change-point locations and bands
		for the unknown signal can be obtained.
