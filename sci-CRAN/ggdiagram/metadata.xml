		Object-Oriented Diagram Plots with 'ggplot2' // Creates diagrams
		with an object-oriented approach. Geometric objects have
		computed properties with information about themselves (e.g.,
		their area) or about their relationships with other objects
		(e.g, the distance between their edges). The objects have
		methods to convert them to geoms that can be plotted in
		'ggplot2'.
