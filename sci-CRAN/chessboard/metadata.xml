		Create Network Connections Based on Chess Moves // Provides
		functions to work with directed (asymmetric) and undirected
		(symmetric) spatial networks. It makes the creation of
		connectivity matrices easier, i.e. a binary matrix of dimension
		n x n, where n is the number of nodes (sampling units)
		indicating the presence (1) or the absence (0) of an edge
		(link) between pairs of nodes. Different network objects can be
		produced by 'chessboard': node list, neighbor list, edge list,
		connectivity matrix. It can also produce objects that will be
		used later in Moran's Eigenvector Maps (Dray et al. (2006)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.02.015) and Asymetric Eigenvector
		Maps (Blanchet et al. (2008)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2008.04.001), methods available in the
		package 'adespatial' (Dray et al. (2023)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=adespatial). This work is
		part of the FRB-CESAB working group Bridge
		https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-
		action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bridge/.
