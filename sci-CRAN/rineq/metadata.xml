		Concentration Index and Decomposition for Health Inequalities //
		Relative, generalized, and Erreygers corrected concentration
		index; plot Lorenz curves; and decompose health inequalities
		into contributing factors. The package currently works with
		(generalized) linear models, survival models, complex survey
		models, and marginal effects probit models. originally forked
		by Brecht Devleesschauwer from the 'decomp' package  (no longer
		on CRAN), 'rineq' is now maintained by Kaspar Walter Meili.
		Compared to the earlier 'rineq' version on 'github' by Brecht
		Devleesschauwer (https://github.com/brechtdv/rineq), the
		regression tree functionality has been removed. Improvements
		compared to earlier versions include improved plotting of
		decomposition and concentration, added functionality to
		calculate the concentration index with different methods,
		calculation of robust standard errors, and support for the
		decomposition analysis using marginal effects probit regression
		models. The development version is available at
		https://github.com/kdevkdev/rineq.
