		Leland Wilkinson's Algorithm for Detecting Multidimensional
		Outliers // An implementation of an algorithm for outlier
		detection that can handle a) data with a mixed categorical and
		continuous variables, b) many columns of data, c) many rows of
		data, d) outliers that mask other outliers, and e) both
		unidimensional and multidimensional datasets. Unlike ad hoc
		methods found in many machine learning papers, HDoutliers is
		based on a distributional model that uses probabilities to
		determine outliers.
