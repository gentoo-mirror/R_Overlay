		Bounds on Distributional Treatment Effect Parameters // The joint
		distribution of potential outcomes is not typically identified
		under standard identifying assumptions such as selection on
		observables or even when individuals are randomly assigned to
		being treated. This package contains methods for obtaining
		tight bounds on distributional treatment effect parameters when
		panel data is available and under a Copula Stability Assumption
		as in Callaway (2017) https://ssrn.com/abstract=3028251.
