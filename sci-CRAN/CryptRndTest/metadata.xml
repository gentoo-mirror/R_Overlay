		Statistical Tests for Cryptographic Randomness // Performs
		cryptographic randomness tests on a sequence of random integers
		or bits. Included tests are greatest common divisor, birthday
		spacings, book stack, adaptive chi-square, topological binary,
		and three random walk tests. Tests except greatest common
		divisor and birthday spacings are not covered by standard test
		suites. In addition to the chi-square goodness-of-fit test,
		results of Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Jarque-
		Bera tests are also generated by some of the cryptographic
		randomness tests.
