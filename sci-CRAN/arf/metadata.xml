		Adversarial Random Forests // Adversarial random forests (ARFs)
		recursively partition data into fully factorized leaves, where
		features are jointly independent. The procedure is iterative,
		with alternating rounds of generation and discrimination. Data
		becomes increasingly realistic at each round, until original
		and synthetic samples can no longer be reliably distinguished.
		This is useful for several unsupervised learning tasks, such as
		density estimation and data synthesis. Methods for both are
		implemented in this package. ARFs naturally handle unstructured
		data with mixed continuous and categorical covariates. They
		inherit many of the benefits of random forests, including
		speed, flexibility, and solid performance with default
		parameters. For details, see Watson et al. (2023)
