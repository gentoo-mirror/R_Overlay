		Multi-States Semi-Markov Models // Functions for fitting multi-
		state semi-Markov models to longitudinal data. A parametric
		maximum likelihood estimation method adapted to deal with
		Exponential, Weibull and Exponentiated Weibull distributions is
		considered. Right-censoring can be taken into account and both
		constant and time-varying covariates can be included using a
		Cox proportional model.
