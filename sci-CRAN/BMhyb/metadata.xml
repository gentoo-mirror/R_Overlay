		Comparative Methods for Phylogenetic Networks // Analyze the
		phenotypic evolution of species of hybrid origin on a
		phylogenetic network. This can detect a burst of variation at
		the formation of a hybrid as well as an increase or decrease in
		trait value at a hybridization event. Parameters are estimated
		by maximum likelihood, and model averaging can be done
		automatically. Users need to enter a comparative data set and a
		phylogenetic network.
