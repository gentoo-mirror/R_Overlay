		Hybrid Trait Evolution under Brownian Motion // Analyzes the
		phenotypic evolution of species of hybrid origin on a
		phylogenetic network. This package can detect the hybrid vigor
		effect, a burst of variation at formation, and the relative
		portion of heritability from its parents. Parameters are
		estimated by maximum likelihood. Users need to enter a
		comparative data set, a phylogeny, and information on gene flow
		leading to hybrids. See Jhwueng and O'Meara (2017)
