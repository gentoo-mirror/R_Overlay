		Adaptable Regularized Hotelling's T^2 Test for High-Dimensional
		Data // Perform the Adaptable Regularized Hotelling's T^2 test
		(ARHT) proposed by Li et al., (2016) arXiv:1609.08725. Both
		one-sample and two-sample mean test are available with various
		probabilistic alternative prior models. It contains a function
		to consistently estimate higher order moments of the population
		covariance spectral distribution using the spectral of the
		sample covariance matrix (Bai et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-842X.2010.00590.x). In addition, it contains
		a function to sample from 3-variate chi-squared random vectors
		approximately with a given correlation matrix when the degrees
		of freedom are large.
