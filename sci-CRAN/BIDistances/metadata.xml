		Bioinformatic Distances // A few high-performant methods for
		computing distances measures for bioinformatics data. The
		weighted euclidean distance can be computed with 'OpenCL' on
		the GPU or with a parallelized version on the CPU. Other
		important distance measures for bioinformatics data are
		selected from the R package 'parallelDist'. A special distance
		measure for the Gene Ontology is available.
