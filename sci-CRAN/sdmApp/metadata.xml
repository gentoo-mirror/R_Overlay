		A User-Friendly Application for Species Distribution Modeling //
		A 'shiny' application that allows non-expert 'R' users to
		easily model species distribution. It offers a reproducible
		work flow for species distribution modeling into a single and
		user friendly environment. 'sdmApp' takes 'raster' data (in
		format supported by the 'raster package') and species
		occurrence data (several format supported) as input argument.
		It provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).
