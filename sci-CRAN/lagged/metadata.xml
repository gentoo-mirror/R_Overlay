		Classes and Methods for Lagged Objects // Provides classes and
		methods for objects, whose indexing naturally starts from zero.
		Subsetting, indexing and mathematical operations are defined
		naturally between lagged objects and lagged and base R objects.
		Recycling is not used, except for singletons. The single
		bracket operator doesn't drop dimensions by default.
