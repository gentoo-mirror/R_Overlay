		Directional Highest Density Regions // We provide an R tool for
		computation and nonparametric plug-in estimation of Highest
		Density Regions (HDRs) and general level sets in the
		directional setting. Concretely, circular and spherical HDRs
		can be reconstructed from a data sample following Saavedra-
		Nieves and Crujeiras (2021) doi:10.1007/s11634-021-00457-4.
		This library also contains two real datasets in the circular
		and spherical settings. The first one concerns a problem from
		animal orientation studies and the second one is related to
		earthquakes occurrences.
