		Directional Highest Density Regions // We provide an R tool for
		nonparametric plug-in estimation of Highest Density Regions
		(HDRs) in the directional setting. Concretely, circular and
		spherical regions can be reconstructed from a data sample
		following Saavedra-Nieves and Crujeiras (2020)
		arXiv:2009.08915. This library also contains two real datasets
		in the circular and spherical settings. The first one concerns
		a problem from animal orientation studies and the second one is
		related to earthquakes occurrences.
