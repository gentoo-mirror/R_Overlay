		Bayesian Bootstrap Predictive Mean Matching - Multiple and Single
		Imputation for Discrete Data // Included are two variants of
		Bayesian Bootstrap Predictive Mean Matching to multiply impute
		missing data. The first variant is a variable-by-variable
		imputation combining sequential regression and Predictive Mean
		Matching (PMM) that has been extended for unordered categorical
		data. The Bayesian Bootstrap allows for generating
		approximately proper multiple imputations. The second variant
		is also based on PMM, but the focus is on imputing several
		variables at the same time. The suggestion is to use this
		variant, if the missing-data pattern resembles a data fusion
		situation, or any other missing-by-design pattern, where
		several variables have identical missing-data patterns. Both
		variants can be run as 'single imputation' versions, in case
		the analysis objective is of a purely descriptive nature.
