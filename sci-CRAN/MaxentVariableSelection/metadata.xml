		Selecting the Best Set of Relevant Environmental Variables along
		with the Optimal Regularization Multiplier for Maxent Niche
		Modeling // Complex niche models show low performance in
		identifying the most important range-limiting environmental
		variables and in transferring habitat suitability to novel
		environmental conditions (Warren and Seifert, 2011
		DOI:10.1890/10-1171.1; Warren et al., 2014
		DOI:10.1111/ddi.12160). This package helps to identify the most
		important set of uncorrelated variables and to fine-tune
		Maxent's regularization multiplier. In combination, this allows
		to constrain complexity and increase performance of Maxent
		niche models (assessed by information criteria, such as AICc
		(Akaike, 1974 DOI:10.1109/TAC.1974.1100705), and by the area
		under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) (Fielding and
		Bell, 1997 DOI:10.1017/S0376892997000088). Users of this
		package should be familiar with Maxent niche modelling.
