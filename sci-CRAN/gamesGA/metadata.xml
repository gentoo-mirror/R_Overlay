		Genetic Algorithm for Sequential Symmetric Games // Finds
		adaptive strategies for sequential symmetric games using a
		genetic algorithm. Currently, any symmetric two by two matrix
		is allowed, and strategies can remember the history of an
		opponent's play from the previous three rounds of moves in
		iterated interactions between players. The genetic algorithm
		returns a list of adaptive strategies given payoffs, and the
		mean fitness of strategies in each generation.
