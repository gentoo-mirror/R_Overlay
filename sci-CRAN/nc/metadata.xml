		Named Capture to Data Tables // User-friendly functions for
		extracting a data table (row for each match, column for each
		group) from non-tabular text data using regular expressions,
		and for melting columns that match a regular expression.
		Patterns are defined using a readable syntax that makes it easy
		to build complex patterns in terms of simpler, re-usable sub-
		patterns. Named R arguments are translated to column names in
		the output; capture groups without names are used internally in
		order to provide a standard interface to three regular
		expression C libraries (PCRE, RE2, ICU). Output can also
		include numeric columns via user-specified type conversion
		functions.
