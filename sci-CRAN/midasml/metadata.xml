		Estimation and Prediction Methods for High-Dimensional Mixed
		Frequency Time Series Data // The 'midasml' estimation and
		prediction methods for high dimensional time series regression
		models under mixed data sampling data structures using
		structured-sparsity penalties and orthogonal polynomials. For
		more information on the 'midasml' approach see Babii, Ghysels,
		and Striaukas (2021, JBES forthcoming)
		doi:10.1080/07350015.2021.1899933. Functions that compute MIDAS
		data structures were inspired by MIDAS 'Matlab' toolbox (v2.3)
		written by Eric Ghysels.
