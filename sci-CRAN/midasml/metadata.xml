		Estimation and Prediction Methods for High-Dimensional Mixed
		Frequency Time Series Data // The 'midasml' package implements
		estimation and prediction methods for high-dimensional mixed-
		frequency (MIDAS) time-series and panel data regression models.
		The regularized MIDAS models are estimated using orthogonal
		(e.g. Legendre) polynomials and sparse-group LASSO (sg-LASSO)
		estimator. For more information on the 'midasml' approach see
		Babii, Ghysels, and Striaukas (2021, JBES forthcoming)
		doi:10.1080/07350015.2021.1899933. The package is equipped with
		the fast implementation of the sg-LASSO estimator by means of
		proximal block coordinate descent. High-dimensional mixed
		frequency time-series data can also be easily manipulated with
		functions provided in the package.
