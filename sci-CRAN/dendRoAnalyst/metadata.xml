		A Complete Tool for Processing and Analyzing Dendrometer Data //
		There are various functions for managing and cleaning data
		before the application of different approaches. This includes
		identifying and erasing sudden jumps in dendrometer data not
		related to environmental change, identifying the time gaps of
		recordings, and changing the temporal resolution of data to
		different frequencies. Furthermore, the package calculates
		daily statistics of dendrometer data, including the daily
		amplitude of tree growth. Various approaches can be applied to
		separate radial growth from daily cyclic shrinkage and
		expansion due to uptake and loss of stem water. In addition, it
		identifies periods of consecutive days with user-defined
		climatic conditions in daily meteorological data, then check
		what trees are doing during that period.
