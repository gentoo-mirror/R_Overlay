		Statistical Inference and Sure Independence Screening via Ball
		Statistics // Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening
		(SIS) procedure based on ball statistics, including ball
		divergence doi:10.1214/17-AOS1579, ball covariance, and ball
		correlation doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1462709, are developed to
		analyze complex data. The ball divergence and ball covariance
		based distribution-free tests are implemented to detecting
		distribution difference and association in metric spaces
		arXiv:1811.03750. Furthermore, a generic non-parametric SIS
		procedure based on ball correlation and all of its variants are
		implemented to tackle the challenge in the context of ultra
		high dimensional data.
