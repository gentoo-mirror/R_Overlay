		Statistical Inference and Sure Independence Screening via Ball
		Statistics // Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening
		(SIS) procedure based on ball statistics, including ball
		divergence doi:10.1214/17-AOS1579, ball covariance
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1543600, and ball correlation
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1462709, are developed to analyze
		complex data in metric spaces, e.g, shape, directional,
		compositional and symmetric positive definite matrix data. The
		ball divergence and ball covariance based distribution-free
		tests are implemented to detecting distribution difference and
		association in metric spaces doi:10.18637/jss.v097.i06.
		Furthermore, several generic non-parametric feature selection
		procedures based on ball correlation, BCor-SIS and all of its
		variants, are implemented to tackle the challenge in the
		context of ultra high dimensional data. A fast implementation
		for large-scale multiple K-sample testing with ball divergence
		doi: 10.1002/gepi.22423 is supported, which is particularly
		helpful for genome-wide association study.
