		Statistical Inference and Sure Independence Screening via Ball
		Statistics // Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening
		(SIS) procedure based on ball statistics, including ball
		divergence, ball covariance, and ball correlation, are
		developed to analyze complex data. The ball divergence and ball
		covariance based distribution-free tests are implemented to
		examine equality of multivariate distributions and independence
		between random vectors of arbitrary dimensions. Furthermore, a
		generic non-parametric SIS procedure based on ball correlation
		and all of its variants are implemented to tackle the challenge
		in the context of ultra high dimensional data.
