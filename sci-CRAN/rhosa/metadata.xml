		Higher-Order Spectral Analysis // Higher-order spectra or
		polyspectra of time series, such as bispectrum and bicoherence,
		have been investigated in abundant literature and applied to
		problems of signal detection in a wide range of fields. This
		package aims to provide a simple API to estimate and analyze
		them. The current implementation is based on Brillinger and
		Irizarry (1998) doi:10.1016/S0165-1684(97)00217-X for
		estimating bispectrum or bicoherence, Lii and Helland (1981)
		doi:10.1145/355958.355961 for cross-bispectrum, and Kim and
		Powers (1979) doi:10.1109/TPS.1979.4317207 for cross-
		bicoherence.
