		A Monte Carlo Valuation Framework for Variable Annuities //
		Implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation engine for valuing
		synthetic portfolios of variable annuities, which reflect
		realistic features of common annuity contracts in practice. It
		aims to facilitate the development and dissemination of
		research related to the efficient valuation of a portfolio of
		large variable annuities. The main valuation methodology was
		proposed by Gan (2017) doi:10.1515/demo-2017-0021.
