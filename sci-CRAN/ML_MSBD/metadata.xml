		Maximum Likelihood Inference on Multi-State Trees // Inference of
		a multi-states birth-death model from a phylogeny, comprising a
		number of states N, birth and death rates for each state and on
		which edges each state appears. Inference is done using a
		hybrid approach: states are progressively added in a greedy
		approach. For a fixed number of states N the best model is
		selected via maximum likelihood. Reference: J. Barido-Sottani
		and T. Stadler (2017) doi:10.1101/215491.
