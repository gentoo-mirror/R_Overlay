		A Collection of DIF Tests for Multistage Tests // A collection of
		statistical tests for the detection of differential item
		functioning (DIF) in multistage tests. Methods entail logistic
		regression, an adaptation of the simultaneous item bias test
		(SIBTEST), and various score-based tests. The presented tests
		provide itemwise test for DIF along categorical, ordinal or
		metric covariates. Methods for uniform and non-uniform DIF
		effects are available depending on which method is used.
