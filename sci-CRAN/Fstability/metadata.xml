		Calculate Feature Stability // Has two functions to help with
		calculating feature selection stability. 'Lump' is a function
		that groups subset vectors into a dataframe, and adds NA to
		shorter vectors so they all have the same length. 'ASM' is a
		function that takes a dataframe of subset vectors and the
		original vector of features as inputs, and calculates the
		Stability of the feature selection. The calculation for 'asm'
		uses the Adjusted Stability Measure proposed in: 'Lustgarten',
		'Gopalakrishnan',  'Visweswaran'
