		Genetic Tools for Colony Management // Provides genetic tools for
		colony management and is a derivation of the work in Amanda
		Vinson and Michael J Raboin (2015)
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4671785/ "A
		Practical Approach for Designing Breeding Groups to Maximize
		Genetic Diversity in a Large Colony of Captive Rhesus Macaques
		('Macaca' 'mulatto')". It provides a 'Shiny' application with
		an exposed API. The application supports five groups of
		functions: (1) Quality control of studbooks contained in text
		files or 'Excel' workbooks and of pedigrees within 'LabKey'
		Electronic Health Records (EHR); (2) Creation of pedigrees from
		a list of animals using the 'LabKey' EHR integration; (3)
		Creation and display of an age by sex pyramid plot of the
		living animals within the designated pedigree; (4) Generation
		of genetic value analysis reports; and (5) Creation of
		potential breeding groups with and without proscribed sex
		ratios and defined maximum kinships.
