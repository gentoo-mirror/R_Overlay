		Develop Actuarial Models // Actuarial reports are prepared for
		the last day of a specific period, such as a month, a quarter
		or a year. Actuarial models assume that certain events happen
		at the beginning or end of periods. The package contains
		functions to easily refer to the first or last (working) day
		within a specific period relative to a base date to facilitate
		actuarial reporting and to compare results.
