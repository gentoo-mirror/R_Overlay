		Multivariate Generalized Kernel Smoothing and Related Statistical
		Methods // Constructs, plots and evaluates probability
		distributions (probability mass/density functions, cumulative
		distribution functions and quantile functions) with continuous
		kernel smoothing, and to a lesser extent, discrete kernel
		smoothing. Supports univariate, multivariate and conditional
		distributions, including multivariate-conditional
		distributions. Also, supports other probability distributions
		(categorical, frequency and empirical-like) and weighted data,
		which is possibly useful mixed with fuzzy clustering.
		Furthermore, there are extensions for computing multivariate
		probabilities and multivariate random numbers, and for
		parameter and mode estimation.
