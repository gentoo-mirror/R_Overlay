		Multivariate Generalized Kernel Smoothing and Related Statistical
		Methods // Probability mass functions (PMFs), probability
		density functions (PDFs), cumulative distribution functions
		(CDFs) and quantile functions, mainly via (optionally
		bounded/truncated) kernel smoothing. In the continuous case,
		there's support for univariate, multivariate and conditional
		distributions, including distributions that are both
		multivariate and conditional. These generalize methods from the
		book "Kernel Smoothing", Wand and Jones (1995). Also, supports
		categorical distributions, mixed conditional distributions
		(with mixed input types) and smooth empirical-like
		distributions, some of which, can be used for statistical
		classification. There are extensions for computing distance
		matrices (between distributions), multivariate probabilities,
		multivariate random numbers, moment-based statistics and mode
		estimates.
