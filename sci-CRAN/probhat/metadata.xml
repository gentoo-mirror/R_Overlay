		Multivariate Generalized Kernel Smoothing and Related Statistical
		Methods // Probability mass functions (PMFs), probability
		density functions (PDFs), cumulative distribution functions
		(CDFs) and quantile functions, mainly via (optionally
		bounded/truncated) kernel smoothing. In the continuous case,
		there's support for univariate, multivariate and conditional
		distributions, including distributions that are both
		multivariate and conditional. Refer to the book "Kernel
		Smoothing" by Wand and Jones (1995), whose methods are
		generalized by the methods here. Also, supports categorical
		distributions, mixed conditional distributions (with mixed
		input types) and smooth empirical-like distributions, some of
		which, can be used for statistical classification. There are
		extensions for computing distance matrices (between
		distributions), multivariate probabilities, multivariate random
		numbers, moment-based statistics and mode estimates.
