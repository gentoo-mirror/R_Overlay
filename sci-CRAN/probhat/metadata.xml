		Multivariate Generalized Kernel Smoothing and Related Statistical
		Methods // Mass functions, density functions, distribution
		functions and quantile functions via continuous kernel
		smoothing, and to a lesser extent, discrete kernel smoothing.
		Also, supports categorical distributions and smooth empirical-
		like distributions. There are univariate, multivariate and
		conditional distributions, including multivariate-conditional
		distributions and conditional distributions with mixed input
		types, along with functions for plotting univariate, bivariate
		and trivariate distributions. Conditional categorical
		distributions with mixed input types can be used for
		statistical classification purposes. And there are extensions
		for computing multivariate probabilities, multivariate random
		numbers, moment-based statistics, robust-based statistics and
		mode estimates.
