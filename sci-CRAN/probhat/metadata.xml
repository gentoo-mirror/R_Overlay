		Generalized Kernel Smoothing // Computes nonparametric
		probability distributions (probability density functions,
		cumulative distribution functions and quantile functions) using
		kernel smoothing. Supports univariate, multivariate and
		conditional distributions, and weighted data (possibly useful
		mixed with fuzzy clustering or frequency data). Also, supports
		empirical continuous cumulative distribution functions and
		their inverses, and random number generation.
