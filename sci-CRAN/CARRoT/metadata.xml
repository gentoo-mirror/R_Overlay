		Predicting Categorical and Continuous Outcomes Using Rule of Ten
		// Predicts categorical or continuous outcomes while
		concentrating on four key points. These are Cross-validation,
		Accuracy, Regression and Rule of Ten (CARRoT). It performs the
		cross-validation specified number of times by partitioning the
		input into training and test set and fitting
		linear/multinomial/binary regression models to the training
		set. All regression models satisfying a rule of ten events per
		variable are fitted and the ones with the best predictive power
		are given as an output. Best predictive power is understood as
		highest accuracy in case of binary/multinomial outcomes,
		smallest absolute and relative errors in case of continuous
		outcomes. For binary case there is also an option of finding a
		regression model which gives the highest AUROC (Area Under
		Recever Operating Curve) value. The option of parallel toolbox
		is also available. Methods are described in Peduzzi et al.
