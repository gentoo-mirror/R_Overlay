		Predicting Categorical and Continuous Outcomes Using One in Ten
		Rule // Predicts categorical or continuous outcomes while
		concentrating on a number of key points. These are Cross-
		validation, Accuracy, Regression and Rule of Ten or "one in ten
		rule" (CARRoT), and, in addition to it R-squared statistics,
		prior knowledge on the dataset etc. It performs the cross-
		validation specified number of times by partitioning the input
		into training and test set and fitting
		linear/multinomial/binary regression models to the training
		set. All regression models satisfying chosen constraints are
		fitted and the ones with the best predictive power are given as
		an output. Best predictive power is understood as highest
		accuracy in case of binary/multinomial outcomes, smallest
		absolute and relative errors in case of continuous outcomes.
		For binary case there is also an option of finding a regression
		model which gives the highest AUROC (Area Under Receiver
		Operating Curve) value. The option of parallel toolbox is also
		available. Methods are described in Peduzzi et al. (1996)
