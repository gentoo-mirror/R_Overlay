		Classifying DNA Sequences to Taxonomic Groupings //
		Classification based analysis of DNA sequences to taxonomic
		groupings. This package primarily implements Naive Bayesian
		Classifier from the Ribosomal Database Project. This approach
		has traditionally been used to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences
		to bacterial taxonomic outlines; however, it can be used for
		any type of gene sequence. The method was originally described
		by Wang, Garrity, Tiedje, and Cole in Applied and Environmental
		Microbiology 73(16):5261-7 doi:10.1128/AEM.00062-07. The
		package also provides functions to read in 'FASTA'-formatted
		sequence data.
