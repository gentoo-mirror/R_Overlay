		Estimate Haplotype Relative Risks in Case-Control Data //
		Haplotype and covariate relative risks in case-control data are
		estimated by weighted logistic regression. Diplotype
		probabilities, which are estimated by EM computation with
		progressive insertion of loci, are utilized as weights. French
