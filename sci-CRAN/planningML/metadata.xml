		A Sample Size Calculator for Machine Learning Applications in
		Healthcare // Advances in automated document classification has
		led to identifying massive numbers of clinical concepts from
		handwritten clinical notes. These high dimensional clinical
		concepts can serve as highly informative predictors in building
		classification algorithms for identifying patients with
		different clinical conditions, commonly referred to as patient
		phenotyping. However, from a planning perspective, it is
		critical to ensure that enough data is available for the
		phenotyping algorithm to obtain a desired classification
		performance. This challenge in sample size planning is further
		exacerbated by the high dimension of the feature space and the
		inherent imbalance of the response class. Currently available
		sample size planning methods can be categorized into: (i)
		model-based approaches that predict the sample size required
		for achieving a desired accuracy using a linear machine
		learning classifier and (ii) learning curve-based approaches
		(Figueroa et al. (2012) doi:10.1186/1472-6947-12-8) that fit an
		inverse power law curve to pilot data to extrapolate
		performance. We develop model-based approaches for imbalanced
		data with correlated features, deriving sample size formulas
		for performance metrics that are sensitive to class imbalance
		such as Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve
		(AUC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). This is done
		using a two-step approach where we first perform feature
		selection using the innovated High Criticism thresholding
		method (Hall and Jin (2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOS764), then
		determine the sample size by optimizing the two performance
		metrics. Further, we develop software in the form of an R
		package named 'planningML' and an 'R' 'Shiny' app to facilitate
		the convenient implementation of the developed model-based
		approaches and learning curve approaches for imbalanced data.
		We apply our methods to the problem of phenotyping rare
		outcomes using the MIMIC-III electronic health record database.
		We show that our developed methods which relate training data
		size and performance on AUC and MCC, can predict the true or
		observed performance from linear ML classifiers such as LASSO
		and SVM at different training data sizes. Therefore, in high-
		dimensional classification analysis with imbalanced data and
		correlated features, our approach can efficiently and
		accurately determine the sample size needed for machine-
		learning based classification.
