		Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer // Provides a model designed to be a
		reliable testbed where various gene drive interventions for
		mosquito-borne diseases control. It is being developed to
		accommodate the use of various mosquito-specific gene drive
		systems within a population dynamics framework that allows
		migration of individuals between patches in landscape. Previous
		work developing the population dynamics can be found in Deredec
		et al. (2001) doi:10.1073/pnas.1110717108 and Hancock  Godfray
		(2007) doi:10.1186/1475-2875-6-98, and extensions to
		accommodate basic CRISPR homing dynamics in Marshall et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1038/s41598-017-02744-7.
