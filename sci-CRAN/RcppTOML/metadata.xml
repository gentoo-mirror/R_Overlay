		'Rcpp' Bindings to Parser for "Tom's Obvious Markup Language" //
		The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
		"Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format
		(described at https://toml.io/en/) suitable for both human
		editing as well as the common uses of a machine-readable
		format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to connect to the 'toml++'
		parser written by Mark Gillard to R.
