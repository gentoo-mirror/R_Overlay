		High Dimensional Stimulation Immune Mapping ('HDStIM') // A
		method for identifying responses to experimental stimulation in
		mass or flow cytometry that uses high dimensional analysis of
		measured parameters and can be performed with an end-to-end
		unsupervised approach. In the context of in vitro stimulation
		assays where high-parameter cytometry was used to monitor
		intracellular response markers, using cell populations
		annotated either through automated clustering or manual gating
		for a combined set of stimulated and unstimulated samples,
		'HDStIM' labels cells as responding or non-responding. The
		package also provides auxiliary functions to rank intracellular
		markers based on their contribution to identifying responses
		and generating diagnostic plots.
