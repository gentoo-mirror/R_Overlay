		Third Order Rotatable Designs (TORDs) // Third order response
		surface designs (M. Hemavathi, Shashi Shekhar, Eldho Varghese,
		Seema Jaggi, Bikas Sinha  Nripes Kumar Mandal (2022)
		DOI:10.1080/03610926.2021.1944213."Theoretical developments in
		response surface designs: an informative review and further
		thoughts") are classified into two types viz., designs which
		are suitable for sequential experimentation and designs for
		non-sequential experimentation (M. Hemavathi, Eldho Varghese,
		Shashi Shekhar  Seema Jaggi
		(2022)DOI:10.1080/02664763.2020.1864817." Sequential asymmetric
		third order rotatable designs (SATORDs)"). The sequential
		experimentation approach involves conducting the trials step by
		step whereas, in the non-sequential experimentation approach,
		the entire runs are executed in one go.This package contains
		functions named STORDs() and NSTORDs() for generating
		sequential/non-sequential TORDs given in Das, M. N., and V. L.
		Narasimham (1962). DOI:10.1214/aoms/1177704374. "Construction
		of rotatable designs through balanced incomplete block designs"
		along with the randomized layout. It also contains another
		function named Pred3.var() for generating the variance of
		predicted response as well as the moment matrix based on a
		third order response surface model.
