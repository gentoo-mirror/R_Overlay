		Conditional Distance Correlation Based Feature Screening and
		Conditional Independence Inference // Conditional distance
		correlation doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.993081 is a novel
		conditional dependence measurement of two multivariate random
		variables given a confounding variable. This package provides
		conditional distance correlation, performs the conditional
		distance correlation sure independence screening procedure for
		ultrahigh dimensional data http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/stati
		stica/J28N1/J28N114/J28N114.html, and conducts conditional
		distance covariance test for conditional independence
		assumption of two multivariate variable.
