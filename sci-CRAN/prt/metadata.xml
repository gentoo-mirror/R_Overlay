		Tabular Data Backed by Partitioned 'fst' Files // Intended for
		larger-than-memory tabular data, 'prt' objects provide an
		interface to read row and/or column subsets into memory as
		data.table objects. Data queries, constructed as 'R'
		expressions, are evaluated using the non-standard evaluation
		framework provided by 'rlang' and file-backing is powered by
		the fast and efficient 'fst' package.
