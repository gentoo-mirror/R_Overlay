		Web-Processing of Large Gridded Datasets // Processes gridded
		datasets found on the U.S. Geological Survey Geo Data Portal
		web application or elsewhere, using a web-enabled workflow that
		eliminates the need to download and store large datasets that
		are reliably hosted on the Internet. The package provides
		access to several data subset and summarization algorithms that
		are available on remote web processing servers (Read et al.
