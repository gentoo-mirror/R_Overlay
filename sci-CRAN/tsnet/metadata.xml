		Fitting, Comparing, and Visualizing Networks Based on Time Series
		Data // Fit, compare, and visualize Bayesian graphical vector
		autoregressive (GVAR) network models using 'Stan'. These models
		are commonly used in psychology to represent temporal and
		contemporaneous relationships between multiple variables in
		intensive longitudinal data. Fitted models can be compared with
		a test based on matrix norm differences of posterior point
		estimates to quantify the differences between two estimated
		networks. See also Siepe, Kloft  Heck (2024)
