		Reinforced Risk Prediction with Budget Constraint // Traditional
		risk prediction only utilizes baseline factors known to be
		associated with the disease. Given that longitudinal
		information are routinely measured and documented for patients,
		it is worthwhile to make full use of these data. The available
		longitudinal biomarker data will likely improve prediction.
		However, repeated biomarker collection could be costly and
		inconvenient, and risk prediction for patients at a later time
		could delay necessary medical decisions. Thus, there is a
		trade-off between high quality prediction and cost. This
		package implements a cost-effective statistical procedure that
		recursively incorporates comprehensive longitudinal information
		into the risk prediction model, taking into account the cost of
		delaying the decision to a follow-up time when more information
		is available. The statistical methods are described in the
		following paper: Pan, Y., Laber, E., Smith, M., Zhao, Y.
		(2018). Reinforced risk prediction with budget constraint:
		application to electronic health records data. Manuscript
		submitted for publication.
