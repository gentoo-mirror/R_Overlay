		Tidy Population Genetics // We provide a tidy grammar of
		population genetics, facilitating the manipulation and analysis
		of data on biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
		'tidypopgen' scales to very large genetic datasets by storing
		genotypes on disk, and performing operations on them in chunks,
		without ever loading all data in memory. The full
		functionalities of the package are described in Carter et al.
