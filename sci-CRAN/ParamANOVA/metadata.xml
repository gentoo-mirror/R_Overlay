		Fully Parameterizable ANOVA Tests // Allows the user to perform
		ANOVA tests (in a strict sense: continuous and normally-
		distributed Y variable and 1 or more factorial/categorical X
		variable(s)), with the possibility to specify the type of sum
		of squares (1, 2 or 3), the types of variables (Fixed or
		Random) and their relationships (crossed or nested) with the
		sole function of the package (FullyParamANOVA()). The resulting
		outputs are the same as in 'SAS' software. A dataset
		(Butterfly) to test the function is also joined.
