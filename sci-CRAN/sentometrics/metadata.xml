		An Integrated Framework for Textual Sentiment Time Series
		Aggregation and Prediction // Time series analysis based on
		textual sentiment, accounting for the intrinsic challenge that
		sentiment can be computed and pooled across texts and time in
		many ways. As described in Ardia et al. (2017)
		https://ssrn.com/abstract=3067734, the package provides a means
		to model the impact of sentiment in texts on a target variable,
		by first computing a wide range of textual sentiment measures
		and then selecting those that are most informative.
