		Factorization of Sparse Counts Matrices Through Poisson
		Likelihood // Creates a low-rank factorization of a sparse
		counts matrix by maximizing Poisson likelihood with l1/l2
		regularization with all non-negative latent factors (e.g. for
		recommender systems or topic modeling) (Cortes, (2018)
		arXiv:1811.01908). Similar to hierarchical Poisson
		factorization, but follows an optimization-based approach with
		regularization instead of a hierarchical structure, and is fit
		through either proximal gradient or conjugate gradient instead
		of variational inference.
