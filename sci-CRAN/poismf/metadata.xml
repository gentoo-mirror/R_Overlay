		Factorization of Sparse Counts Matrices Through Poisson
		Likelihood // Creates a non-negative low-rank approximate
		factorization of a sparse counts matrix by maximizing Poisson
		likelihood with L1/L2 regularization (e.g. for implicit-
		feedback recommender systems or bag-of-words-based topic
		modeling) (Cortes, (2018) arXiv:1811.01908), which usually
		leads to very sparse user and item factors (over 90% zero-
		valued). Similar to hierarchical Poisson factorization (HPF),
		but follows an optimization-based approach with regularization
		instead of a hierarchical prior, and is fit through gradient-
		based methods instead of variational inference.
