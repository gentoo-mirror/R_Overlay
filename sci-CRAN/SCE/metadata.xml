		Stepwise Clustered Ensemble // Implementation of Stepwise
		Clustered Ensemble (SCE) and Stepwise Cluster Analysis (SCA)
		for multivariate data analysis. The package provides
		comprehensive tools for feature selection, model training,
		prediction, and evaluation in hydrological and environmental
		modeling applications. Key functionalities include recursive
		feature elimination (RFE), Wilks feature importance analysis,
		model validation through out-of-bag (OOB) validation, and
		ensemble prediction capabilities. The package supports both
		single and multivariate response variables, making it suitable
		for complex environmental modeling scenarios. For more details
		see Li et al. (2021) doi:10.5194/hess-25-4947-2021.
