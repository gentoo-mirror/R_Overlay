		Dose Response Data Analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic (4pl)
		Model // Models the relationship between dose levels and
		responses in a pharmacological experiment using the 4 Parameter
		Logistic model. Traditional packages on dose-response modelling
		such as 'drc' and 'nplr' often draw errors due to convergence
		failure especially when data have outliers or non-logistic
		shapes. This package provides robust estimation methods that
		are less affected by outliers and other initialization methods
		that work well for data lacking logistic shapes. We provide the
		bounds on the parameters of the 4PL model that prevent
		parameter estimates from diverging or converging to zero and
		base their justification in a statistical principle. These
		methods are used as remedies to convergence failure problems.
