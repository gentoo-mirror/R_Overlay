		Automated Vector Autoregression Models and Networks //
		Automatically find the best vector autoregression models and
		networks for a given time series data set. 'AutovarCore'
		evaluates eight kinds of models: models with and without log
		transforming the data, lag 1 and lag 2 models, and models with
		and without weekday dummy variables. For each of these 8 model
		configurations, 'AutovarCore' evaluates all possible
		combinations for including outlier dummies (at 2.5x the
		standard deviation of the residuals) and retains the best
		model. Model evaluation includes the Eigenvalue stability test
		and a configurable set of residual tests. These eight models
		are further reduced to four models because 'AutovarCore'
		determines whether adding weekday dummies improves the model
		fit.
