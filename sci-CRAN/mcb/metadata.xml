		Model Confidence Bounds // When choosing proper variable
		selection methods, it is important to consider the uncertainty
		of a certain method. The Model Confidence Bound for variable
		selection identifies two nested models (upper and lower
		confidence bound models) containing the true model at a given
		confidence level. A good variable selection method is the one
		of which the Model Confidence Bound under a certain confidence
		level has the shortest width. When visualizing the variability
		of model selection and comparing different model selection
		procedures, Model Uncertainty Curve is a good graphical tool. A
		good variable selection method is the one of whose Model
		Uncertainty Curve will tend to arch towards the upper left
		corner. This function aims to obtain the Model Confidence Bound
		and draw the Model Uncertainty Curve of certain single model
		selection method under a coverage rate equal or little higher
		than user-given confidential level. About what Model Confidence
		Bound is and how it work please see Li,Y., Luo,Y., Ferrari,D.,
		Hu,X. and Qin,Y. (2019) Model Confidence Bounds for Variable
		Selection. Biometrics, 75:392-403. DOI:10.1111/biom.13024.
