		Iterative Pruning to Capture Population Structure // An
		unsupervised clustering algorithm based on iterative pruning is
		for capturing population structure. This version supports
		ordinal data which can be applied directly to SNP data to
		identify fine-level population structure and it is built on the
		iterative pruning Principal Component Analysis ('ipPCA')
		algorithm as explained in Intarapanich et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1186/1471-2105-10-382. The 'IPCAPS' involves an
		iterative process using multiple splits based on multivariate
		Gaussian mixture modeling of principal components and
		'Expectation-Maximization' clustering as explained in Lebret et
		al. (2015) doi:10.18637/jss.v067.i06. In each iteration, rough
		clusters and outliers are also identified using the function
		rubikclust() from the R package 'KRIS'.
