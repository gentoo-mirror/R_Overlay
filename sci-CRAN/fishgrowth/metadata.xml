		Fit Growth Curves to Fish Data // Fit growth models to otoliths
		and/or tagging data, using the 'RTMB' package and maximum
		likelihood. The otoliths (or similar measurements of age)
		provide direct observed coordinates of age and length. The
		tagging data provide information about the observed length at
		release and length at recapture at a later time, where the age
		at release is unknown and estimated as a vector of parameters.
		The growth models provided by this package can be fitted to
		otoliths only, tagging data only, or a combination of the two.
		Growth variability can be modelled as constant or increasing
		with length.
