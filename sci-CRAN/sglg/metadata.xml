		Fitting Semi-Parametric Generalized log-Gamma Regression Models
		// Set of tools to fit a linear multiple or semi-parametric
		regression models. Under this setup, the localization parameter
		of the response variable distribution is modeled by using
		linear multiple regression or semi-parametric functions, whose
		non-parametric components may be approximated by natural cubic
		spline or P-splines. The supported distribution for the model
		error is a generalized log-gamma distribution which includes
		the generalized extreme value distribution as an important
		special case.
