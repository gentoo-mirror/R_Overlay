		Fitting Semi-Parametric Generalized log-Gamma Regression Models
		// Set of tools to fit a linear multiple or semi-parametric
		regression models with the possibility of non-informative
		random right-censoring. Under this setup, the localization
		parameter of the response variable distribution is modeled by
		using linear multiple regression or semi-parametric functions,
		whose non-parametric components may be approximated by natural
		cubic spline or P-splines. The supported distribution for the
		model error is a generalized log-gamma distribution which
		includes the generalized extreme value and standard normal
		distributions as important special cases. Inference is based on
		penalized likelihood and bootstrap methods. Also, some
		numerical and graphical devices for diagnostic of the fitted
		models are offered.
