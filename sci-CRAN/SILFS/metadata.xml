		Subgroup Identification with Latent Factor Structure // In
		various domains, many datasets exhibit both high variable
		dependency and group structures, which necessitates their
		simultaneous estimation. This package provides functions for
		two subgroup identification methods based on penalized
		functions, both of which utilize factor model structures to
		adapt to data with cross-sectional dependency. The first method
		is the Subgroup Identification with Latent Factor Structure
		Method (SILFSM) we proposed. By employing Center-Augmented
		Regularization and factor structures, the SILFSM effectively
		eliminates data dependencies while identifying subgroups within
		datasets. For this model, we offer optimization functions based
		on two different methods: Coordinate Descent and our newly
		developed Difference of Convex-Alternating Direction Method of
		Multipliers (DC-ADMM) algorithms; the latter can be applied to
		cases where the distance function in Center-Augmented
		Regularization takes L1 and L2 forms. The other method is the
		Factor-Adjusted Pairwise Fusion Penalty (FA-PFP) model, which
		incorporates factor augmentation into the Pairwise Fusion
		Penalty (PFP) developed by Ma, S. and Huang, J. (2017)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1148039. Additionally, we provide a
		function for the Standard CAR (S-CAR) method, which does not
		consider the dependency and is for comparative analysis with
		other approaches. Furthermore, functions based on the Bayesian
		Information Criterion (BIC) of the SILFSM and the FA-PFP method
		are also included in 'SILFS' for selecting tuning parameters.
		For more details of Subgroup Identification with Latent Factor
		Structure Method, please refer to He et al. (2024)
