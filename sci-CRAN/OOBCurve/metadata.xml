		Out of Bag Learning Curve // Provides functions to calculate the
		out-of-bag learning curve for random forests for any measure
		that is available in the 'mlr' package. Supported random forest
		packages are 'randomForest' and 'ranger' and trained models of
		these packages with the train function of 'mlr'. The main
		function is OOBCurve() that calculates the out-of-bag curve
		depending on the number of trees. With the OOBCurvePars()
		function out-of-bag curves can also be calculated for 'mtry',
		'sample.fraction' and 'min.node.size' for the 'ranger' package.
