		IPP Toolbox // Uncertainty quantification and propagation in the
		framework of Dempster-Shafer Theory and imprecise
		probabilities. This toolbox offers easy-to-use methods for
		using imprecise probabities for applied uncertainty modelling
		and simulation. The package comprises the basic functionality
		needed, with usability similar to standard probabilistic
		analysis: - Fit imprecise probability distributions from data,
		- Define imprecise probabilities based on distribution
		functions, - Combine with various aggregation rules (e. g.
		Dempster's rule), - Plotting tools, - Propagate through
		arbitrary functions / simulations via Monte Carlo, - Perform
		sensitivity analyses with imprecise distributions, - Example
		models for a quick start.
