		Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity
		Designs // Understanding heterogeneous causal effects based on
		pretreatment covariates is a crucial step in modern empirical
		work in data science. Building on the recent developments in
		Calonico et al (2025)
		https://rdpackages.github.io/references/Calonico-Cattaneo-
		Farrell-Palomba-Titiunik_2025_HTERD.pdf, this package provides
		tools for estimation and inference of heterogeneous treatment
		effects in Regression Discontinuity (RD) Designs. The package
		includes two main commands: 'rdhte' to conduct estimation and
		robust bias-corrected inference for conditional RD treatment
		effects (given choice of bandwidth parameter); and 'rdbwhte',
		which implements automatic bandwidth selection methods.
