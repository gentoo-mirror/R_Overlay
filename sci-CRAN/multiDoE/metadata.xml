		Multi-Criteria Design of Experiments for Optimal Design // Multi-
		criteria design of experiments algorithm that simultaneously
		optimizes up to six different criteria ('I', 'Id', 'D', 'Ds',
		'A' and 'As'). The algorithm finds the optimal Pareto front
		and, if requested, selects a possible symmetrical design on it.
		The symmetrical design is selected based on two techniques:
		minimum distance with the Utopia point or the 'TOPSIS'
		approach.
