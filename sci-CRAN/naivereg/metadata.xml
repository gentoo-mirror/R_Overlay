		Nonparametric Additive Instrumental Variable Estimator: A Group
		Shrinkage Estimation Perspective // In empirical studies,
		instrumental variable (IV) regression is the signature method
		to solve the endogeneity problem. If we enforce the exogeneity
		condition of the IV, it is likely that we end up with a large
		set of IVs without knowing which ones are good. This package
		uses adaptive group lasso and B-spline methods to select the
		nonparametric components of the IV function, with the linear
		function being a special case. The package incorporates two
		stage least squares estimator (2SLS), generalized method of
		moment (GMM), generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) methods
		post instrument selection. It is nonparametric version of
		'ivregress' in 'Stata' with IV selection and high dimensional
		features. The package is based on the paper "Nonparametric
		Additive Instrumental Variable Estimator: A Group Shrinkage
		Estimation Perspective" (2017) published online in Journal of
		Business  Economic Statistics
