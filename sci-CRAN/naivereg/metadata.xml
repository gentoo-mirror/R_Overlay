		Nonparametric Additive Instrumental Variable Estimator and
		Related IV Methods // In empirical studies, instrumental
		variable (IV) regression is the signature method to solve the
		endogeneity problem. If we enforce the exogeneity condition of
		the IV, it is likely that we end up with a large set of IVs
		without knowing which ones are good. Also, one could face the
		model uncertainty for structural equation, as large micro
		dataset is commonly available nowadays. This package uses
		adaptive group lasso and B-spline methods to select the
		nonparametric components of the IV function, with the linear
		function being a special case (naivereg). The package also
		incorporates two stage least squares estimator (2SLS),
		generalized method of moment (GMM), generalized empirical
		likelihood (GEL) methods post instrument selection, logistic-
		regression instrumental variables estimator (LIVE, for dummy
		endogenous variable problem), double-selection plus
		instrumental variable estimator (DS-IV) and double selection
		plus logistic regression instrumental variable estimator (DS-
		LIVE), where the double selection methods are useful for high-
		dimensional structural equation models. The naivereg is
		nonparametric version of 'ivregress' in 'Stata' with IV
		selection and high dimensional features. The package is based
		on the paper by Q. Fan and W. Zhong, "Nonparametric Additive
		Instrumental Variable Estimator: A Group Shrinkage Estimation
		Perspective" (2018), Journal of Business  Economic Statistics
		doi:10.1080/07350015.2016.1180991 as well as a series of
		working papers led by the same authors.
