		Cross-Entropy Optimisation of Noisy Functions // Cross-Entropy
		optimisation of unconstrained deterministic and noisy functions
		illustrated in Rubinstein and Kroese (2004, ISBN:
		978-1-4419-1940-3) through a highly flexible and customisable
		function which allows user to define custom variable domains,
		sampling distributions, updating and smoothing rules, and
		stopping criteria. Several built-in methods and settings make
		the package very easy-to-use under standard optimisation
		problems.
