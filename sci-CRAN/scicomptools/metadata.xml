		Tools Developed by the NCEAS Scientific Computing Support Team //
		Set of tools to import, summarize, wrangle, and visualize data.
		These functions were originally written based on the needs of
		the various synthesis working groups that were supported by the
		National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS).
		These tools are meant to be useful inside and outside of the
		context for which they were designed.
