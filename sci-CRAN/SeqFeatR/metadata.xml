		A Tool to Associate FASTA Sequences and Features // Provides user
		friendly methods for the identification of sequence patterns
		that are statistically significantly associated with a property
		of the sequence. For instance, SeqFeatR allows to identify
		viral immune escape mutations for hosts of given HLA types. The
		underlying statistical method is Fisher's exact test, with
		appropriate corrections for multiple testing, or Bayes.
		Patterns may be point mutations or n-tuple of mutations.
		SeqFeatR offers several ways to visualize the results of the
		statistical analyses, see Budeus (2016)
