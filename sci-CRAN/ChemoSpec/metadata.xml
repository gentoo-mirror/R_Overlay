		Exploratory Chemometrics for Spectroscopy // A collection of
		functions for top-down exploratory data analysis of spectral
		data including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR),
		Raman, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and other similar types of
		spectroscopy. Includes functions for plotting and inspecting
		spectra, peak alignment, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA),
		principal components analysis (PCA) and model-based clustering.
		Robust methods appropriate for this type of high-dimensional
		data are available. ChemoSpec is designed for structured
		experiments, such as metabolomics investigations, where the
		samples fall into treatment and control groups. Graphical
		output is formatted consistently for publication quality plots.
		ChemoSpec is intended to be very user friendly and to help you
		get usable results quickly. A vignette covering typical
		operations is available.
