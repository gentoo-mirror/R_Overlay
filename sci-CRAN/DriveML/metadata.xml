		Self-Drive Machine Learning Projects // Implementing some of the
		pillars of an automated machine learning pipeline such as (i)
		Automated data preparation, (ii) Feature engineering, (iii)
		Model building in classification context that includes
		techniques such as (a) Regularised regression [1], (b) Logistic
		regression [2], (c) Random Forest [3], (d) Decision tree [4]
		and (e) Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost) [5], and finally,
		(iv) Model explanation (using lift chart and partial dependency
		plots). Accomplishes the above tasks  by running the function
		instead of writing lengthy R codes. Also provides some
		additional features such as generating missing at random (MAR)
		variables and automated exploratory data analysis. Moreover,
		function exports the model results with the required plots in
		an HTML vignette report format that follows the best practices
		of the industry and the academia. [1] Gonzales G B and De
