		Simulate Dynamic Networks from Relational Event Models // Model
		based simulation of dynamic networks under tie-oriented (Butts,
		C., 2008, doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x) and actor-
		oriented (Stadtfeld, C.,  Block, P., 2017, doi:10.15195/v4.a14)
		relational event models. Supports simulation from a variety of
		relational event model extensions, including temporal
		variability in effects, heterogeneity through dyadic latent
		class relational event models (DLC-REM), random effects,
		blockmodels, and memory decay in relational event models
		(Lakdawala, R., 2024 doi:10.48550/arXiv.2403.19329). The
		development of this package was supported by a Vidi Grant
		(452-17-006) awarded by the Netherlands Organization for
		Scientific Research (NWO) Grant and an ERC Starting Grant
		(758791).
