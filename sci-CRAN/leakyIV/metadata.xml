		Leaky Instrumental Variables // Instrumental variables (IVs) are
		a popular and powerful tool for estimating causal effects in
		the presence of unobserved confounding. However, classical
		methods rely on strong assumptions such as the exclusion
		criterion, which states that instrumental effects must be
		entirely mediated by treatments. In the so-called "leaky" IV
		setting, candidate instruments are allowed to have some direct
		influence on outcomes, rendering the average treatment effect
		(ATE) unidentifiable. But with limits on the amount of
		information leakage, we may still recover sharp bounds on the
		ATE, providing partial identification. This package implements
		methods for ATE bounding in the leaky IV setting with linear
		structural equations. For details, see Watson et al. (2024)
