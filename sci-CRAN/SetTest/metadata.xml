		Group Testing Procedures for Signal Detection and Goodness-of-Fit
		// It provides cumulative distribution function (CDF),
		quantile, p-value, statistical power calculator and random
		number generator for a collection of group-testing procedures,
		including the Higher Criticism tests, the one-sided Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov tests, the one-sided Berk-Jones tests, the one-sided
		phi-divergence tests, etc. The input are a group of p-values.
		The null hypothesis is that they are i.i.d. Uniform(0,1). In
		the context of signal detection, the null hypothesis means no
		signals. In the context of the goodness-of-fit testing, which
		contrasts a group of i.i.d. random variables to a given
		continuous distribution, the input p-values can be obtained by
		the CDF transformation. The null hypothesis means that these
		random variables follow the given distribution. For reference,
		see Hong Zhang, Jiashun Jin and Zheyang Wu. "Distributions and
		Statistical Power of Optimal Signal-Detection Methods In Finite
		Cases", submitted.
