		Fresh Weight Determination from Visual Image of the Plant //
		Fresh biomass determination is the key to evaluating crop
		genotypes' response to diverse input and stress conditions and
		forms the basis for calculating net primary production.
		However, as conventional phenotyping approaches for measuring
		fresh biomass is time-consuming, laborious and destructive,
		image-based phenotyping methods are being widely used now. In
		the image-based approach, the fresh weight of the above-ground
		part of the plant depends on the projected area. For
		determining the projected area, the visual image of the plant
		is converted into the grayscale image by simply averaging the
		Red(R), Green (G) and Blue (B) pixel values. Grayscale image is
		then converted into a binary image using Otsus thresholding
		method Otsu, N. (1979) doi:10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076 to
		separate plant area from the background (image segmentation).
		The segmentation process was accomplished by selecting the
		pixels with values over the threshold value belonging to the
		plant region and other pixels to the background region. The
		resulting binary image consists of white and black pixels
		representing the plant and background regions. Finally, the
		number of pixels inside the plant region was counted and
		converted to square centimetres (cm2) using the reference
		object (any object whose actual area is known previously) to
		get the projected area. After that, the projected area is used
		as input to the machine learning model (Linear Model,
		Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Regression) to
		determine the plant's fresh weight.
