		Prediction of Antimicrobial Peptides // Predicts antimicrobial
		peptides using random forests trained on the n-gram encoded
		peptides. The implemented algorithm can be accessed from both
		the command line and shiny-based GUI. The AmpGram model is too
		large for CRAN and it has to be downloaded separately from the
		repository: https://github.com/michbur/AmpGramModel.
