		Models for Correlation Matrices Based on Graphs // Implement some
		models for correlation/covariance matrices including two
		approaches to model correlation matrices from a graphical
		structure. One use latent parent variables as proposed in
		Sterrantino et. al. (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.06289. The
		other uses a graph to specify conditional relations between the
		variables. The graphical structure makes correlation matrices
		interpretable and avoids the quadratic increase of parameters
		as a function of the dimension. In the first approach a natural
		sequence of simpler models along with a complexity penalization
		is used. The second penalizes deviations from a base model.
		These can be used as prior for model parameters, considering C
		code through the 'cgeneric' interface for the 'INLA' package
		(https://www.r-inla.org). This allows one to use these models
		as building blocks combined and to other latent Gaussian models
		in order to build complex data models.
