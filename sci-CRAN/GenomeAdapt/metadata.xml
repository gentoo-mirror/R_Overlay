		Detecting Signatures of Local Adaptation Based on Ancestry
		Trajectories // Portable, scalable and highly computationally
		efficient tool for detecting signatures of local adaptation
		based on multidimensional ancestry map ( _n_ X _n_ ancestry
		genetic trajectories, _n_ is the number of individuals). If n
		samples are included in the analysis, there will be n
		dimensional spaces that represent the common ancestry maps
		based on the identity-by-descent (IBD). The package calculates
		the correlations of loci with the common ancestry genetic maps
		adopting the Genomic Data Structure (GDS, Zheng et al., 2012)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts606 and suitable for millions of
		SNP data. Loci sharing a greater level of most recent common
		ancestor (MRCA) (large Z-scores) indicates a large number of
		individuals descend from recent common ancestors, which signals
		the rapid increase in frequency of a beneficial allele due to
		recent positive selection. The rationale underlying this
		package is somewhat analogous to KLFDAPT (Qin, 2021)
		doi:10.1101/2021.05.15.444294 (https://xinghuq.github.io/KLFDAP
		C/articles/Genome_scan_KLFDAPC.html). It combines the concept
		of IBD-based genome scan (Albrechtsen et al., 2010)
		doi:10.1534/genetics.110.113977, iHS (Voight, 2006)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072, and eigenanalysis of SNP data
		with an identity by descent interpretation (Zheng  Weir, 2016)
		doi: 10.1016/j.tpb.2015.09.004. It can also be interpreted as
		spatial varying selection as ancestry genetic maps reflect
		geographic origins. Besides the detection of local adaptation,
		this package also estimates the population admixtures and plots
		its geographic genetic structure.
