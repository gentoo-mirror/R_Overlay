		A Collection of R Functions by the Petersen Lab // A collection
		of R functions that are widely used by the Petersen Lab.
		Included are functions for various purposes, including
		evaluating the accuracy of judgments and predictions,
		performing scoring of assessments, generating correlation
		matrices, conversion of data between various types, data
		management, psychometric evaluation, extensions related to
		latent variable modeling, various plotting capabilities, and
		other miscellaneous useful functions. By making the package
		available, we hope to make our methods reproducible and
		replicable by others and to help others perform their data
		processing and analysis methods more easily and efficiently.
		The codebase is in doi:10.5281/zenodo.7602890. The package is
		described in Petersen (2024) doi:10.1201/9781003357421,
		doi:10.5281/zenodo.6466590.
