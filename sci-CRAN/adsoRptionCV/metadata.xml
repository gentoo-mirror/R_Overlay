		Cross-Validation Methods for Adsorption Isotherm Models //
		Provides cross-validation tools for adsorption isotherm models,
		supporting both linear and non-linear forms. Current methods
		cover commonly used isotherms including the Freundlich,
		Langmuir, and Temkin models. This package implements K-fold and
		leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) with optional
		clustering-based fold assignment to preserve underlying data
		structures during validation. Model predictive performance is
		assessed using mean squared error (MSE), with optional
		graphical visualization of fold-wise MSEs to support intuitive
		evaluation of model accuracy. This package is intended to
		facilitate rigorous model validation in adsorption studies and
		aid researchers in selecting robust isotherm models. For more
		details, see Montgomery et al. (2012) isbn: 978-0-470-54281-1,
		Lumumba et al. (2024) doi:10.11648/j.ajtas.20241305.13, and
		Yates et al. (2022) doi:10.1002/ecm.1557.
