		Marginal Mediation // Provides the ability to perform "Marginal
		Mediation"--mediation wherein the indirect and direct effects
		are in terms of the average marginal effects (Bartus, 2005, htt
		ps://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:tsj:stataj:v:5:y:2005:i:3:p:309
		-329). The style of the average marginal effects stems from
		Thomas Leeper's work on the "margins" package. This framework
		allows the use of categorical mediators and outcomes with
		little change in interpretation from the continuous
		mediators/outcomes. See doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.18465.92001 for
		more details on the method (peer reviewed articles
		forthcoming).
