		An Interactive HTML Image Editing Tool // An interactive image
		editing tool that can be added as part of the HTML in Shiny, R
		markdown or any type of HTML document. Often times, plots,
		photos are embedded in the web application/file. 'drawer' can
		take screenshots of these image-like elements, or any part of
		the HTML document and send to an image editing space called
		'canvas' to allow users immediately edit the screenshot(s)
		within the same document. Users can quickly combine, compare
		different screenshots, upload their own images and maybe make a
		scientific figure.
