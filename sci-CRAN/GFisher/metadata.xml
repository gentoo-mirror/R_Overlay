		Generalized Fisher's Combination Tests Under Dependence //
		Accurate and computationally efficient p-value calculation
		methods for a general family of Fisher type statistics
		(GFisher). The GFisher covers Fisher's combination, Good's
		statistic, Lancaster's statistic, weighted Z-score combination,
		etc. It allows a flexible weighting scheme, as well as an
		omnibus procedure that automatically adapts proper weights and
		degrees of freedom to a given data. The new p-value calculation
		methods are based on novel ideas of moment-ratio matching and
		joint-distribution approximation. The technical details can be
		found in Hong Zhang and Zheyang Wu (2020) arXiv:2003.01286.
