		Variable Selection for Multiply Imputed Data // Penalized
		regression methods, such as lasso and elastic net, are used in
		many biomedical applications when simultaneous regression
		coefficient estimation and variable selection is desired.
		However, missing data complicates the implementation of these
		methods, particularly when missingness is handled using
		multiple imputation. Applying a variable selection algorithm on
		each imputed dataset will likely lead to different sets of
		selected predictors, making it difficult to ascertain a final
		active set without resorting to ad hoc combination rules.
		'miselect' presents Stacked Adaptive Elastic Net (saenet) and
		Grouped Adaptive LASSO (galasso) for continuous and binary
		outcomes, developed by Du et al (2020), currently under review.
		They, by construction, force selection of the same variables
		across multiply imputed data. 'miselect' also provides cross
		validated variants of these methods.
