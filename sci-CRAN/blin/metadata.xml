		Bipartite Longitudinal Influence Network (BLIN) Estimation //
		Estimate influence networks from longitudinal bipartite
		relational data, where the longitudinal relations are
		continuous. The outputs are estimates of weighted influence
		networks among each actor type in the data set. The generative
		model is the Bipartite Longitudinal Influence Network (BLIN)
		model, a linear autoregressive model for these type of data.
		The supporting paper is ``Inferring Influence Networks from
		Longitudinal Bipartite Relational Data'', which is in
		preparation by the same authors. The model may be estimated
		using maximum likelihood methods and Bayesian methods. For more
		detail on methods, see Marrs et. al. arXiv:1809.03439.
