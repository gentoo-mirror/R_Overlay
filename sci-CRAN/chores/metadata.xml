		A Collection of Large Language Model Assistants // Provides a
		collection of ergonomic large language model assistants
		designed to help you complete repetitive, hard-to-automate
		tasks quickly. After selecting some code, press the keyboard
		shortcut you've chosen to trigger the package app, select an
		assistant, and watch your chore be carried out. While the
		package ships with a number of chore helpers for R package
		development, users can create custom helpers just by writing
		some instructions in a markdown file.
