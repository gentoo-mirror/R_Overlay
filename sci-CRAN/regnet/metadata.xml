		Network-Based Regularization for Generalized Linear Models //
		Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable
		selection for high-dimensional biological data due to its
		ability to incorporate correlations among genomic features.
		This package provides procedures of network-based variable
		selection for generalized linear models (Ren et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1186/s12863-017-0495-5 and Ren et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1002/gepi.22194). Two recent additions are the robust
		network regularization for the survival response and the
		network regularization for continuous response. Functions for
		other regularization methods will be included in the
		forthcoming upgraded versions.
