		Network-Based Regularization for Generalized Linear Models //
		Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable
		selection for high-dimensional biological data due to its
		ability to incorporate correlations among genomic features.
		This package provides procedures of network-based variable
		selection for generalized linear models (Ren et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1186/s12863-017-0495-5 and Ren et al.(2019)
		doi:10.1002/gepi.22194). Continuous, binary, and survival
		response are supported. Robust network-based methods are
		available for continuous and survival responses.
