		Network-Based Regularization for Generalized Linear Models //
		Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable
		selection for high-dimensional biological data due to its
		ability to incorporate correlations among genomic features.
		This package provides procedures of network-based variable
		selection for generalized linear models. Two recent additions
		are the robust network regularization for the survival response
		and the network regularization for continuous response.
		Functions for other regularization methods will be included in
		the forthcoming upgraded versions.
