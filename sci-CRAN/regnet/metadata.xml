		Network-Based Regularization for Generalized Linear Models //
		Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable
		selections for high-dimensional biological data, due to its
		ability to incorporate the correlations among genomic
		features.This package provides procedures for fitting network-
		based regularization, minimax concave penalty (MCP) and lasso
		penalty for generalized linear models. This first version,
		regent0.1.0, focuses on binary outcomes. Functions for
		continuous, survival outcomes and other regularization methods
		will be included in the forthcoming upgraded version.
