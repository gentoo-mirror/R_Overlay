		Network-Based Regularization for Generalized Linear Models //
		Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable
		selection for high-dimensional biological data due to its
		ability to incorporate correlations between genomic features.
		This package provides procedures for fitting network-based
		regularization, minimax concave penalty (MCP) and lasso penalty
		for generalized linear models. This current version,
		regnet0.2.0, focuses on binary outcomes. Functions for
		continuous, survival outcomes and other regularization methods
		will be included in the forthcoming upgraded versions.
