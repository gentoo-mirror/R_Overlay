		Convert Files to and from Binary Objects (BLOBs) // Converts
		files to and from flobs. A flob is a file that was read into
		binary in integer-mode as little endian, saved as the single
		element of a named list (where the name is the name of the
		original file) and then serialized before being coerced into a
		blob. Flobs are useful for writing and reading files to and
		from databases.
