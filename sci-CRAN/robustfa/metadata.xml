		Object Oriented Solution for Robust Factor Analysis // Outliers
		virtually exist in any datasets of any application field. To
		avoid the impact of outliers, we need to use robust estimators.
		Classical estimators of multivariate mean and covariance matrix
		are the sample mean and the sample covariance matrix. Outliers
		will affect the sample mean and the sample covariance matrix,
		and thus they will affect the classical factor analysis which
		depends on the classical estimators (Pison, G., Rousseeuw,
		P.J., Filzmoser, P. and Croux, C. (2003)
		doi:10.1016/S0047-259X(02)00007-6). So it is necessary to use
		the robust estimators of the sample mean and the sample
		covariance matrix. There are several robust estimators in the
		literature: Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator,
		Orthogonalized Gnanadesikan-Kettenring, Minimum Volume
		Ellipsoid, M, S, and Stahel-Donoho. The most direct way to make
		multivariate analysis more robust is to replace the sample mean
		and the sample covariance matrix of the classical estimators to
		robust estimators (Maronna, R.A., Martin, D. and Yohai, V.
		(2006) doi:10.1002/0470010940) (Todorov, V. and Filzmoser, P.
		(2009) doi:10.18637/jss.v032.i03), which is our choice of
		robust factor analysis. We created an object oriented solution
		for robust factor analysis based on new S4 classes.
