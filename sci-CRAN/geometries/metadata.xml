		Convert Between R Objects and Geometric Structures // Geometry
		shapes in 'R' are typically represented by matrices (points,
		lines), with more complex shapes being lists of matrices
		(polygons). 'Geometries' will convert various 'R' objects into
		these shapes. Conversion functions are available at both the
		'R' level, and through 'Rcpp'.
