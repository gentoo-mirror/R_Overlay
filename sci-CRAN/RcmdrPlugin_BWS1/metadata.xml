		R Commander Plug-in for Case 1 Best-Worst Scaling // Adds menu
		items to the R Commander for implementing case 1 (object case)
		best-worst scaling (BWS1) from designing choice sets to
		measuring preferences for items. BWS1 is a question-based
		survey method that constructs various combinations of items
		(choice sets) using the experimental designs, asks respondents
		to select the best and worst items in each choice set, and then
		measures preferences for the items by analyzing the responses.
		For details, refer to Aizaki and Fogarty (2023)
