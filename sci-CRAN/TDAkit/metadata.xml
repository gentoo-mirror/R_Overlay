		Toolkit for Topological Data Analysis // Topological data
		analysis studies structure and shape of the data using
		topological features. We provide a variety of algorithms to
		learn with persistent homology of the data based on functional
		summaries for clustering, hypothesis testing, visualization,
		and others. We refer to Wasserman (2018) doi:10.1146/annurev-
		statistics-031017-100045 for a statistical perspective on the
		topic.
