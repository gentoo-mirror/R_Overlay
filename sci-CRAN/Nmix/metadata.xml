		Bayesian Inference on Univariate Normal Mixtures // A program for
		Bayesian analysis of univariate normal mixtures with an unknown
		number of components, following the approach of Richardson and
		Green (1997) doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00095. This makes use of
		reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that are
		capable of jumping between the parameter sub-spaces
		corresponding to different numbers of components in the
		mixture. A sample from the full joint distribution of all
		unknown variables is thereby generated, and this can be used as
		a basis for a thorough presentation of many aspects of the
		posterior distribution.
