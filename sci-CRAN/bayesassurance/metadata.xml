		Bayesian Assurance Computation // Computes Bayesian assurance
		under various settings characterized by different assumptions
		and objectives, including precision-based conditions, credible
		intervals, and goal functions. All simulation-based functions
		included in this package rely on a two-stage Bayesian method
		that assigns two distinct priors to evaluate the probability of
		observing a positive outcome, which addresses subtle
		limitations that take place when using the standard single-
		prior approach. For more information, please refer to Pan and
		Banerjee (2021) arXiv:2112.03509.
