		Presentation-Ready Data Summary and Analytic Result Tables //
		Creates presentation-ready tables summarizing data sets,
		regression models, and more. The code to create the tables is
		concise and highly customizable. Data frames can be summarized
		with any function, e.g. mean(), median(), even user-written
		functions. Regression models are summarized and include the
		reference rows for categorical variables. Common regression
		models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional
		hazards regression, are automatically identified and the tables
		are pre-filled with appropriate column headers. The package is
		enhanced when the 'gt' package is installed. Use this code to
		install: 'remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")'.
