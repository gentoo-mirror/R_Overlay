		Deriving Expressions of Joint Interventional Distributions and
		Transport Formulas in Causal Models // Functions for
		identification and transportation of causal effects. Provides a
		conditional causal effect identification algorithm (IDC) by
		Shpitser, I. and Pearl, J. (2006)
		http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r329-uai.pdf, an algorithm
		for transportability from multiple domains with limited
		experiments by Bareinboim, E. and Pearl, J. (2014)
		http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r443.pdf and a selection
		bias recovery algorithm by Bareinboim, E. and Tian, J. (2015)
		http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r445.pdf. All of the
		previously mentioned algorithms are based on a causal effect
		identification algorithm by Tian , J. (2002)
		http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r309.pdf.
