		Diagnostic Tools for Hierarchical (Multilevel) Linear Models // A
		suite of diagnostic tools for hierarchical (multilevel) linear
		models. The tools include not only leverage and traditional
		deletion diagnostics (Cook's distance, covratio, covtrace, and
		MDFFITS) but also convenience functions and graphics for
		residual analysis. Models can be fit using either lmer in the
		'lme4' package or lme in the 'nlme' package.
