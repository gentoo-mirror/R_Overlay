		Accelerated Sparse Discriminant Analysis // Implementation of
		sparse linear discriminant analysis, which is a supervised
		classification method for multiple classes. Various novel
		optimization approaches to this problem are implemented
		including alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
		proximal gradient (PG) and accelerated proximal gradient (APG)
		(See Atkins et al. arXiv:1705.07194). Functions for performing
		cross validation are also supplied along with basic prediction
		and plotting functions. Sparse zero variance discriminant
		analysis (SZVD) is also included in the package (See Ames and
		Hong, arXiv:1401.5492). See the github wiki for a more extended
		description.
