		Intrinsic Dimension for Data Mining // Contains techniques for
		mining large and high-dimensional data sets by using the
		concept of Intrinsic Dimension (ID). Here the ID is not
		necessarily an integer. It is extended to fractal dimensions.
		And the Morisita estimator is used for the ID estimation, but
		other tools are included as well.
