		Prediction-Based Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis // A tool
		for inferring kinase activity changes from phosphoproteomics
		data. 'pKSEA' uses kinase-substrate prediction scores to weight
		observed changes in phosphopeptide abundance to calculate a
		phosphopeptide-level contribution score, then sums up these
		contribution scores by kinase to obtain a phosphoproteome-level
		kinase activity change score (KAC score). 'pKSEA' then assesses
		the significance of changes in predicted substrate abundances
		for each kinase using permutation testing. This results in a
		permutation score (pKSEA significance score) reflecting the
		likelihood of a similarly high or low KAC from random chance,
		which can then be interpreted in an analogous manner to an
		empirically calculated p-value. 'pKSEA' contains default
		databases of kinase-substrate predictions from 'NetworKIN'
		(NetworKINPred_db) http://networkin.info Horn, et. al (2014)
		doi:10.1038/nmeth.2968 and of known kinase-substrate links from
		'PhosphoSitePlus' (KSEAdb) https://www.phosphosite.org/
