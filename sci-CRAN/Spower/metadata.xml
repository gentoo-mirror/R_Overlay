		Power Analyses using Monte Carlo Simulations // Provides a
		general purpose simulation-based power analysis API for routine
		and customized simulation experimental designs. The package
		focuses exclusively on Monte Carlo simulation experiment
		variants of (expected) prospective power analyses, criterion
		analyses, compromise analyses, sensitivity analyses, and a
		priori/post-hoc analyses. The default simulation experiment
		functions defined within the package provide stochastic
		variants of the power analysis subroutines in G*Power 3.1
		(Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, and Lang, 2009)
		doi:10.3758/brm.41.4.1149, along with various other parametric
		and non-parametric power analysis applications (e.g., mediation
		analyses). Additional functions for building empirical power
		curves, reanalyzing simulation information, and for increasing
		the precision of the resulting power estimates are also
		included, each of which utilize similar API structures.
