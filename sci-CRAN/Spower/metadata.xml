		Power Analyses using Monte Carlo Simulations // Provides a
		general purpose simulation-based power analysis API for routine
		and customized simulation experimental designs. The package
		focuses exclusively on Monte Carlo simulation variants of
		(expected) prospective power analyses, criterion analyses,
		compromise analyses, sensitivity analyses, and a priori
		analyses. The default simulation experiment functions found
		within the package provide stochastic variants of the power
		analyses subroutines found in the G*Power 3.1 software (Faul,
		Erdfelder, Buchner, and Lang, 2009) doi:10.3758/brm.41.4.1149,
		along with various other parametric and non-parametric power
		analysis examples (e.g., mediation analyses). Supporting
		functions are also included, such as for building empirical
		power curve estimates, which utilize a similar API structure.
