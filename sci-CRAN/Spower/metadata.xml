		Power Analyses using Monte Carlo Simulations // Provides a
		general purpose simulation-based power analysis API for routine
		and customized simulation experimental designs. The package
		focuses exclusively on Monte Carlo simulation variants of
		(expected) prospective power analyses, criterion power
		analyses, compromise power analyses, sensitivity analyses, and
		prospective/post-hoc power analyses. The default simulation
		experiment functions found within the package provide
		stochastic variants of the power analyses subroutines found in
		the G*Power 3 software (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, and Lang,
		2009) doi:10.3758/brm.41.4.1149, along with various other power
		analysis examples (e.g., mediation analyses). Supporting
		functions are also included, such as for building empirical
		power curve estimates, which utilize a similar API structure.
