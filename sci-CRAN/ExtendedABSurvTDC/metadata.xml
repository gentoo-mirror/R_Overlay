		Survival Analysis using Indicators under Time Dependent
		Covariates // Survival analysis is employed to model time-to-
		event data. This package examines the relationship between
		survival and one or more predictors, termed as covariates,
		which can include both treatment variables (e.g., season of
		birth, represented by indicator functions) and continuous
		variables. To this end, the Cox-proportional hazard (Cox-PH)
		model, introduced by Cox in 1972, is a widely applicable and
		commonly used method for survival analysis. This package
		enables the estimation of the effect of randomization for the
		treatment variable to account for potential confounders,
		providing adjustment when estimating the association with
		exposure. It accommodates both fixed and time-dependent
		covariates and computes survival probabilities for lactation
		periods in dairy animals. The package is built upon the
		algorithm developed by Klein and Moeschberger (2003)
