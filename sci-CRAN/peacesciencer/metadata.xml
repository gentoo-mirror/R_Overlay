		Various Tools and Data for Quantitative Peace Science // These
		are useful tools and data sets for the study of quantitative
		peace science. The goal for this package is to include tools
		and data sets for doing original research that mimics well what
		a user would have to previously get from a software package
		that may not be well-sourced or well-supported. Those software
		bundles were useful the extent to which they encourage
		replications of long-standing analyses by starting the data-
		generating process from scratch. However, a lot of the
		functionality can be done relatively quickly and more
		transparently in the R programming language.
