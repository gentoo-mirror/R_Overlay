		Estimation of the log Likelihood of the Saturated Model // When
		the values of the outcome variable Y are either 0 or 1, the
		function lsm() calculates the estimation of the log likelihood
		in the saturated model. This model is characterized by Llinas
		(2006, ISSN:2389-8976) in section 2.3 through the assumptions 1
		and 2. The function LogLik() works (almost perfectly) when the
		number of independent variables K is high, but for small K it
		calculates wrong values in some cases. For this reason, when Y
		is dichotomous and the data are grouped in J populations, it is
		recommended to use the function lsm() because it works very
		well for all K.
