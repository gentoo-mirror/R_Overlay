		Calculate Urinary Saturation with the EQUIL2 Algorithm //
		Saturation of ionic substances in urine is calculated based on
		sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonia, chloride,
		phosphate, sulfate, oxalate, citrate, ph, and urate.  This
		program is intended for research use, only.  The code within is
		translated from EQUIL2 Visual Basic code based on Werness, et
		al (1985) "EQUIL2: a BASIC computer program for the calculation
		of urinary saturation" doi:10.1016/s0022-5347(17)47703-2 to R.
		The Visual Basic code was kindly provided by Dr. John Lieske of
		the Mayo Clinic.
