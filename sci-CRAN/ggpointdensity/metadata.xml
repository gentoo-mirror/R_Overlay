		A Cross Between a 2D Density Plot and a Scatter Plot // A cross
		between a 2D density plot and a scatter plot, implemented as a
		'ggplot2' geom. Points in the scatter plot are colored by the
		number of neighboring points. This is useful to visualize the
		2D-distribution of points in case of overplotting.
