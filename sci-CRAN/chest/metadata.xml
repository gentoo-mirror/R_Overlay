		Change-in-Estimate Approach to Assess Confounding Effects // The
		'chest' package applies the change-in-effect estimate method
		for assessing confounding effects in medical and
		epidemiological research. It starts with a crude model
		including only the outcome and exposure variables. At each of
		the subsequent steps, one variable which creates the largest
		change among the remaining variables is selected. This process
		is repeated until all variables have been entered into the
		model (Wang Z (2007) doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203).
		Currently, the 'chest' package has functions for linear
		regression, logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards model
		and conditional logistic regression.
