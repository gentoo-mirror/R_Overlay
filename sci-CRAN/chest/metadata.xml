		Change-in-Estimate Approach to Assess Confounding Effects //
		Applies the change-in-effect estimate method to assess
		confounding effects in medical and epidemiological research
		(Greenland  Pearce (2016) doi:10.1146/annurev-
		publhealth-031914-122559 ). It starts with a crude model
		including only the outcome and exposure variables. At each of
		the subsequent steps, one variable which creates the largest
		change among the remaining variables is selected. This process
		is repeated until all variables have been entered into the
		model (Wang Z (2007) doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203 ).
		Currently, the 'chest' package has functions for linear
		regression, logistic regression, negative binomial regression,
		Cox proportional hazards model and conditional logistic
		regression.
