		Regional Spatial Modeling with Continuous Borders //
		Automatically creates separate regression models for different
		spatial regions. The prediction surface is smoothed using a
		novel method developed by the package creator. If regional
		models are continuous, the resulting prediction surface is
		continuous across the spatial dimensions, even at region
		borders.
