		Regional Spatial Modeling with Continuous Borders //
		Automatically creates separate regression models for different
		spatial regions. The prediction surface is smoothed using a
		regional border smoothing method. If regional models are
		continuous, the resulting prediction surface is continuous
		across the spatial dimensions, even at region borders.
		Methodology is described in Wagstaff (2021)
		https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8065/.
