		Create and Query a Local 'PubTator' Database // 'PubTator'
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/PubTator/ is a
		National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) tool that
		enhances the annotation of articles on PubMed
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/. It makes it possible to
		rapidly identify potential relationships between genes or
		proteins using text mining techniques. In contrast, manually
		searching for and reading the annotated articles would be very
		time consuming. 'PubTator' offers both an online interface and
		a RESTful API, however, neither of these approaches are well
		suited for frequent, high-throughput analyses. The package
		'pubtatordb' provides a set of functions that make it easy for
		the average R user to download 'PubTator' annotations, create,
		and then query a local version of the database.
