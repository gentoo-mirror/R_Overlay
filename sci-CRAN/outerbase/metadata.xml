		Outer Product Regression // High-dimensional regression using
		outer product models.  Research on the methods is currently
		under investigation and published resources will be posted as
		they are available.  As the method is new, the website is the
		best resource for understanding the principals. Some of the
		core ideas are based on Plumlee and coauthors' work on analysis
		of grid-structured  experiments described in Plumlee (2014)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.900250 and  Plumlee, Erickson,
		Ankenman, Lawrence (2021) doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa084.  Some
		additional textbooks for additional information on Gaussian
		processes are Rasmussen and Williams (2005)
		doi:10.7551/mitpress/3206.001.0001 and  Gramacy (2022)
