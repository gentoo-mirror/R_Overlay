		Support Retrospective Harmonization of Data // Functions to
		support rigorous retrospective data harmonization processing,
		evaluation, and documentation across datasets from different
		studies based on Maelstrom Research guidelines. The package
		includes the core functions to evaluate and format the main
		inputs that define the harmonization process, apply specified
		processing rules to generate harmonized data, diagnose
		processing errors, and summarize and evaluate harmonized
		outputs. The main inputs that define the processing are a
		DataSchema (list and definitions of harmonized variables to be
		generated) and Data Processing Elements (processing rules to be
		applied to generate harmonized variables from study-specific
		variables). The main outputs of processing are harmonized
		datasets, associated metadata, and tabular and visual summary
		reports. As described in Maelstrom Research guidelines for
		rigorous retrospective data harmonization (Fortier I and al.
		(2017) doi:10.1093/ije/dyw075).
