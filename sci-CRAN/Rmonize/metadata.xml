		Tools for Data Harmonization // Integrated tools to support
		rigorous and well documented data harmonization based on
		Maelstrom Research guidelines. The package includes functions
		to assess and prepare input elements, apply specified
		processing rules to generate harmonized datasets, validate data
		processing and identify processing errors, and document and
		summarize harmonized outputs. The harmonization process is
		defined and structured by two key user-generated documents: the
		DataSchema (specifying the list of harmonized variables to
		generate across datasets) and the Data Processing Elements
		(specifying the input elements and processing algorithms to
		generate harmonized variables in DataSchema formats). The
		package was developed to address key  challenges of
		retrospective data harmonization in epidemiology (as described
		in Fortier I and al. (2017) doi:10.1093/ije/dyw075) but can be
		used for any data harmonization initiative.
