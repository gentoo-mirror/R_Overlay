		Biomarker Validation for Microbiome-Based Survival Classification
		and Prediction // An approach to identify microbiome biomarker
		for time to event data by discovering microbiome for predicting
		survival and classifying subjects into risk groups. Classifiers
		are constructed as a linear combination of important microbiome
		and treatment effects if necessary. Several methods were
		implemented to estimate the microbiome risk score such as the
		LASSO method by Robert Tibshirani (1998)
		doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19970228)16:4%3C385::AID-
		SIM380%3E3.0.CO;2-3, Elastic net approach by Hui Zou and Trevor
		Hastie (2005) doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x, supervised
		principle component analysis of Wold Svante et al. (1987)
		doi:10.1016/0169-7439(87)80084-9, and supervised partial least
		squares analysis by Inge S. Helland
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/4616159. Sensitivity analysis on
		the quantile used for the classification can also be accessed
		to check the deviation of the classification group based on the
		quantile specified. Large scale cross validation can be
		performed in order to investigate the mostly selected
		microbiome and for internal validation. During the evaluation
		process, validation is accessed using the hazard ratios (HR)
		distribution of the test set and inference is mainly based on
		resampling and permutations technique.
