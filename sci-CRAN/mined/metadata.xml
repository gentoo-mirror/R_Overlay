		Minimum Energy Designs // This is a method (MinED) for mining
		probability distributions using deterministic sampling which is
		proposed by Joseph, Wang, Gu, Lv, and Tuo (2019)
		DOI:10.1080/00401706.2018.1552203. The MinED samples can be
		used for approximating the target distribution. They can be
		generated from a density function that is known only up to a
		proportionality constant and thus, it might find applications
		in Bayesian computation. Moreover, the MinED samples are
		generated with much fewer evaluations of the density function
		compared to random sampling-based methods such as MCMC and
		therefore, this method will be especially useful when the
		unnormalized posterior is expensive or time consuming to
		evaluate. This research is supported by a U.S. National Science
		Foundation grant DMS-1712642.
