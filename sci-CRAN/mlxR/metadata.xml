		Simulation of Longitudinal Data // Simulation and visualization
		of complex models for longitudinal data. The models are encoded
		using the model coding language 'Mlxtran' and automatically
		converted into C++ codes. That allows one to implement very
		easily complex ODE-based models and complex statistical models,
		including mixed effects models, for continuous, count,
		categorical, and time-to-event data.
