		FDR Power // This is a package for calculating two differing
		notions of power, or deriving sample sizes for specified
		requisite power in multiple testing experiments under a variety
		of methods for control of the distribution of the False
		Discovery Proportion (FDP). More specifically, one can choose
		to control the FDP distribution according to control of its (i)
		mean, e.g. the usual BH-FDR procedure, or via the probability
		that it exceeds a given value, delta, via (ii) the Romano
		procedure, or via (iii) my procedure based upon asymptotic
		approximation. Likewise, we can think of the power in multiple
		testing experiments in terms of a summary of the distribution
		of the True Positive Proportion (TPP). The package will compute
		power, sample size or any other missing parameter required for
		power based upon (i) the mean of the TPP which is the average
		power (ii) the probability that the TPP exceeds a given value,
		lambda, via my asymptotic approximation procedure. The
		theoretical results are described in Izmirlian, G. (2020) Stat.
		and Prob. letters, doi:10.1016/j.spl.2020.108713, and an
		applied  paper describing the methodology with a simulation
		study is in preparation.
