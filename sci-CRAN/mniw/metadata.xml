		The Matrix-Normal Inverse-Wishart Distribution // Density
		evaluation and random number generation for the Matrix-Normal
		Inverse-Wishart (MNIW) distribution, as well as the the Matrix-
		Normal, Matrix-T, Wishart, and Inverse-Wishart distributions.
		Core calculations are implemented in a portable (header-only)
		C++ library, with matrix manipulations using the 'Eigen'
		library for linear algebra.  Also provided is a Gibbs sampler
		for Bayesian inference on a random-effects model with
		multivariate normal observations.
