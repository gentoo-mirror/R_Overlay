		Extended Rosenbrock-Type Densities for Markov Chain Monte Carlo
		(MCMC) Sampler Benchmarking // New Markov chain Monte Carlo
		(MCMC) samplers new to be thoroughly tested and their
		performance accurately assessed. This requires densities that
		offer challenging properties to the novel sampling algorithms.
		One such popular problem is the Rosenbrock function. However,
		while its shape lends itself well to a benchmark problem, no
		codified multivariate expansion of the density exists. We have
		developed an extension to this class of distributions and
		supplied densities and direct sampler functions to assess the
		performance of novel MCMC algorithms. The functions are
		introduced in "An n-dimensional Rosenbrock Distribution for
		MCMC Testing" by Pagani, Wiegand and Nadarajah (2019)
		arXiv:1903.09556.
