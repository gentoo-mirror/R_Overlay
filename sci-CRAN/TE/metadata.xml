		Insertion/Deletion Dynamics for Transposable Elements // Provides
		functions to estimate the insertion and deletion rates of
		transposable element (TE) families. The estimation of insertion
		rate consists of an improved estimate of the age distribution
		that takes into account random mutations, and an adjustment by
		the deletion rate. A hypothesis test for a uniform insertion
		rate is also implemented. This package implements the methods
		proposed in Dai et al (2018).
