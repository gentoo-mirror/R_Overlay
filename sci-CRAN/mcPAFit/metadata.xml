		Estimating Preferential Attachment from a Single Network Snapshot
		by Markov Chain Monte Carlo // A Markov chain Monte Carlo
		method is provided to estimate the preferential attachment
		function from a single network snapshot. Conventional methods
		require the complete information about the appearance order of
		all nodes and edges in the network. This package incorporates
		the appearance order into the state space and estimates it
		together with the preferential attachment function.
