		Sample Generalized Random Dot Product Graphs in Linear Time //
		Samples generalized random product graphs, a generalization of
		a broad class of network models. Given matrices X, S, and Y
		with with non-negative entries, samples a matrix with
		expectation X S Y^T and independent Poisson or Bernoulli
		entries using the fastRG algorithm of Rohe et al. (2017)
		https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v19/17-128.html. The algorithm
		first samples the number of edges and then puts them down one-
		by-one.  As a result it is O(m) where m is the number of edges,
		a dramatic improvement over element-wise algorithms that which
		require O(n^2) operations to sample a random graph, where n is
		the number of nodes.
