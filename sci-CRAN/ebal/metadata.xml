		Entropy Reweighting to Create Balanced Samples // Package
		implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing procedure
		described in Hainmueller (2008, doi:10.1093/pan/mpr025) that
		allows users to reweight a dataset such that the covariate
		distributions in the reweighted data satisfy a set of user
		specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create
		balanced samples in observational studies with a binary
		treatment where the control group data can be reweighted to
		match the covariate moments in the treatment group. Entropy
		balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample to known
		characteristics from a target population.
