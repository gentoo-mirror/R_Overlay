		Extremely Fast Implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier // This
		is an extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes
		classifier. This package is currently the only package that
		supports a Bernoulli distribution, a Multinomial distribution,
		and a Gaussian distribution, making it suitable for both binary
		features, frequency counts, and numerical features. Another
		feature is the support of a mix of different event models. Only
		numerical variables are allowed, however, categorical variables
		can be transformed into dummies and used with the Bernoulli
		distribution. The implementation is largely based on the paper
		"A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes anti-spam e-mail
		filtering" written by K.M. Schneider (2003)
		doi:10.3115/1067807. Any issues can be submitted to:
		https://github.com/mskogholt/fastNaiveBayes/issues.
