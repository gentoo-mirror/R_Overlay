		Extremely Fast Implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier // This
		is an extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes
		classifier. This package is currently the only package that
		supports a Bernoulli distribution, a Multinomial distribution,
		and a Gaussian distribution, making it suitable for both binary
		features, frequency counts, and numerical features. Another
		unique feature is the support of a mix of different event
		models. Only numerical variables are allowed, however,
		categorical variables can be transformed into dummies and used
		with the Bernoulli distribution. This implementation offers a
		huge performance gain compared to the 'e1071' implementation in
		R. The execution times were compared on a data set of tweets
		and was found to be around 1135 times faster. Compared to other
		implementations the minimum speed up was found to be 12.5 times
		faster for the Bernoulli distribution. See the vignette for
		more details. This performance gain is only realized using a
		Bernoulli event model. Furthermore, the Multinomial event model
		implementation is even slightly faster, but incomparable since
		it was not implemented in 'e1071'. Compared to other
		implementations of a Multinomial distribution, this package was
		found to give a speed up of 12.2 times. The implementation is
		largely based on the paper "A comparison of event models for
		Naive Bayes anti-spam e-mail filtering" written by K.M.
		Schneider (2003) doi:10.3115/1067807. Any issues can be
