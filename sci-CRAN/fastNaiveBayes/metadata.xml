		Extremely Fast Implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier // This
		is an extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes
		classifier. The package currently supports a Bernoulli
		distribution, a Multinomial distribution, and a Gaussian
		distribution, making it suitable for both binary features,
		frequency counts, and numerical features. Only numerical
		variables are allowed, however, categorical variables can be
		transformed into dummies and used with the Bernoulli
		distribution. The implementation is based on the paper "A
		comparison of event models for Naive Bayes anti-spam e-mail
		filtering" written by K.M. Schneider (2003)
		doi:10.3115/1067807. This implementation offers a huge
		performance gain compared to the 'e1071' implementation in R.
		The execution times were compared on a data set of tweets and
		was found to be 331 times faster. See the vignette for more
		details. This performance gain is only realized using a
		Bernoulli event model. Furthermore, the Multinomial event model
		is equally fast and available in contrast to 'e1071'.
