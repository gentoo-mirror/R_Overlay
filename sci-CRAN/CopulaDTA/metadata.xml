		Copula Based Bivariate Beta-Binomial Model for Diagnostic Test
		Accuracy Studies // Modelling of sensitivity and specificity on
		their natural scale using copula based bivariate beta-binomial
		distribution to yield marginal mean sensitivity and
		specificity. The intrinsic negative correlation between
		sensitivity and specificity is modelled using a copula
		function. A forest plot can be obtained for categorical
		covariates or for the model with intercept only. Nyaga VN,
