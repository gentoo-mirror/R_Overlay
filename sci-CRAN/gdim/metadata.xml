		Estimate Graph Dimension using Cross-Validated Eigenvalues //
		Cross-validated eigenvalues are estimated by splitting a graph
		into two parts, the training and the test graph. The training
		graph is used to estimate eigenvectors, and the test graph is
		used to evaluate the correlation between the training
		eigenvectors and the eigenvectors of the test graph. The
		correlations follow a simple central limit theorem that can be
		used to estimate graph dimension via hypothesis testing, see
		Chen et al. (2021) arXiv:2108.03336 for details.
