		Simulates LOX Drop Testing // Generates simulated data
		representing the LOX drop testing process (also known as impact
		testing). A simulated process allows for accelerated study of
		test behavior. Functions are provided to simulate trials, test
		series, and groups of test series. Functions for creating plots
		specific to this process are also included. Test attributes and
		criteria can be set arbitrarily. This work is not endorsed by
		or affiliated with NASA. See "ASTM G86-17, Standard Test Method
		for Determining Ignition Sensitivity of Materials to Mechanical
		Impact in Ambient Liquid Oxygen and Pressurized Liquid and
		Gaseous Oxygen Environments" doi:10.1520/G0086-17.
