		Linear and Smooth Predictor Modelling with Penalisation and
		Variable Selection // Fit a model with potentially many linear
		and smooth predictors. Interaction effects can also be
		quantified. Variable selection is done using penalisation. For
		l1-type penalties we use iterative steps alternating between
		using linear predictors (lasso) and smooth predictors
		(generalised additive model).
