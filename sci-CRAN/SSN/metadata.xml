		Spatial Modeling on Stream Networks // Spatial statistical
		modeling and prediction for data on stream networks, including
		models based on in-stream distance (Ver Hoef, J.M. and
		Peterson, E.E., 2010. DOI:10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08248.) Models
		are created using moving average constructions. Spatial linear
		models, including explanatory variables, can be fit with
		(restricted) maximum likelihood.  Mapping and other graphical
		functions are included.
