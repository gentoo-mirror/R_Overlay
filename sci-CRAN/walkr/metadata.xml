		Random Walks in the Intersection of Hyperplanes and the N-Simplex
		// Consider the intersection of two spaces: the complete
		solution space to Ax = b and the N-simplex. The intersection of
		these two spaces is a non-negative convex polytope. The package
		walkr samples from this intersection using two Monte-Carlo
		Markov Chain (MCMC) methods: hit-and-run and Dikin walk. walkr
		also provide tools to examine sample quality. The package
		implements Dikin walk specified in Sachdeva (2016)
