		Multiple Imputation Random Lasso for Variable Selection with
		Missing Entries // Implements a variable selection and
		prediction method for high-dimensional data with missing
		entries following the paper Liu et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1214/15-AOAS899. It deals with missingness by multiple
		imputation and produces a selection probability for each
		variable following stability selection. The user can further
		choose a threshold for the selection probability to select a
		final set of variables. The threshold can be picked by cross
		validation or the user can define a practical threshold for
		selection probability. If you find this work useful for your
		application, please cite the method paper.
