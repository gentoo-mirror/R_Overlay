		A Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Clustering Longitudinal
		Gene Expression Data // Many clustering methods have been
		proposed, but most of them cannot work for longitudinal gene
		expression data. 'BClustLonG' is a package that allows us to
		perform clustering analysis for longitudinal gene expression
		data. It adopts a linear-mixed effects framework to model the
		trajectory of genes over time, while clustering is jointly
		conducted based on the regression coefficients obtained from
		all genes. To account for the correlations among genes and
		alleviate the high dimensionality challenges, factor analysis
		models are adopted for the regression coefficients. The
		Dirichlet process prior distribution is utilized for the means
		of the regression coefficients to induce clustering. This
		package allows users to specify which variables to use for
		clustering (intercepts or slopes or both) and whether a factor
		analysis model is desired. More details about this method can
		be found in Jiehuan Sun, et al. (2017) doi:10.1002/sim.7374.
