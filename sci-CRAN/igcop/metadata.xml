		Computational Tools for the IG and IGL Copula Families // Compute
		distributional quantities for an Integrated Gamma (IG) or
		Integrated Gamma Limit (IGL) copula, such as a cdf and density.
		Compute corresponding conditional quantities such as the cdf
		and quantiles. Generate data from an IG or IGL copula. See the
		vignette for formulas, or for a derivation, see Coia, V (2017)
		"Forecasting of Nonlinear Extreme Quantiles Using Copula
		Models." PhD Dissertation, The University of British Columbia.
