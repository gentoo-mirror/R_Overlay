		Normalizing Transformation Functions // Estimate a suite of
		normalizing transformations, including a new technique based on
		ranks which can guarantee normally distributed transformed data
		if there are no ties: Ordered Quantile Normalization. The
		package is built to estimate the best normalizing
		transformation for a vector consistently and accurately. It
		implements the Box-Cox transformation, the Yeo-Johnson
		transformation, three types of Lambert WxF transformations, and
		the Ordered Quantile normalization transformation.
