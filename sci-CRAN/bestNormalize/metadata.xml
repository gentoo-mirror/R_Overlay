		Normalizing Transformation Functions // Estimate a suite of
		normalizing transformations, including a new adaptation of a
		technique based on ranks which can guarantee normally
		distributed transformed data if there are no ties: ordered
		quantile normalization (ORQ). ORQ normalization combines a
		rank-mapping approach with a shifted logit approximation that
		allows the transformation to work on data outside the original
		domain. It is also able to handle new data within the original
		domain via linear interpolation. The package is built to
		estimate the best normalizing transformation for a vector
		consistently and accurately. It implements the Box-Cox
		transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation, three types of
		Lambert WxF transformations, and the ordered quantile
		normalization transformation. It estimates the normalization
		efficacy of other commonly used transformations, and it allows
		users to specify custom transformations or normalization
		statistics. Finally, functionality can be integrated into a
		machine learning workflow via recipes.
