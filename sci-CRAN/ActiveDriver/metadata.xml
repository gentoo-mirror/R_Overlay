		Finding Cancer Driver Proteins with Enriched Mutations in Post-
		Translational Modification Sites // A mutation analysis tool
		that discovers cancer driver genes with frequent mutations in
		protein signalling sites such as post-translational
		modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, etc). The
		Poisson generalised linear regression model identifies genes
		where cancer mutations in signalling sites are more frequent
		than expected from the sequence of the entire gene. Integration
		of mutations with signalling information helps find new driver
		genes and propose candidate mechanisms to known drivers.
		Reference: Systematic analysis of somatic mutations in
		phosphorylation signaling predicts novel cancer drivers. Juri
