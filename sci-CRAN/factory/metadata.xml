		Build Function Factories // Function factories are functions that
		make functions. They can be confusing to construct.
		Straightforward techniques can produce functions that are
		fragile or hard to understand. While more robust techniques
		exist to construct function factories, those techniques can be
		confusing. This package is designed to make it easier to
		construct function factories.
