		Correct and Cluster Response Style Biased Data // Functions for
		performing Correcting and Clustering response-style-biased
		preference data (CCRS). The main functions are correct.RS() for
		correcting for response styles, and ccrs() for simultaneously
		correcting and content-based clustering. The procedure begin
		with making rank-ordered boundary data from the given
		preference matrix using a function called create.ccrsdata().
		Then in correct.RS(), the response style is corrected as
		follows: the rank-ordered boundary data are smoothed by
		I-spline functions, the given preference data are transformed
		by the smoothed functions. The resulting data matrix, which is
		considered as bias-corrected data, can be used for any data
		analysis methods. If one wants to cluster respondents based on
		their indicated preferences (content-based clustering), ccrs()
		can be applied to the given (response-style-biased) preference
		data, which simultaneously corrects for response styles and
		clusters respondents based on the contents. Also, the
		correction result can be checked by plot.crs() function.
