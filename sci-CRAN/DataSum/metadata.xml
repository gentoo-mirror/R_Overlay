		Comprehensive Data Summarization for Statistical Analysis //
		Summarizing data frames by calculating various statistical
		measures, including measures of central tendency, dispersion,
		skewness(), kurtosis(), and normality tests. The package
		leverages the 'moments' package for calculating statistical
		moments and related measures, the 'dplyr' package for data
		manipulation, and the 'nortest' package for normality testing.
		'DataSum' includes functions such as getmode() for finding the
		mode(s) of a data vector, shapiro_normality_test() for
		performing the Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro  Wilk 1965
		doi:10.1093/biomet/52.3-4.591) (or the Anderson-Darling test
		when the data length is outside the valid range for the
		Shapiro-Wilk test) (Stephens 1974
		doi:10.1080/01621459.1974.10480196), Datum() for generating a
		comprehensive summary of a data vector with various statistics
		(including data type, sample size, mean, mode, median,
		variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, range,
		skewness(), kurtosis(), and normality test result) (Joanes
		Gill 1998 doi:10.1111/1467-9884.00122), and DataSumm() for
		applying the Datum() function to each column of a data frame.
		Emphasizing the importance of normality testing, the package
		provides robust tools to validate whether data follows a normal
		distribution, a fundamental assumption in many statistical
		analyses and models.
