		Quantile-Optimal Treatment Regimes with Censored Data // Provides
		methods for estimation of mean- and quantile-optimal treatment
		regimes from censored data. Specifically, we have developed
		distinct functions for three types of right censoring for
		static treatment using quantile criterion: (1)
		independent/random censoring, (2) treatment-dependent random
		censoring, and (3) covariates-dependent random censoring. It
		also includes a function to estimate quantile-optimal dynamic
		treatment regimes for independent censored data. Finally, this
		package also includes a simulation data generative model of a
		dynamic treatment experiment proposed in literature.
