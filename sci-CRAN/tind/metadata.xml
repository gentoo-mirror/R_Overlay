		A Common Representation of Time Indices of Different Types //
		Provides an easy-to-use tind class representing time indices of
		different types (years, quarters, months, ISO 8601 weeks,
		dates, time of day, date-time, and arbitrary integer/numeric
		indices). Includes an extensive collection of functions for
		calendrical computations (including business applications),
		index conversions, index parsing, and other operations.
		Auxiliary classes representing time differences and time
		intervals (with set operations and index matching
		functionality) are also provided. All routines have been
		optimised for speed in order to facilitate computations on
		large datasets. More details regarding calendars in general and
		calendrical algorithms can be found in "Calendar FAQ" by Claus
		Tndering https://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html.
