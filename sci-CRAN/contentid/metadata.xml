		An Interface for Content-Based Identifiers // An interface for
		creating, registering, and resolving content-based identifiers
		for data management. Content-based identifiers rely on the
		'cryptographic' hashes to refer to the files they identify,
		thus, anyone possessing the file can compute the identifier
		using a well-known standard algorithm, such as 'SHA256'.  By
		registering a URL at which the content is accessible to a
		public archive (such as Hash Archive) or depositing data in a
		scientific repository such 'Zenodo', 'DataONE' or
		'SoftwareHeritage', the content identifier can serve many
		functions typically associated with A Digital Object Identifier
		('DOI').  Unlike location-based identifiers like 'DOIs',
		content-based identifiers permit the same content to be
		registered in many locations.
