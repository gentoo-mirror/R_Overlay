		Simulate Longitudinal Dataset with Time-Varying Correlated
		Covariates // Flexibly simulates a dataset with time-varying
		covariates with user-specified exchangeable correlation
		structures across and within clusters. Covariates can be normal
		or binary and can be static within a cluster or time-varying.
		Time-varying normal variables can optionally have linear
		trajectories within each cluster. See ?make_one_dataset for the
		main wrapper function. See Montez-Rath et al. arXiv:1709.10074
		for methodological details.
