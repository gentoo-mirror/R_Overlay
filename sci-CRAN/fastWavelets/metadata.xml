		Compute Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and
		Trous Discrete Wavelet Transform // A lightweight package to
		compute Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and
		Trous Discrete Wavelet Transform by leveraging the power of
		'Rcpp' to make these operations fast. This package was designed
		for use in forecasting, and allows users avoid the inclusion of
		future data when performing wavelet decomposition of time
		series. See Quilty and Adamowski (2018)
