		Burden Estimate of Common Communicable Diseases in Settlements of
		Displaced Populations // Provides a practical tool for
		estimating the burden of common communicable diseases in
		settlements of displaced populations. An online version of the
		tool can be found at http://who-refugee-
		bod.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/shiny/app/. Estimates of burden of disease
		aim to synthesize data about cause-specific morbidity and
		mortality through a systematic approach that enables evidence-
		based decisions and comparisons across settings. The focus of
		this tool is on four acute communicable diseases and syndromes,
		including Acute respiratory infections, Acute diarrheal
		diseases, Acute jaundice syndrome and Acute febrile illnesses.
