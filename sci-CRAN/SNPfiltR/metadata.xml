		Interactively Filter SNP Datasets // Is designed to interactively
		and reproducibly visualize and filter SNP (single-nucleotide
		polymorphism) datasets. This R-based implementation of SNP and
		genotype filters facilitates an interactive and iterative SNP
		filtering pipeline, which can be documented reproducibly via
		Rmarkdown. 'SNPfiltR' contains functions for visualizing
		various quality and missing data metrics for a SNP dataset, and
		then filtering the dataset based on user specified cutoffs. All
		functions take 'vcfR' objects as input, which can easily be
		generated by reading standard vcf (variant call format) files
		into R using the R package 'vcfR' (Knaus and Grnwald)
		(doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12549). Each 'SNPfiltR' function can
		return a newly filtered vcfR object, which can then be written
		to a local directory in standard vcf format using the 'vcfR'
		package, for downstream population genetic and phylogenetic
		analyses.
