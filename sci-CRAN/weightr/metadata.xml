		Estimating Weight-Function Models for Publication Bias //
		Estimates the Vevea and Hedges (1995) weight-function model. By
		specifying arguments, users can also estimate the modified
		model described in Vevea and Woods (2005), which may be more
		practical with small datasets. Users can also specify
		moderators to estimate a linear model. The package
		functionality allows users to easily extract the results of
		these analyses as R objects for other uses. In addition, the
		package includes a function to launch both models as a Shiny
		application. Although the Shiny application is also available
		online, this function allows users to launch it locally if they
		choose.
