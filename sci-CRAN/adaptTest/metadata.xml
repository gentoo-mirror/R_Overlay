		Adaptive Two-Stage Tests // The functions defined in this program
		serve for implementing adaptive two-stage tests. Currently,
		four tests are included: Bauer and Koehne (1994), Lehmacher and
		Wassmer (1999), Vandemeulebroecke (2006), and the horizontal
		conditional error function. User-defined tests can also be
		implemented. Reference: Vandemeulebroecke, An investigation of
		two-stage tests, Statistica Sinica 2006.
