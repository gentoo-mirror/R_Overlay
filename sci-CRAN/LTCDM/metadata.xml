		Latent Transition Cognitive Diagnosis Model with Covariates //
		Implementation of the three-step approach of latent transition
		cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) with covariates. This approach
		can be used to assess changes in attribute mastery status and
		to evaluate the covariate effects on both the initial states
		and transition probabilities over time using latent logistic
		regression. Because stepwise approaches often yield biased
		estimates, correction for classification error probabilities
		(CEPs) is considered in this approach. The three-step approach
		for latent transition CDM with covariates involves the
		following steps: (1) fitting a CDM to the response data without
		covariates at each time point separately, (2) assigning
		examinees to latent states at each time point and computing the
		associated CEPs, and (3) estimating the latent transition CDM
		with the known CEPs and computing the regression coefficients.
		The method was proposed in Liang et al. (2023)
		doi:10.3102/10769986231163320 and demonstrated using mental
		health data in Liang et al. (in press; annotated R code and
		data utilized in this example are available in Mendeley data)
		doi:10.17632/kpjp3gnwbt.1.
