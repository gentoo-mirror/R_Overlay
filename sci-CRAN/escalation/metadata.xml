		Modular Approach to Dose Finding Clinical Trials // Methods for
		working with dose-finding clinical trials. We start by
		providing a common interface to various dose-finding
		methodologies like the continual reassessment method (CRM) by
		O'Quigley et al. (1990) doi:10.2307/2531628, the Bayesian
		optimal interval design (BOIN) by Liu  Yuan (2015)
		doi:10.1111/rssc.12089, and the 3+3 described by Korn et al.
		(1994) doi:10.1002/sim.4780131802. We then add optional
		embellishments to provide extra desirable behaviour, like
		avoiding skipping doses, stopping after n patients have been
		treated at the recommended dose, or demanding that n patients
		are treated before stopping is allowed. By daisy-chaining
		together these embellishments using the pipe operator from
		'magrittr', it is simple to tailor the behaviour of dose-
		finding designs so that they do what you want. Furthermore,
		using this flexible interface for creating dose-finding
		designs, it is simple to run simulations or calculate dose-
		pathways for future cohorts of patients.
