		Ordered Homogeneity Pursuit Lasso for Group Variable Selection //
		Ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso (OHPL) algorithm for group
		variable selection proposed in Lin et al. (2017)
		DOI:10.1016/j.chemolab.2017.07.004. The OHPL method exploits
		the homogeneity structure in high-dimensional data and enjoys
		the grouping effect to select groups of important variables
		automatically. This feature makes it particularly useful for
		high-dimensional datasets with strongly correlated variables,
		such as spectroscopic data.
