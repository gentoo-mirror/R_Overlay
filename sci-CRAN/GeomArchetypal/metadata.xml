		Finds the Geometrical Archetypal Analysis of a Data Frame //
		Performs Geometrical Archetypal Analysis after creating Grid
		Archetypes which are the Cartesian Product of all minimum,
		maximum variable values. Since the archetypes are fixed now, we
		have the ability to compute the convex composition coefficients
		for all our available data points much faster by using the half
		part of Principal Convex Hull Archetypal method. Additionally
		we can decide to keep as archetypes the closer to the Grid
		Archetypes ones. Finally the number of archetypes is always 2
		to the power of the dimension of our data points if we consider
		them as a vector space. Cutler, A., Breiman, L. (1994)
