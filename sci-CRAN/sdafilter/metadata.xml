		Symmetrized Data Aggregation // We develop a new class of
		distribution free multiple testing rules for false discovery
		rate (FDR) control under general dependence. A key element in
		our proposal is a symmetrized data aggregation (SDA) approach
		to incorporating the dependence structure via sample splitting,
		data screening and information pooling. The proposed SDA filter
		first constructs a sequence of ranking statistics that fulfill
		global symmetry properties, and then chooses a data driven
		threshold along the ranking to control the FDR. For more
		information, see the website below and the accompanying paper:
		Du et al. (2020), "False Discovery Rate Control Under General
		Dependence By Symmetrized Data Aggregation", arXiv:2002.11992.
