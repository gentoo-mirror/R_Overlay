		Simulating Longitudinal Data with Causal Inference Applications
		// A flexible tool for simulating complex longitudinal data
		using structural equations, with emphasis on problems in causal
		inference. Specify interventions and simulate from intervened
		data generating distributions. Define and evaluate treatment-
		specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients
		from working marginal structural models. User interface
		designed to facilitate the conduct of transparent and
		reproducible simulation studies, and allows concise expression
		of complex functional dependencies for a large number of time-
		varying nodes. See the package vignette for more information,
		documentation and examples.
