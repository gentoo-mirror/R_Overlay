		Covariate Adaptive Clustering // Implements the predictive
		k-means method for clustering observations, using a mixture of
		experts model to allow covariates to influence cluster centers.
		Motivated by air pollution epidemiology settings, where cluster
		membership needs to be predicted across space. Includes
		functions for predicting cluster membership using spatial
		splines and principal component analysis (PCA) scores using
		either multinomial logistic regression or support vector
		machines (SVMs). For method details see Keller et al. (2017)
