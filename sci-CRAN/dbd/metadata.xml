		Versatile Discrete Distributions // Tools for working with a new
		family of versatile discrete distributions, the db
		("discretised Beta") family. This package provides density
		(probability), distribution, inverse distribution (quantile)
		and random data generation functions for the db family.  It
		provides functions to effect conveniently maximum likelihood
		estimation of parameters, and a variety of useful plotting
		functions.  It provides goodness of fit tests and functions to
		calculate the Fisher information, different estimates of the
		hessian of the log likelihood and Monte Carlo estimation of the
		covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood parameter
		estimates.
