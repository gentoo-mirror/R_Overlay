		Discretised Beta Distribution // Tools for working with a new
		versatile discrete distribution, the db ("discretised Beta")
		distribution.  This package provides density (probability),
		distribution, inverse distribution (quantile) and random data
		generation functions for the db family.  It provides functions
		to effect conveniently maximum likelihood estimation of
		parameters, and a variety of useful plotting functions.  It
		provides goodness of fit tests and functions to calculate the
		Fisher information, different estimates of the hessian of the
		log likelihood and Monte Carlo estimation of the covariance
		matrix of the maximum likelihood parameter estimates.  In
		addition it provides analogous tools for working with the beta-
		binomial distribution which has been proposed as a competitor
		to the db distribution.
