		'SaTScan' (TM) Results Mapper // Supports the generation of maps
		based on the results from 'SaTScan' (TM) cluster analysis. The
		package handles mapping of Spatial and Spatial-Time analysis
		using the discrete Poisson, Bernoulli, and exponential models
		of case data generating cluster and location ('GIS') records
		containing observed, expected and observed/expected ratio for
		U. S. states (and DC), counties or census tracts of individual
		states based on the U. S. 'FIPS' codes for state, county and
		census tracts (locations) using 2000 or 2010 Census areas,
		'FIPS' codes, and boundary data. 'satscanMapper' uses the
		'SeerMapper' package for the boundary data and mapping of
		locations.  Not all of the 'SaTScan' (TM) analysis and models
		generate the observed, expected and observed/expected ratio
		values for the clusters and locations. The user can map the
		observed/expected ratios for locations (states, counties, or
		census tracts) for each cluster with a p-value less than 0.05
		or a user specified p-value. The locations are categorized and
		colored based on either the cluster's Observed/Expected ratio
		or the locations' Observed/Expected ratio. The place names are
		provided for each census tract using data from 'NCI', the 'HUD'
		crossover tables (Tract to Zip code) as of December, 2013, the
		USPS Zip code 5 database for 1999, and manual look ups on the
		USPS.gov web site.
