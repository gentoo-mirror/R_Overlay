		Utilities for Convenient Extraction of Medical Image Metadata //
		A collection of utilities for navigating medical image data.
		The DICOM and NIfTI formats are supported. Functions provide
		simple interfaces to the data and metadata contained in these
		formats. A particular emphasis on metadata allows simple
		conversion of image metadata to familiar R data structures such
		as lists and data frames. Where possible, generic functions can
		silently process either DICOM or NIfTI data. Additionally,
		image data can be extracted and viewed.
