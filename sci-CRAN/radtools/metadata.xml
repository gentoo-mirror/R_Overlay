		Utilities for Smooth Navigation of Medical Image Data // A
		collection of utilities for navigating medical image data. The
		DICOM and NIfTI formats are supported. Functions provide simple
		interfaces to the data and metadata contained in these formats.
		A particular emphasis on metadata allows simple conversion of
		image metadata to familiar R data structures such as lists and
		data frames. Where possible, generic functions can silently
		process either DICOM or NIfTI data. Additionally, image data
		can be extracted and viewed.
