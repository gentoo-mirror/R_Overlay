		The Gaussian Covariate Method for Variable Selection // The
		standard linear regression theory whether frequentist or
		Bayesian is based on an 'assumed (revealed?) truth' (John
		Tukey) attitude to models.  This is reflected in the language
		of statistical inference which involves a concept of truth, for
		example confidence intervals, hypothesis testing  and
		consistency. The motivation behind this package was to remove
		the word true from the theory and practice of linear regression
		and to replace it by approximation. The approximations
		considered are the least squares approximations. An
		approximation is called valid if it contains no irrelevant
		covariates. This is operationalized using the concept of a
		Gaussian P-value which is the probability that pure Gaussian
		noise is better in term of least squares than the covariate.
		The precise definition given in the paper, it  is intuitive and
		requires only four simple equations. Its overwhelming advantage
		compared with a standard F P-value is that is is exact and
		valid whatever the data. In contrast F P-values are only valid
		for specially designed simulations. Given this a valid
		approximation is one where all the Gaussian P-values are less
		than a threshold p0 specified by the statistician, in this
		package with the default value 0.01. This approximations
		approach is not only much simpler it is overwhelmingly better
		than the standard model based approach. The  will be
		demonstrated using six real data sets, four from high
		dimensional regression and two from vector autoregression. The
		simplicity and superiority of Gaussian P-values derive from
		their universal exactness and validity. This is in complete
		contrast to standard F P-values which are valid only for
		carefully designed simulations. The function f1st is the most
		important function. It is a greedy forward selection procedure
		which results in either just one or no approximations which may
		however not be valid. If the size is less than than a threshold
		with default value 21 then an all subset procedure is called
		which returns  the best valid subset. A good default start is
		f1st(y,x,kmn=15) The best function for returning multiple
		approximations is  f3st which repeatedly calls f1st.  For more
		information see the web site below and the accompanying papers:
