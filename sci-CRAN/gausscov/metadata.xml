		The Gaussian Covariate Method for Variable Selection // Given the
		standard linear model the traditional way of deciding whether
		to include the jth covariate is to apply the F-test to decide
		whether the corresponding beta coefficient is  zero. The
		Gaussian covariate method is completely different. The question
		as to whether the beta coefficient is or is not zero is
		replaced by the question as to whether the covariate is better
		or worse than i.i.d. Gaussian noise. The P-value for the
		covariate is the probability that Gaussian noise is better.
		Surprisingly this can be given exactly and it is the same a the
		P-value for the classical model based on the F-distribution.
		The Gaussian covariate P-value is model free, it is the same
		for any data set. Using the idea it is possible to do covariate
		selection for a small number of covariates 25 by considering
		all subsets.  Post selection inference causes no problems as
		the P-values hold whatever the data. The idea extends to
		stepwise regression again with exact probabilities. In the
		simplest version the only parameter is a specified cut-off
		P-value which can be interpreted as the probability of a false
		positive being included in the final selection. For more
		information see the web site below and the accompanying papers:

		Model-free Approach to Linear Regression with Exact
		Probabilities", 2022, arxiv:2202.01553. L. Davies, "Linear
		Regression, Covariate Selection and the Failure of Modelling",
