		The Gaussian Covariate Method for Variable Selection // The
		standard linear regression theory whether frequentist or
		Bayesian is based on an 'assumed (revealed?) truth' (John
		Tukey) attitude to models. This is reflected in the language of
		statistical inference which involves a concept of truth, for
		example confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and
		consistency. The motivation behind this package was to remove
		the word true from the theory and practice of linear regression
		and to replace it by approximation. The approximations
		considered are the least squares approximations. An
		approximation is called valid if it contains no irrelevant
		covariates. This is operationalized using the concept of a
		Gaussian P-value which is the probability that pure Gaussian
		noise is better in term of least squares than the covariate.
		The precise definition given in the paper  "An Approximation
		Based Theory of Linear Regression".  Only four simple equations
		are required. Moreover the Gaussian P-values can be simply
		derived from standard F P-values. Furthermore they are exact
		and valid whatever the data in contrast F P-values are only
		valid for specially designed simulations. A valid approximation
		is one where all the Gaussian P-values are less than a
		threshold p0 specified by the statistician, in this package
		with the default value 0.01. This approximations approach is
		not only much simpler it is overwhelmingly better than the
		standard model based approach. The will be demonstrated using
		high dimensional regression and vector autoregression real data
		sets. The goal is to find valid approximations. The search
		function is f1st which is a greedy forward selection procedure
		which results in either just one or no approximations which may
		however not be valid. If the size is less than than a threshold
		with default value 21 then an all subset procedure is called
		which returns the best valid subset. A good default start is
		f1st(y,x,kmn=15) The best function for returning multiple
		approximations is f3st which repeatedly calls f1st. For more
		information see the papers: L. Davies and L. Duembgen,
		"Covariate Selection Based on a Model-free Approach to Linear
		Regression with Exact Probabilities",
