		Simple Translation Between Different Languages // Message
		translation is often managed with 'po' files and the 'gettext'
		programme, but sometimes another solution is needed. In
		contrast to 'po' files, a more flexible approach is used as in
		the Fluent https://projectfluent.org/ project with RMarkdown
		snippets. The key-value approach allows easier handling of the
		translated messages.
