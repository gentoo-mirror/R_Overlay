		Bayesian Trees for Conditional Mean and Variance // A model of
		the form Y = f(x) + s(x) Z is fit where functions f and s are
		modeled with ensembles of trees and Z is standard normal. This
		model is developed in the paper 'Heteroscedastic BART Via
		Multiplicative Regression Trees' (Pratola, Chipman, George, and
		McCulloch, 2019, arXiv:1709.07542v2). BART refers to Bayesian
		Additive Regression Trees. See the R-package 'BART'. The
		predictor vector x may be high dimensional. A Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm provides Bayesian posterior
		uncertainty for both f and s. The MCMC uses the recent
		innovations in Efficient Metropolis--Hastings proposal
		mechanisms for Bayesian regression tree models (Pratola, 2015,
		Bayesian Analysis, doi:10.1214/16-BA999).
