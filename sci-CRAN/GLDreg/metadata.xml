		Fit GLD Regression/Quantile/AFT Model to Data // Owing to the
		rich shapes of Generalised Lambda Distributions (GLDs), GLD
		standard/quantile/Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) regression is
		a competitive flexible model compared to standard/quantile/AFT
		regression. The proposed method has some major advantages: 1)
		it provides a reference line which is very robust to outliers
		with the attractive property of zero mean residuals and 2) it
		gives a unified, elegant quantile regression model from the
		reference line with smooth regression coefficients across
		different quantiles. For AFT model, it also eliminates the
		needs to try several different AFT models, owing to the
		flexible shapes of GLD. The goodness of fit of  the proposed
		model can be assessed via QQ plots and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
		and data driven smooth test, to ensure the appropriateness of
		the statistical inference under consideration. Statistical
		distributions of coefficients of the GLD regression line are
		obtained using simulation, and interval estimates are obtained
		directly from simulated data.  References include the
