		Radial Velocity Method for Detecting Exoplanets // Has various
		functions designed to implement the Hermite-Gaussian Radial
		Velocity (HGRV) estimation approach of Holzer et al. (2020)
		arXiv:2005.14083, which is a particular application of the
		radial velocity method for detecting exoplanets. The overall
		approach consists of four sequential steps, each of which has a
		function in this package: (1) estimate the template spectrum
		with the function estimate_template(), (2) find absorption
		features in the estimated template with the function
		findabsorptionfeatures(), (3) fit Gaussians to the absorption
		features with the function Gaussfit(), (4) apply the HGRV with
		simple linear regression by calling the function hgrv(). This
		package is meant to be open source. But please cite the paper
		Holzer et al. (2020) arXiv:2005.14083 when publishing results
		that use this package.
