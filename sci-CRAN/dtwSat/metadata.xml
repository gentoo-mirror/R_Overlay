		Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for Satellite Image Time
		Series Analysis // Provides an implementation of the Time-
		Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) method for land cover
		mapping using satellite image time series. TWDTW is based on
		the Dynamic Time Warping technique and has achieved high
		accuracy for land cover classification using satellite data.
		The method is based on comparing unclassified satellite image
		time series with a set of known temporal patterns (e.g.
		phenological cycles associated with the vegetation). Using
		'dtwSat' the user can build temporal patterns for land cover
		types, apply the TWDTW analysis for satellite datasets,
		visualize the results of the time series analysis, produce land
		cover maps, create temporal plots for land cover change, and
		compute accuracy assessment metrics.
