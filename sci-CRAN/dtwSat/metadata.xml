		Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for Satellite Image Time
		Series Analysis // Provides a robust approach to land use
		mapping using multi-dimensional (multi-band) satellite image
		time series. By leveraging the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
		Warping (TWDTW) distance metric in tandem with a 1 Nearest-
		Neighbor (1-NN) Classifier, this package offers functions to
		produce land use maps based on distinct seasonality patterns,
		commonly observed in the phenological cycles of vegetation. The
		approach is described in Maus et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2517118 and Maus et al. (2019)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v088.i05. A primary advantage of TWDTW is its
		capability to handle irregularly sampled and noisy time series,
		while also requiring minimal training sets. The package
		includes tools for training the 1-NN-TWDTW model, visualizing
		temporal patterns, producing land use maps, and visualizing the
		results.
