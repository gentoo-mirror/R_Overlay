		Multimodal Automated Phenotyping // Electronic health records
		(EHR) linked with biorepositories are a powerful platform for
		translational studies. A major bottleneck exists in the ability
		to phenotype patients accurately and efficiently. Towards that
		end, we developed an automated high-throughput phenotyping
		method integrating International Classification of Diseases
		(ICD) codes and narrative data extracted using natural language
		processing (NLP). Specifically, our proposed method, called MAP
		(Map Automated Phenotyping algorithm), fits an ensemble of
		latent mixture models on aggregated ICD and NLP counts along
		with healthcare utilization. The MAP algorithm yields a
		predicted probability of phenotype for each patient and a
		threshold for classifying subjects with phenotype yes/no (See
		Katherine P. Liao, et al. (2019) doi:10.1101/587436.).
