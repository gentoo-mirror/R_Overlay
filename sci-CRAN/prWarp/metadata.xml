		Warping Landmark Configurations // Compute bending energies,
		principal warps, partial warp scores, and the non-affine
		component of shape variation for 2D landmark configurations, as
		well as Mardia-Dryden distributions and self-similar
		distributions of landmarks, as described in Mitteroecker et al.
		(2020) doi:10.1093/sysbio/syaa007. Working examples to
		decompose shape variation into small-scale and large-scale
		components, and to decompose the total shape variation into
		outline and residual shape components are provided. Two
		landmark datasets are provided, that quantify skull morphology
		in humans and papionin primates, respectively from Mitteroecker
		et al. (2020) doi:10.5061/dryad.j6q573n8s and Grunstra et al.
