		Statistical Patterns in Genomic Sequences // A collection of
		statistical hypothesis tests and other techniques for
		identifying certain spatial relationships/phenomena in DNA
		sequences. In particular, it provides tests and graphical
		methods for determining whether or not DNA sequences comply
		with Chargaff's second parity rule or exhibit purine-pyrimidine
		parity. In addition, there are functions for efficiently
		simulating discrete state space Markov chains and testing
		arbitrary symbolic sequences of symbols for the presence of
		first-order Markovianness. Also, it has functions for counting
		words/k-mers (and cylinder patterns) in arbitrary symbolic
		sequences. Functions which take a DNA sequence as input can
		handle sequences stored as SeqFastadna objects from the
		'seqinr' package.
