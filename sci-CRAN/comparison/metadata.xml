		Multivariate Likelihood Ratio Calculation and Evaluation //
		Functions for calculating and evaluating likelihood ratios from
		uni/multivariate continuous observations. The package includes
		the two-level functions to calculate the LR assuming
		multivariate normality, and another with drops this assumption
		and uses a multivariate kernel density estimate. The package
		also contains code to perform empirical cross entropy (ECE)
		calibration of likelihood ratios. The LR functions are based
		primarily on Aitken, C.G.G. and Lucy, D. (2004)
		doi:10.1046/j.0035-9254.2003.05271.x, "Evaluation of trace
		evidence in the form of multivariate data," Journal of the
		Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), 53:
		109-122. The ECE functions are based primarily on  D. Ramos and
		J. Gonzalez-Rodrigues, (2008) "Cross-entropy analysis of the
		information in forensic speaker recognition," in Proc. IEEE
		Odyssey, Speaker Lang. Recognit. Workshop.
