		Some EM-Type Estimation Methods for the Heckman Selection Model
		// Some EM-type algorithms to estimate parameters for the well-
		known Heckman selection model are provided in the package. Such
		algorithms are as follow: ECM(Expectation/Conditional
		Maximization), ECM(NR)(the Newton-Raphson method is adapted to
		the ECM) and ECME(Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either).
		Since the algorithms are based on the EM algorithm, they also
		have EM's main advantages, namely, stability and ease of
		implementation. Further details and explanations of the
		algorithms can be found in Zhao et al. (2020) doi:
		10.1016/j.csda.2020.106930.
