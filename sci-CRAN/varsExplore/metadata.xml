		Searchable Variable Explorer with Labelled Variables // Creates a
		summary dataframe that can be used in 'RStudio' similar to the
		variable explorer in 'Stata', but which also includes the
		summary statistics. By default the result is shown in the
		'RStudio' Viewer Pane as a searchable data table. This is
		useful particularly if you have a large dataset with a very
		large number of labelled variables with hard to remember names.
		Can also be used to generate a table of summary statistics.
