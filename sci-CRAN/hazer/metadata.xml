		Identifying Foggy and Cloudy Images by Quantifying Haziness //
		Provides a set of functions to estimate haziness of an image
		based on RGB bands. It returns a haze factor, varying from 0 to
		1, a metric for fogginess and cloudiness. The package also
		presents additional functions to estimate brightness, darkness
		and contrast rasters of the RGB image. This package can be used
		for several applications such as inference of weather quality
		data and performing environmental studies from interpreting
		digital images.
