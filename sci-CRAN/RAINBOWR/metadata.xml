		Genome-Wide Association Study with SNP-Set Methods // By using
		'RAINBOWR' (Reliable Association INference By Optimizing
		Weights with R), users can test multiple SNPs (Single
		Nucleotide Polymorphisms) simultaneously by kernel-based (SNP-
		set) methods. This package can also be applied to haplotype-
		based GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study). Users can test not
		only additive effects but also dominance and epistatic effects.
		In detail, please check our preprint on bioRxiv: Kosuke
		Hamazaki and Hiroyoshi Iwata (2019) doi:10.1101/612028.
