		Transforming Behavioral Observation Records into Data Matrices //
		Transforms focal observations' data, where different types of
		social interactions can be recorded by multiple observers, into
		asymmetric data matrices. Each cell in these matrices provides
		counts on the number of times a specific type of social
		interaction was initiated by the row subject and directed to
		the column subject.
