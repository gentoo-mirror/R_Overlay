		'BLAS' and 'LAPACK' Routines for Native R Matrices and
		'big.matrix' Objects // Provides arithmetic functions for R
		matrix and 'big.matrix' objects as well as functions for QR
		factorization, Cholesky factorization, General eigenvalue, and
		Singular value decomposition (SVD). A method matrix
		multiplication and an arithmetic method -for matrix addition,
		matrix difference- allows for mixed type operation -a matrix
		class object and a big.matrix class object- and pure type
		operation for two big.matrix class objects.
