		serialize information stored in the Resource Description
		Framework (RDF). RDF is described at http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-
		primer. This package supports RDF by implementing an R

		http://librdf.org/docs/api/index.html. In brief, RDF provides a
		structured graph consisting of Statements composed of Subject,
		Predicate, and Object Nodes.
