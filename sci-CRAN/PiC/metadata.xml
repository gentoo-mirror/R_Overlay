		Pointcloud Interactive Computation for Forest Structure Analysis
		// Provides advanced algorithms for analyzing pointcloud data
		in forestry applications. Key features include fast
		voxelization of large datasets; segmentation of point clouds
		into forest floor, understorey, canopy, and wood components.
		The package enables efficient processing of large-scale forest
		pointcloud data, offering insights into forest structure,
		connectivity, and fire risk assessment. Algorithms to analyze
		pointcloud data (.xyz input file). For more details, see
