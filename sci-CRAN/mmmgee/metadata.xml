		Simultaneous Inference for Multiple Linear Contrasts in GEE
		Models // Provides global hypothesis tests, multiple testing
		procedures and simultaneous confidence intervals for multiple
		linear contrasts of regression coefficients in a single
		generalized estimating equation (GEE) model or across multiple
		GEE models. GEE models are fit by a modified version of the
		'geeM' package.
