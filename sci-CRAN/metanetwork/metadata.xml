		Handling and Representing Trophic Networks in Space and Time // A
		toolbox to handle and represent trophic networks in space or
		time across aggregation levels. This package contains a layout
		algorithm specifically designed for trophic networks, using
		dimension reduction on a diffusion graph kernel and trophic
		levels. Importantly, this package provides a layout method
		applicable for large trophic networks.
