		Stochastic Profiling using Maximum Likelihood Estimation // New
		Version of the R package originally accompanying the paper
		"Parameterizing cell-to-cell regulatory heterogeneities via
		stochastic transcriptional profiles" by Sameer S Bajikar,
		Christiane Fuchs, Andreas Roller, Fabian J Theis and Kevin A
		Janes (PNAS 2014, 111(5), E626-635
		doi:10.1073/pnas.1311647111). In this paper, we measure
		expression profiles from small heterogeneous populations of
		cells, where each cell is assumed to be from a mixture of
		lognormal distributions. We perform maximum likelihood
		estimation in order to infer the mixture ratio and the
		parameters of these lognormal distributions from the cumulated
		expression measurements. The main difference of this new
		package version to the previous one is that it is now possible
		to use different n's, i.e. a dataset where each tissue sample
		originates from a different number of cells. We used this on
		pheno-seq data, see: Tirier, S.M., Park, J., Preusser, F. et
		al. Pheno-seq - linking visual features and gene expression in
		3D cell culture systems. Sci Rep 9, 12367 (2019)
		doi:10.1038/s41598-019-48771-4).
