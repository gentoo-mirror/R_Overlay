		Landmark Multi-Dimensional Scaling // A fast dimensionality
		reduction method scaleable to large numbers of samples.
		Landmark Multi-Dimensional Scaling (LMDS) is an extension of
		classical Torgerson MDS, but rather than calculating a complete
		distance matrix between all pairs of samples, only the
		distances between a set of landmarks and the samples are
		calculated.
