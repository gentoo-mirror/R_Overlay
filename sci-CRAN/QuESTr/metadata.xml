		Constructing Quantitative Environment Sensor using Transcriptomes
		// A method for prediction of environmental conditions based on
		transcriptome data linked with the environmental gradients.
		This package provides functions to overview gene-environment
		relationships, to construct the prediction model, and to
		predict environmental conditions where the transcriptomes were
		generated. This package can quest for candidate genes for the
		model construction even in non-model organisms' transcriptomes
		without any genetic information.
