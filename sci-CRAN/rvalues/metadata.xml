		R-values for Ranking in High-Dimensional Settings // A collection
		of functions for computing "r-values" from various kinds of
		user input such as MCMC output or a list of effect size
		estimates and associated standard errors. Given a large
		collection of measurement units, the r-value, r, of a
		particular unit is a reported percentile that may be
		interpreted as the smallest percentile at which the unit should
		be placed in the top r-fraction of units.
