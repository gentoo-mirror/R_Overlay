		Pipeline for Debiased Target Trial Emulation // Supports
		propensity score-based methodsincluding matching,
		stratification, and weightingfor estimating causal treatment
		effects. It also implements calibration using negative control
		outcomes to enhance robustness. 'debiasedTrialEmulation'
		facilitates effect estimation for both binary and time-to-event
		outcomes, supporting risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), and
		hazard ratio (HR) as effect measures. It integrates statistical
		modeling and visualization tools to assess covariate balance,
		equipoise, and bias calibration. Additional methodsincluding
		approaches to address immortal time bias, information bias,
		selection bias, and informative censoringare under development.
		Users interested in these extended features are encouraged to
		contact the package authors.
