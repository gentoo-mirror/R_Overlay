		Zoning Methods for Spatial Data // A zoning method and a
		numerical criterion for zoning quality are available in this
		package. The zoning method is based on a numerical criterion
		that evaluates the zoning quality. This criterion quantifies
		simultaneously how zones are heterogeneous on the whole map and
		how neighbouring zones are similar. This approach allows
		comparison between maps either with different zones or
		different labels, which is of importance for zone delineation
		algorithms aiming at maximizing inter-zone variability. An
		optimisation procedure provides the user with the best zonings
		thanks to contour delineation for a given map.
