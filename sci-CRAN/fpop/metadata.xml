		Segmentation using Optimal Partitioning and Function Pruning // A
		dynamic programming algorithm for the fast segmentation of
		univariate signals into piecewise constant profiles. The 'fpop'
		package is a wrapper to a C++ implementation of the fpop
		(Functional Pruning Optimal Partioning) algorithm described in
		Maidstone et al. 2017 doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9636-3. The
		problem of detecting changepoints in an univariate sequence is
		formulated in terms of minimising the mean squared error over
		segmentations. The fpop algorithm exactly minimizes the mean
		squared error for a penalty linear in the number of
		changepoints.
