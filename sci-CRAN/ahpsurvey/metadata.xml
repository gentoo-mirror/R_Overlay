		Analytic Hierarchy Process for Survey Data // The Analytic
		Hierarchy Process is a versatile multi-criteria decision-making
		tool introduced by Saaty (1987)
		doi:10.1016/0270-0255(87)90473-8 that allows decision-makers to
		weigh attributes and evaluate alternatives presented to them.
		This package provides a consistent methodology for researchers
		to reformat data and run analytic hierarchy process in R on
		data that are formatted using the survey data entry mode. It is
		optimized for performing the analytic hierarchy process with
		many decision-makers, and provides tools and options for
		researchers to aggregate individual preferences and test
		multiple options. It also allows researchers to quantify,
		visualize and correct for inconsistency in the decision-maker's
		comparisons.
