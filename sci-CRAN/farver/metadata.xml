		High Performance Colour Space Manipulation // The encoding of
		colour can be handled in many different ways, using different
		colour spaces. As different colour spaces have different uses,
		efficient conversion between these representations are
		important. The 'farver' package provides a set of functions
		that gives access to very fast colour space conversion and
		comparisons implemented in C++, and offers speed improvements
		over the 'convertColor' function in the 'grDevices' package.
