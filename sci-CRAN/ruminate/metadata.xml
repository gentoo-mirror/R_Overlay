		A Pharmacometrics Data Transformation and Analysis Tool //
		Exploration of pharmacometrics data involves both general tools
		(transformation and plotting) and specific techniques (non-
		compartmental analysis). This kind of exploration is generally
		accomplished by utilizing different packages. The purpose of
		'ruminate' is to create a 'shiny' interface to make these tools
		more broadly available while creating reproducible results.
