		Structural Additive Cumulative Intensity Models with IV // An
		instrumental variable estimator under structural cumulative
		additive intensity model is fitted, that leverages initial
		randomization as the IV. The estimator can be used to fit an
		additive hazards model under time to event data which handles
		treatment switching (treatment crossover) correctly. We also
		provide a consistent variance estimate.
