		Efficient Bayesian Models for Binary and Categorical Data //
		Highly efficient Bayesian implementations of probit, logit,
		multinomial logit and binomial logit models. Functions for
		plotting and tabulating the estimation output are available as
		well. Estimation is based on Gibbs sampling where the Markov
		chain Monte Carlo algorithms are based on the latent variable
		representations and boosting algorithms outlined in Frhwirth-
		Schnatter S., Zens G., Wagner H. (2020) arXiv:2011.06898. The
		underlying implementation is written in C++.
