		Compares Random Distributions using Stochastic Dominance // The
		Stochastic Dominance (SD) is the classical way of comparing two
		random prospects, using their distribution functions. Almost
		Stochastic Dominance (ASD) has also been developed to cover the
		SD failures due to the extreme utility functions. This package
		focuses on classical and heuristic methods for testing the
		first and second SD and ASD methods given the probability mass
		function (PMF) of the random prospects. The goal is to apply
		these methods easily, efficiently, and effectively on real-
		world datasets. For more details see Hanoch and Levy (1969)
