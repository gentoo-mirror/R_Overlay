		Filtering, Visualization and Analysis of Eye Tracking Data //
		Functions for analysing eye tracking data, including event
		detection (I-VT, I-DT and two means clustering), visualizations
		and area of interest (AOI) based analyses. See separate
		documentation for each function. The principles underlying I-VT
		and I-DT filters are described in Salvucci  Goldberg
		(2000,\doi{10.1145/355017.355028}). Two-means clustering is
		described in Hessels et al. (2017,
		\doi{10.3758/s13428-016-0822-1}).
