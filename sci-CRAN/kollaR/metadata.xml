		Event Classification, Visualization and Analysis of Eye Tracking
		Data // Functions for analysing eye tracking data, including
		event detection, visualizations and area of interest (AOI)
		based analyses. The package includes implementations of the
		IV-T, I-DT, adaptive velocity threshold, and Identification by
		two means clustering (I2MC) algorithms. See separate
		documentation for each function. The principles underlying I-VT
		and I-DT algorithms are described in   Salvucci  Goldberg
		(2000,\doi{10.1145/355017.355028}). Two-means clustering is
		described in Hessels et al. (2017,
		\doi{10.3758/s13428-016-0822-1}). The adaptive velocity
		threshold algorithm is described in Nystrm  Holmqvist
		(2010,\doi{10.3758/BRM.42.1.188}). See a demonstration in the
		URL.
