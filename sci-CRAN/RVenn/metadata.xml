		Set Operations for Many Sets // Set operations for many sets. The
		base functions for set operations in R can be used for only two
		sets. This package uses 'purr' to find the union, intersection
		and difference of three or more sets. This package also
		provides functions for pairwise set operations among several
		sets. Further, based on 'ggplot2' and 'ggforce', a Venn diagram
		can be drawn for two or three sets. For bigger data sets, a
		clustered heatmap showing presence/absence of the elements of
		the sets can be drawn based on the 'pheatmap' package. Finally,
		enrichment test can be applied to two sets whether an overlap
		is statistically significant or not.
