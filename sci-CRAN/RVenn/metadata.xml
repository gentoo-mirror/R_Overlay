		Set Operations for Many Sets // Set operations for many sets. The
		base functions for set operations in R are good for only two
		sets. This package uses 'purrr' to find the union, intersection
		and difference of three or more sets. Further, based on
		'ggplot2' and 'ggforce', Venn diagram can be drawn for two or
		three sets (Venn diagrams with four or more sets are terrible,
		please use 'UpSet' if you have lots of sets). Finally,
		enrichment test can be applied to two sets whether an overlap
		is statistically significant or not.
