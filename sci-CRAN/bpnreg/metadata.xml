		Bayesian Projected Normal Regression Models for Circular Data //
		Fitting Bayesian multiple and mixed-effect regression models
		for circular data based on the projected normal distribution.
		Both continuous and categorical predictors can be included.
		Sampling from the posterior is performed via an MCMC algorithm.
		Posterior descriptives of all parameters, model fit statistics
		and Bayes factors for hypothesis tests for inequality
		constrained hypotheses are provided. See Cremers, Mulder
