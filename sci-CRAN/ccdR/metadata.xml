		chemical, hazard, and bioactivity data from the Center for
		Computational Toxicology and Exposure ('CCTE') APIs
		https://api-ccte.epa.gov/docs/. 'ccdR' was developed to
		streamline the process of accessing the information available
		through the 'CCTE' APIs without requiring prior knowledge of
		how to use APIs. All data is also available on the CompTox
		Chemical Dashboard ('CCD') https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/.
