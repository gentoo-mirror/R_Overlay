		Generalized Linear Regression Models on Network-Linked Data with
		Statistical Inference // Linear regression model and
		generalized linear models with nonparametric network effects on
		network-linked observations. The model is originally proposed
		by Le and Li (2022) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2007.00803 and is
		assumed on observations that are connected by a network or
		similar relational data structure. A more recent work by Wang,
		Le and Li (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2410.01163 further extends
		the framework to generalized linear models. All these models
		are implemented in the current package. The model does not
		assume that the relational data or network structure to be
		precisely observed; thus, the method is provably robust to a
		certain level of perturbation of the network structure. The
		package contains the estimation and inference function for the
		model.
