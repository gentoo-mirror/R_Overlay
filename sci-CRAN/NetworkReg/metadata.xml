		Regression Model on Network-Linked Data with Statistical
		Inference // Linear regression model with nonparametric network
		effects on network-linked observations. The model is proposed
		by Le and Li (2022) arXiv:2007.00803 and is assumed on
		observations that are connected by a network or similar
		relational data structure. The model does not assume that the
		relational data or network structure to be precisely observed;
		thus, the method is provably robust to a certain level of
		perturbation of the network structure. The package contains the
		estimation and inference function for the model.
