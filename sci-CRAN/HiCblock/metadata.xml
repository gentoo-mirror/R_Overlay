		Systematic Analysis of Architectural Proteins and Functional
		Elements in Blocking Long-Range Contacts Between Loci // Here
		we propose a model to systematically analyze the roles of
		architectural proteins and functional elements in blocking
		long-range contacts between loci. The proposed model does not
		rely on topologically associating domain (TAD) mapping from
		Hi-C data. Instead of testing the enrichment or influence of
		protein binding at TAD borders, the model directly estimates
		the blocking effect of proteins on long-range contacts between
		flanking loci, making the model intuitive and biologically
		meaningful.
