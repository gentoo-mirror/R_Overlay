		Bivariate Automatic Analysis // Simplify bivariate and regression
		analyses by automating result generation, including summary
		tables, statistical tests, and customizable graphs. It supports
		tests for continuous and dichotomous data, as well as stepwise
		regression for linear, logistic, and Firth penalized logistic
		models.  While not a substitute for tailored analysis,
		'BiVariAn' accelerates workflows and is expanding features like
		multilingual interpretations of results.The methods for
		selecting significant statistical tests, as well as the
		predictor selection in prediction functions, can be referenced
		in the works of Marc Kery (2003)
