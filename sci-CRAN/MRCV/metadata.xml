		Methods for Analyzing Multiple Response Categorical Variables
		(MRCVs) // Provides functions for analyzing the association
		between one single response categorical variable (SRCV) and one
		multiple response categorical variable (MRCV), or between two
		or three MRCVs.  A modified Pearson chi-square statistic can be
		used to test for marginal independence for the one or two MRCV
		case, or a more general loglinear modeling approach can be used
		to examine various other structures of association for the two
		or three MRCV case.  Bootstrap- and asymptotic-based
		standardized residuals and model-predicted odds ratios are
		available, in addition to other descriptive information.
		Statisical methods implemented are described in Bilder et al.
