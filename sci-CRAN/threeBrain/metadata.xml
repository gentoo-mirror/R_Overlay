		3D Brain Visualization // A fast, interactive cross-platform, and
		easy to share 'WebGL'-based 3D brain viewer that visualizes
		'FreeSurfer' and/or 'AFNI/SUMA' surfaces. The viewer widget can
		be either standalone or embedded into 'R-shiny' applications.
		The standalone version only require a web browser with 'WebGL2'
		support (for example, 'Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Safari'), and can
		be inserted into any websites. The 'R-shiny' support allows the
		3D viewer to be dynamically generated from reactive user
		inputs. This feature has been fully adopted by 'RAVE'
		https://openwetware.org/wiki/RAVE, an interactive toolbox to
		analyze 'iEEG' data. Documentation about 'threeBrain' is
		provided by https://dipterix.org/threeBrain/ and several
		vignettes included in this package. To cite the package, please
		check our 'NeuroImage' paper by Magnotti, Wang, and Beauchamp
		(2020, doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117341), or see
		'citation("threeBrain")' for details.
