		3D Brain Visualization // In neuroscience, 'AFNI/SUMA' is a great
		tool to visualize 3D brain. However, it takes efforts to
		interact and share the viewer to others. In addition,
		'AFNI/SUMA' doesn't support Windows platform. In the 'EEG/iEEG'
		field, it's hard to have multiple cortical electrodes mapped to
		a template brain for group analysis. Therefore this package is
		written aimed at providing a fast, stable, interactive and easy
		to share tool based on 'Three.js', a 'WebGL' engine to render
		3D objects in the web browser such that we can display brain
		surfaces on webpage interactively. This package translates R
		objects to JavaScript objects via 'JSON' format, and provides
		'R-Shiny' interface to manipulate geometries interactively. The
		visualizations can also serve as standalone widgets that can be
		easily shared across different platforms. Along with 'rave',
		another package developed by Beauchamp's lab at Baylor College
		Medicine, this package provides solutions to easily map surface
		electrodes from multiple subjects to one template 141 brain.
