		Basic Sentiment Analysis Scorer // A popular technique in text
		analysis today is sentiment analysis, or trying to determine
		the overall emotional attitude of a piece of text (positive or
		negative).  We provide a new, basic implementation of a common
		method for computing sentiment, whereby words are scored as
		positive or negative according to a "dictionary", and then an
		average of those scores for the document is produced.  The
		package uses the 'Hu' and 'Liu' sentiment dictionary for
		assigning sentiment.
