		Sentiment Analysis Scorer // Sentiment analysis is a popular
		technique in text mining that attempts to determine the
		emotional state of some text. We provide a new implementation
		of a common method for computing sentiment, whereby words are
		scored as positive or negative according to a dictionary
		lookup. Then the sum of those scores is returned for the
		document. We use the 'Hu' and 'Liu' sentiment dictionary ('Hu'
		and 'Liu', 2004) doi:10.1145/1014052.1014073 for determining
		sentiment. The scoring function is 'vectorized' by document,
		and scores for multiple documents are computed in parallel via
		'OpenMP'.
