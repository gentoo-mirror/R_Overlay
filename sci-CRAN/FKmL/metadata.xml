		Frchet Distance-Based K-Means and Extensions for Longitudinal
		Data // Implements shape-based clustering algorithms for
		multidimensional longitudinal data based on the Frchet
		distance. It implements two main methods: MFKmL
		(Multidimensional Frchet distance-based K-means for
		Longitudinal data), an extension of the K-means algorithm using
		the Frchet distance originally developed in the 'kmlShape'
		package, adapted for multidimensional trajectories; and SFKmL
		(Sparse multidimensional Frchet distance-based K-medoids for
		Longitudinal data), a K-medoids-based clustering algorithm that
		incorporates variable selection. These tools are designed to
		enhance clustering performance in high-dimensional longitudinal
		data settings, particularly those with time delays, variations
		in trajectory speed, irregular sampling intervals, and noise.
		This package implements methods derived from Kang et al. (2023)
