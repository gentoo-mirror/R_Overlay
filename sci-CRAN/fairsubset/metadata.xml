		Choose Representative Subsets // Allows user to obtain subsets of
		columns of data or vectors within a list.  These subsets will
		match the original data in terms of average and variation, but
		have a consistent length of data per column.  It is intended
		for use on automated data generation which may not always
		output the same N per replicate or sample.
