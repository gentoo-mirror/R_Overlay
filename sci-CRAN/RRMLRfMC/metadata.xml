		Reduced-Rank Multinomial Logistic Regression for Markov Chains //
		Fit the reduced-rank multinomial logistic regression model for
		Markov chains developed by Wang, Abner, Fardo, Schmitt, Jicha,
		Eldik and Kryscio (2021)doi:10.1002/sim.8923 in R. It combines
		the ideas of multinomial logistic regression in Markov chains
		and reduced-rank. It is very useful in a study where multi-
		states model is assumed and each transition among the states is
		controlled by a series of covariates. The key advantage is to
		reduce the number of parameters to be estimated. The final
		coefficients for all the covariates and the p-values for the
		interested covariates will be reported. The p-values for the
		whole coefficient matrix can be calculated by two bootstrap
		methods.
