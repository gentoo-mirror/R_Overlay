		Permutation Tests for General Dependent Truncation //
		Implementations of permutation approach to hypothesis testing
		for quasi-independence of truncation time and failure time. The
		implemented approaches are powerful against non-monotone
		alternatives and thereby offer protection against erroneous
		assumptions of quasi-independence. The proposed tests use
		either a conditional or an unconditional method to evaluate the
		permutation p-value. The conditional method was first developed
		in Tsai (1980) doi:10.2307/2336059 and Efron and Petrosian
		(1992) doi:10.1086/171931. The unconditional method provides a
		valid approximation to the conditional method, yet
		computationally simpler and does not hold fixed the size of
		each risk sets. Users also have an option to carry out the
		proposed permutation tests in a parallel computing fashion.
