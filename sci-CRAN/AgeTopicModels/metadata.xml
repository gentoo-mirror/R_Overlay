		Inferring Age-Dependent Disease Topic from Diagnosis Data // We
		propose an age-dependent topic modelling (ATM) model, providing
		a low-rank representation of longitudinal records of hundreds
		of distinct diseases in large electronic health record data
		sets. The model assigns to each individual topic weights for
		several disease topics; each disease topic reflects a set of
		diseases that tend to co-occur as a function of age, quantified
		by age-dependent topic loadings for each disease. The model
		assumes that for each disease diagnosis, a topic is sampled
		based on the individuals topic weights (which sum to 1 across
		topics, for a given individual), and a disease is sampled based
		on the individuals age and the age-dependent topic loadings
		(which sum to 1 across diseases, for a given topic at a given
		age). The model generalises the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
		(LDA) model by allowing topic loadings for each topic to vary
		with age. References: Jiang (2023)
