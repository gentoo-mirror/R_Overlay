		Run Once and Save Result // Package 'runonce' helps automating
		the saving of long-running code to help running the same code
		multiple times. If you run some long-running code once, it
		saves the result in a file on disk. Then, if the result already
		exists, i.e. if the code has already been run and its output
		has already been saved, it just read the result from the stored
		file instead of running the code again.
