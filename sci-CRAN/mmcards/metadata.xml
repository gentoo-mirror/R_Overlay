		Playing Cards Utility Functions // Early insights in probability
		theory were largely influenced by questions about gambling and
		games of chance, as noted by Blitzstein and Hwang (2019,
		ISBN:978-1138369917). In modern times, playing cards continue
		to serve as an effective teaching tool for probability,
		statistics, and even 'R' programming, as demonstrated by
		Grolemund (2014, ISBN:978-1449359010). The 'mmcards' package
		offers a collection of utility functions designed to aid in the
		creation, manipulation, and utilization of playing card decks
		in multiple formats. These include a standard 52-card deck, as
		well as alternative decks such as decks defined by custom
		anonymous functions and custom interleaved decks. Optimized for
		the development of educational 'shiny' applications, the
		package is particularly useful for teaching statistics and
		probability through card-based games. Functions include
		shuffle_deck(), which creates either a shuffled standard deck
		or a shuffled custom alternative deck; deal_card(), which takes
		a deck and returns a list object containing both the dealt card
		and the updated deck; and i_deck(), which adds image paths to
		card objects, further enriching the package's utility in the
		development of interactive 'shiny' application card games.
