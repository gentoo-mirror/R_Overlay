		Reduce the Number of Holes in the School Timetable // If a
		teacher was assigned, say, hours 1, 2, 4, 6 for his lessons on
		the current day, then he got two "gaps" (or "holes"), in hours
		3 and 5. If the total number of holes in the existing daily
		schedule is too large (exceeding, say, 6% of the total
		lessons), then the problem arises of reallocating the
		respective lessons by hours (respecting the constraints induced
		by the existence of coupled lessons) so that the total number
		of holes is as small as possible.
