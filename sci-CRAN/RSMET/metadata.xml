		Get Real-Time Meteorological Data in SMET Format // It manages
		snow and weather local time series as provided by MeteoIO
		(http://models.slf.ch/docserver/meteoio/html/index.html,
		http:// www.slf.ch/ueber/organisation/schnee_permafrost/projekt
		e/MeteoIO/index_EN, https://www.openhub.net/p/MeteoIO). MeteoIO
		is a C/C++ Open Source library which has been designed to
		settle both the needs of carefully crafted simulations for a
		specific purpose/study and for the needs of operational
		simulations that run automatically and unattended". It is
		integrated in physical spatially-distributed models and tackles
		several issues with weather input/ output data. Here a SMET S4
		class object is defined and can be imported from/ exported to a
		SMET ini files of MeteoIO , allowing interoperability from R to
		MeteoIO and other SMET-compliant software.
