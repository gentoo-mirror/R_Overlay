		Das Gupta Standardisation and Decomposition // Implementation of
		Das Gupta's standardisation and decomposition of population
		rates, as set out "Standardization and decomposition of rates:
		A users manual", Das Gupta (1993) https://www2.census.gov/libra
		ry/publications/1993/demographics/p23-186.pdf. The goal of
		these methods is to calculate adjusted rates based on
		compositional 'factors' and quantify the contribution of each
		factor to the difference in crude rates between populations.
		The package offers functionality to handle various scenarios
		for any number of factors and populations, where said factors
		can be comprised of vectors across sub-populations (including
		cross-classified population breakdowns), and with the option to
		specify user-defined rate functions.
