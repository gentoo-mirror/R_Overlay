		Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood Estimate for Cohort Samplings
		// To compute the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimates
		(NPMLEs) and penalized NPMLEs with SCAD, HARD and LASSO
		penalties for nested case-control or case-cohort sampling
		design with time matching under Cox's regression model. It also
		proposes the standard error formula for estimator using
		observed profile likelihood. For details about (penalized)
		NPNLEs see the original paper "Penalized Full Likelihood
		Approach to Variable Selection for Cox's Regression Model under
		Nested Case-Control Sampling" by Wang et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1007/s10985-019-09475-z.
