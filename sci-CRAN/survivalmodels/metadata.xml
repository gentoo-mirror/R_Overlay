		Models for Survival Analysis // Implementations of classical and
		machine learning models for survival analysis, including deep
		neural networks via 'keras' and 'tensorflow'. Each model
		includes a separated fit and predict interface with consistent
		prediction types for predicting risk, survival probabilities,
		or survival distributions with 'distr6'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distr6. Models are either
		implemented from 'Python' via 'reticulate'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reticulate, from code in
		GitHub packages, or novel implementations using 'Rcpp'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp. Novel machine learning
		survival models wil be included in the package in near-future
		updates. Neural networks are implemented from the 'Python'
		package 'pycox' https://github.com/havakv/pycox and are
		detailed by Kvamme et al. (2019)
		https://jmlr.org/papers/v20/18-424.html. The 'Akritas'
		estimator is defined in Akritas (1994)
		doi:10.1214/aos/1176325630. 'DNNSurv' is defined in Zhao and
		Feng (2020) arXiv:1908.02337.
