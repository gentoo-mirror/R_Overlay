		Models for Survival Analysis // Implementations of classical and
		machine learning models for survival analysis, including deep
		neural networks via 'keras' and 'tensorflow'. Each model
		includes a separated fit and predict interface with consistent
		prediction types for predicting risk or survival probabilities.
		Models are either implemented from 'Python' via 'reticulate'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reticulate, from code in
		GitHub packages, or novel implementations using 'Rcpp'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp. Neural networks are
		implemented from the 'Python' package 'pycox'
		https://github.com/havakv/pycox.
