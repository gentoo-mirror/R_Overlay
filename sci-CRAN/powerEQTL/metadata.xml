		Power and Sample Size Calculation for Bulk Tissue and Single-Cell
		eQTL Analysis // Power and sample size calculation for bulk
		tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis based on ANOVA, simple
		linear regression, or linear mixed effects model. It can also
		calculate power/sample size for testing the association of a
		SNP to a continuous type phenotype. Please see the reference:
