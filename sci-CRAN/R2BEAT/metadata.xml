		Multistage Sampling Allocation and Sample Selection //
		Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one
		and two stages stratified sample design. R2BEAT extends the
		Neyman (1934)  Tschuprow (1923) allocation method to the case
		of several variables, adopting a generalization of the Bethels
		proposal (1989).R2BEAT develops this methodology but, moreover,
		it allows to determine the sample allocation in the
		multivariate and multi-domains case of estimates for two-stage
		stratified samples. It also allows to perform both Primary
		Stage Units and Secondary Stage Units selection. This package
		requires the availability of ReGenesees, that can be installed
		from https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees.
