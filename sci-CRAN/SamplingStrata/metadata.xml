		Optimal Stratification of Sampling Frames for Multipurpose
		Sampling Surveys // Tools for the optimization of stratified
		sampling design. It determines a stratification of a sampling
		frame that minimizes sample cost while satisfying precision
		constraints in a multivariate and multidomain context. The
		approach relies on a genetic algorithm; each candidate
		partition of the frame is an individual whose fitness is
		evaluated via the Bethel-Chromy allocation to meet target
		precisions. Functions support analysis of optimization results,
		labeling of the frame with new strata, and drawing a sample
		according to the optimal allocation. Algorithmic components
		adapt code from the 'genalg' package. See M. Ballin and G.
		Barcaroli (2020) "R package SamplingStrata: new developments
		and extension to Spatial Sampling"
