		Optimal Stratification of Sampling Frames for Multipurpose
		Sampling Surveys // In the field of stratified sampling design,
		this package offers an approach for the determination of the
		best stratification of a sampling frame, the one that ensures
		the minimum sample cost under the condition to satisfy
		precision constraints in a multivariate and multidomain case.
		This approach is based on the use of the genetic algorithm:
		each solution (i.e. a particular partition in strata of the
		sampling frame) is considered as an individual in a population;
		the fitness of all individuals is evaluated applying the
		Bethel-Chromy algorithm to calculate the sampling size
		satisfying precision constraints on the target estimates.
		Functions in the package allows to: (a) analyse the obtained
		results of the optimisation step; (b) assign the new strata
		labels to the sampling frame; (c) select a sample from the new
		frame accordingly to the best allocation. Functions for the
		execution of the genetic algorithm are a modified version of
		the functions in the 'genalg' package. M.Ballin, G.Barcaroli

		developments and extension to Spatial Sampling".
