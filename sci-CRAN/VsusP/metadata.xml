		Variable Selection using Shrinkage Priors // Bayesian variable
		selection using shrinkage priors to identify significant
		variables in high-dimensional datasets. The package includes
		methods for determining the number of significant variables
		through innovative clustering techniques of posterior
		distributions, specifically utilizing the 2-Means and
		Sequential 2-Means (S2M) approaches. The package aims to
		simplify the variable selection process with minimal tuning
		required in statistical analysis.
