		Analyzing Data Through of Percentage of Importance Indice and Its
		Derivations // The Percentage of Importance Indice
		(Percentage_I.I.) bases in magnitudes, frequencies, and
		distributions of occurrence of an event (DEMOLIN-LEITE, 2021) h
		ttp://scielo.sld.cu/pdf/cjas/v55n2/2079-3480-cjas-55-02-e10.pdf
		. This index can detect the key loss sources (L.S) and solution
		sources (S.S.), classifying them according to their importance
		in terms of loss or income gain, on the productive system. The
		Percentage_I.I. = [(ks1 x c1 x ds1)/SUM (ks1 x c1 x ds1) + (ks2
		x c2 x ds2) + (ksn x cn x dsn)] x 100. key source (ks) is
		obtained using simple regression analysis and magnitude
		(abundance). Constancy (c) is SUM of occurrence of L.S. or S.S.
		on the samples (absence = 0 or presence = 1), and distribution
		source (ds) is obtained using chi-square test. This index has
		derivations: i.e., i) Loss estimates and solutions
		effectiveness and ii) Attention and non-attention levels
