		Computer Experiment Designs // In computer experiments space-
		filling designs are having great impact. Most popularly used
		space-filling designs are Uniform designs (UDs), Latin
		hypercube designs (LHDs) etc. For further references one can
		see Mckay (1979) DOI:10.1080/00401706.1979.10489755 and Fang
		(1980) https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1570291225616774784. In this
		package, we have provided algorithms for generate efficient
		LHDs and UDs. Here, generated LHDs are efficient as they
		possess lower value of Maxpro measure, Phi_p value and Maximum
		Absolute Correlation (MAC) value based on the weightage given
		to each criterion. On the other hand, the produced UDs are
		having good space-filling property as they attained the lower
		bound of Discrete Discrepancy measure.
