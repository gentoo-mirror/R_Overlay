		Change-Point Detection by Sample-Splitting Methods // Implements
		multiple change searching algorithms for a variety of
		frequently considered parametric change-point models. In
		particular, it integrates a criterion proposed by Zou, Wang and
		Li (2020) doi:10.1214/19-AOS1814 to select the number of
		change-points in a data-driven fashion. Moreover, it also
		provides interfaces for user-customized change-point models
		with one's own cost function and parameter estimation routine.
		It is easy to get started with the cpss.* set of functions by
		accessing their documentation pages (e.g., ?cpss).
