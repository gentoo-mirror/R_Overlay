		Comprehensive Geospatiotemporal Analysis and Multimodal
		Integration Toolkit // A comprehensive toolkit for
		geospatiotemporal analysis featuring 60+ vegetation indices,
		advanced raster visualization, universal spatial mapping, water
		quality analysis, CDL crop analysis, spatial interpolation,
		temporal analysis, and terrain analysis. Designed for
		agricultural research, environmental monitoring, remote sensing
		applications, and publication-quality mapping with support for
		any geographic region and robust error handling. Methods
		include vegetation indices calculations (Rouse et al. 1974),
		NDVI and enhanced vegetation indices (Huete et al. 1997)
