		Propensity Score Weighting for Causal Inference with
		Observational Studies and Randomized Trials // Supports
		propensity score weighting analysis of observational studies
		and randomized trials. Enables the estimation and inference of
		average causal effects with binary and multiple treatments
		using overlap weights (ATO), inverse probability of treatment
		weights (ATE), average treatment effect among the treated
		weights (ATT), matching weights (ATM) and entropy weights
		(ATEN), with and without propensity score trimming. These
		weights are members of the family of balancing weights
		introduced in Li, Morgan and Zaslavsky (2018)
