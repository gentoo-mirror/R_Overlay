		Real-Time Disease Surveillance // Supports modelling real-time
		case data to facilitate the real-time surveillance of
		infectious diseases and other point phenomena. The package
		provides automated computational grid generation over an area
		of interest with methods to map covariates between geographies,
		model fitting including spatially aggregated case counts, and
		predictions and visualisation. Both Bayesian and maximum
		likelihood methods are provided. Log-Gaussian Cox Processes are
		described by Diggle et al. (2013) doi:10.1214/13-STS441 and we
		provide both the low-rank approximation for Gaussian processes
		described by Solin and Srkk (2020)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-019-09886-w and Riutort-Mayol et al (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-022-10167-2 and the nearest neighbour
		Gaussian process described by Datta et al (2016)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1044091. 'cmdstanr' can be downloaded
