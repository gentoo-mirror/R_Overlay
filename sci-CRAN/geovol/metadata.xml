		Geopolitical Volatility (GEOVOL) Modelling // Simulation,
		estimation and inference for the geopolitical volatility
		(GEOVOL) model of Engle and Campos-Martins (2020)
		doi:10.2139/ssrn.3685213, where GEOVOL is modelled as a latent
		multiplicative volatility factor with heterogeneous factor
		loadings. Estimation is carried out as a maximization-
		maximization procedure, where GEOVOL and the GEOVOL loadings
		are estimated iteratively until convergence.
