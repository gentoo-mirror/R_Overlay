		Geopolitical Volatility (GEOVOL) Modelling // Simulation,
		estimation and testing for geopolitical volatility (GEOVOL)
		based on the global common volatility model of Engle and
		Campos-Martins (2023) doi:10.1016/j.jfineco.2022.09.009. GEOVOL
		is modelled as a latent multiplicative volatility factor with
		heterogeneous factor loadings. Estimation is carried out as a
		maximization-maximization procedure, where GEOVOL and the
		GEOVOL loadings are estimated iteratively until convergence.
