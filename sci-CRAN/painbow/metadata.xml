		Use XKCD's "Painbow" Colormap in ggplot2 // XKCD described a
		supposedly "bad" colormap that it called a "Painbow" (see
		https://xkcd.com/2537/). But simple tests demonstrate that
		under some circumstances, the colormap can perform very well,
		and people can find information that is difficult to detect
		with the ggplot2 default and even supposedly "good" colormaps
		like viridis. This library let's you use the Painbow in your
		own ggplot graphs.
