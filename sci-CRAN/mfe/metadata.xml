		Meta-Feature Extractor // Extracts meta-features from datasets to
		support the design of recommendation systems based on Meta-
		Learning. The meta-features, also called characterization
		measures, are able to characterize the complexity of datasets
		and to provide estimates of algorithm performance. The package
		contains not only the standard characterization measures, but
		also more recent characterization measures. By making available
		a large set of meta-feature extraction functions, tasks like
		comprehensive data characterization, deep data exploration and
		large number of Meta-Learning based data analysis can be
		performed. These concepts are described in the paper: Fabio
		Pinto, Carlos Soares, and Joao Mendes-Moreira. Towards
		automatic generation of metafeatures. In Pacific-Asia
		Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD),
		pages 215 - 226, 2016, doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31753-3_18.
