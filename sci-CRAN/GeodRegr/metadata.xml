		Geodesic Regression // Provides a gradient descent algorithm to
		find a geodesic relationship between real-valued independent
		variables and a manifold-valued dependent variable (i.e.
		geodesic regression). Available manifolds are Euclidean space,
		the sphere, and Kendall's 2-dimensional shape space. Besides
		the standard least-squares loss, the least absolute deviations,
		Huber, and Tukey biweight loss functions can also be used to
		perform robust geodesic regression. Functions to help choose
		appropriate cutoff parameters to maintain high efficiency for
		the Huber and Tukey biweight estimators are included. The
		k-sphere is a k-dimensional manifold: we represent it as a
		sphere of radius 1 and center 0 embedded in (k+1)-dimensional
		space. Kendall's 2D shape space with K landmarks is of real
		dimension 2K-4; preshapes are represented as complex K-vectors
		with mean 0 and magnitude 1. Details are described in Shin,
		H.-Y. and Oh, H.-S. (2020) arXiv:2007.04518. Also see Fletcher,
		P. T. (2013) doi:10.1007/s11263-012-0591-y and Kim, H. J.,
