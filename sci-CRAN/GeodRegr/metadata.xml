		Geodesic Regression // Provides a gradient descent algorithm to
		find a geodesic relationship between real-valued independent
		variables and a manifold-valued dependent variable (i.e.
		geodesic regression). Available manifolds are Euclidean space,
		the sphere, hyperbolic space, and Kendall's 2-dimensional shape
		space. Besides the standard least-squares loss, the least
		absolute deviations, Huber, and Tukey biweight loss functions
		can also be used to perform robust geodesic regression.
		Functions to help choose appropriate cutoff parameters to
		maintain high efficiency for the Huber and Tukey biweight
		estimators are included, as are functions for generating random
		tangent vectors from the Riemannian normal distributions on the
		sphere and hyperbolic space. The n-sphere is a n-dimensional
		manifold: we represent it as a sphere of radius 1 and center 0
		embedded in (n+1)-dimensional space. Using the hyperboloid
		model of hyperbolic space, n-dimensional hyperbolic space is
		embedded in (n+1)-dimensional Minkowski space as the upper
		sheet of a hyperboloid of two sheets. Kendall's 2D shape space
		with K landmarks is of real dimension 2K-4; preshapes are
		represented as complex K-vectors with mean 0 and magnitude 1.
		Details are described in Shin, H.-Y. and Oh, H.-S. (2020)
		arXiv:2007.04518. Also see Fletcher, P. T. (2013)
