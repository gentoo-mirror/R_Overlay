		Bradley-Terry Model with Exponential Time Decayed Log-Likelihood
		and Adaptive Lasso // We utilize the Bradley-Terry Model to
		estimate the abilities of teams using paired comparison data.
		For dynamic approximation of current rankings, we employ the
		Exponential Decayed Log-likelihood function, and we also apply
		the Lasso penalty for variance reduction and grouping. The main
		algorithm applies the Augmented Lagrangian Method described by
		Masarotto and Varin (2012) doi:10.1214/12-AOAS581.
