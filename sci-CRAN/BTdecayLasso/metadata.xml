		Bradley-Terry Model with Exponential Time Decayed Log-Likelihood
		and Adaptive Lasso // We apply Bradley-Terry Model to estimate
		teams' ability in paired comparison data. Exponential Decayed
		Log-likelihood function is applied for dynamic approximation of
		current rankings and Lasso penalty is applied for variance
		reduction and grouping. The main algorithm applies the
		Augmented Lagrangian Method described by Masarotto and Varin
