		Tidy Anomaly Detection // The 'anomalize' package enables a
		"tidy" workflow for detecting anomalies in data. The main
		functions are time_decompose(), anomalize(), and
		time_recompose(). When combined, it's quite simple to decompose
		time series, detect anomalies, and create bands separating the
		"normal" data from the anomalous data at scale (i.e. for
		multiple time series). Time series decomposition is used to
		remove trend and seasonal components via the time_decompose()
		function and methods include seasonal decomposition of time
		series by Loess ("stl") and seasonal decomposition by piecewise
		medians ("twitter"). The anomalize() function implements two
		methods for anomaly detection of residuals including using an
		inner quartile range ("iqr") and generalized extreme
		studentized deviation ("gesd"). These methods are based on
		those used in the 'forecast' package and the Twitter
		'AnomalyDetection' package. Refer to the associated functions
		for specific references for these methods.
