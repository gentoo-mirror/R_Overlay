		Revealing Splicing Dynamics at Single-Cell Resolution //
		Alternative splicing represents an additional and
		underappreciated layer of complexity underlying gene expression
		profiles. Nevertheless, there remains hitherto a paucity of
		software to investigate splicing dynamics at single-cell
		resolution. 'MARVEL' quantifies percent spliced-in (PSI) values
		for the all exon-level splicing events. Additionally, 'MARVEL'
		performs differential splicing analysis to identify splicing
		events whose PSI distribution differ between groups of cells.
		Finally, 'MARVEL' models the PSI distribution for each event as
		a beta distribution and categorises each distribution into
		modalities (inspired by Song (2017)
