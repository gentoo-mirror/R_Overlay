		Revealing Splicing Dynamics at Single-Cell Resolution //
		Alternative splicing represents an additional and
		underappreciated layer of complexity underlying gene expression
		profiles. Nevertheless, there remains hitherto a paucity of
		software to investigate splicing dynamics at single-cell
		resolution. 'MARVEL' enables splicing analysis of single-cell
		RNA-sequencing data generated from plate- and droplet-based
		library preparation methods.
