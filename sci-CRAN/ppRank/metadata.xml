		Classification of Algorithms // Implements the Bi-objective
		Lexicographical Classification method and Performance
		Assessment Ratio at 10% metric for algorithm classification.
		Constructs matrices representing algorithm performance under
		multiple criteria, facilitating decision-making in algorithm
		selection and evaluation. Analyzes and compares algorithm
		performance based on various metrics to identify the most
		suitable algorithms for specific tasks. This package includes
		methods for algorithm classification and evaluation, with
		examples provided in the documentation. Carvalho (2019)
		presents a statistical evaluation of algorithmic computational
		experimentation with infeasible solutions
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1902.00101. Moreira and Carvalho (2023)
		analyze power in preprocessing methodologies for datasets with
		missing values doi:10.1080/03610918.2023.2234683.
