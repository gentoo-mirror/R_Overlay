		Flexible and Robust Agreement and Reliability Analyses //
		Reliability and agreement analyses often have limited software
		support. Therefore, this package was created to make agreement
		and reliability analyses easier for the average researcher. The
		functions within this package include simple tests of
		agreement, agreement analysis for nested and replicate data,
		and provide robust analyses of reliability. In addition, this
		package contains a set of functions to help when planning
		studies looking to assess measurement agreement. For robust
		analyses of agreement, limits of agreement through a bootstrap
		method can also be calculated.
