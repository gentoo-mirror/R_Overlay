		Discrete Nonlinear Filtering for Stochastic Volatility Models //
		Implements the discrete nonlinear filter (DNF) of Kitagawa
		(1987) doi:10.1080/01621459.1987.10478534 to a wide class of
		stochastic volatility (SV) models with return and volatility
		jumps following the work of Bgin and Boudreault (2021)
		doi:10.1080/10618600.2020.1840995 to obtain likelihood
		evaluations and maximum likelihood parameter estimates. Offers
		several built-in SV models and a flexible framework for users
		to create customized models by specifying drift and diffusion
		functions along with an arrival distribution for the return and
		volatility jumps. Allows for the estimation of factor models
		with stochastic volatility (e.g., heteroskedastic volatility
		CAPM) by incorporating expected return predictors. Also
		includes functions to compute filtering and prediction
		distribution estimates, to simulate data from built-in and
		custom SV models with jumps, and to forecast future returns and
		volatility values using Monte Carlo simulation from a given SV
		model.
