		Seed Germination Indices and Curve Fitting // Provides functions
		to compute various germination indices such as germinability,
		median germination time, mean germination time, mean
		germination rate, speed of germination, Timson's index,
		germination value, coefficient of uniformity of germination,
		uncertainty of germination process, synchrony of germination
		etc. from germination count data. Includes functions for
		fitting cumulative seed germination curves using four-parameter
		hill function and computation of associated parameters. See the
		vignette for more, including full list of citations for the
		methods implemented.
