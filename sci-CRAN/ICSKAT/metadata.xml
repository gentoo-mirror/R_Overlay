		Interval-Censored Sequence Kernel Association Test // Implements
		the Interval-Censored Sequence Kernel Association (ICSKAT) test
		for testing the association between interval-censored time-to-
		event outcomes and groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms
		(SNPs). Interval-censored time-to-event data occur when the
		event time is not known exactly but can be deduced to fall
		within a given interval. For example, some medical conditions
		like bone mineral density deficiency are generally only
		diagnosed at clinical visits. If a patient goes for clinical
		checkups yearly and is diagnosed at, say, age 30, then the
		onset of the deficiency is only known to fall between the date
		of their age 29 checkup and the date of the age 30 checkup.
		Interval-censored data include right- and left-censored data as
		special cases. This package also implements the interval-
		censored Burden test and the ICSKATO test, which is the optimal
		combination of the ICSKAT and Burden tests. Please see the
		vignette for a quickstart guide.
