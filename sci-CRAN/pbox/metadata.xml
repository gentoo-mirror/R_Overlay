		Exploring Multivariate Spaces with Probability Boxes // Advanced
		statistical library offering a method to encapsulate and query
		the probability space of a dataset effortlessly using
		Probability Boxes (p-boxes). Its distinctive feature lies in
		the ease with which users can navigate and analyze marginal,
		joint, and conditional probabilities while taking into account
		the underlying correlation structure inherent in the data using
		copula theory and models. A comprehensive explanation is
		available in the paper "pbox: Exploring Multivariate Spaces
		with Probability Boxes" to be published in the Journal of
		Statistical Software.
