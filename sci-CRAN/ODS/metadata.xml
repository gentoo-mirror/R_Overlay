		Statistical Methods for Outcome-Dependent Sampling Designs //
		Outcome-dependent sampling (ODS) schemes are cost-effective
		ways to enhance study efficiency. In ODS designs, one observes
		the exposure/covariates with a probability that depends on the
		outcome variable. Popular ODS designs include case-control for
		binary outcome, case-cohort for time-to-event outcome, and
		continuous outcome ODS design (Zhou et al. 2002) doi:
		10.1111/j.0006-341X.2002.00413.x. Because ODS data has biased
		sampling nature, standard statistical analysis such as linear
		regression will lead to biases estimates of the population
		parameters. This package implements four statistical methods
		related to ODS designs: (1) An empirical likelihood method
		analyzing the primary continuous outcome with respect to
		exposure variables in continuous ODS design (Zhou et al.,
		2002). (2) A partial linear model analyzing the primary outcome
		in continuous ODS design (Zhou, Qin and Longnecker, 2011) doi:
		10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01500.x. (3) Analyze a secondary
		outcome in continuous ODS design (Pan et al. 2018) doi:
		10.1002/sim.7672. (4) An estimated likelihood method analyzing
		a secondary outcome in case-cohort data (Pan et al. 2017) doi:
		10.1111/biom.12838.
