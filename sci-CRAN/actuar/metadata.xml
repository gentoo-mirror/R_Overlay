		Actuarial Functions and Heavy Tailed Distributions // Functions
		and data sets for actuarial science: modeling of loss
		distributions; risk theory and ruin theory; simulation of
		compound models, discrete mixtures and compound hierarchical
		models; credibility theory. Support for many additional
		probability distributions to model insurance loss size and
		frequency: 23 continuous heavy tailed distributions; the
		Poisson-inverse Gaussian discrete distribution; zero-truncated
		and zero-modified extensions of the standard discrete
		distributions. Support for phase-type distributions commonly
		used to compute ruin probabilities. Main reference:

		family of distributions: doi:10.18637/jss.v103.i06.
