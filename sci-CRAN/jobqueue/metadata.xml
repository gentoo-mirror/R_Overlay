		Run Interruptible Code Asynchronously // Takes an R expression
		and returns a Job object with a $stop() method which can be
		called to terminate the background job. Also provides timeouts
		and other mechanisms for automatically terminating a background
		job. The result of the expression is available synchronously
		via $result or asynchronously with callbacks or through the
		'promises' package framework.
