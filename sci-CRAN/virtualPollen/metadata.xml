		Simulating Pollen Curves from Virtual Taxa with Different Life
		and Niche Traits // Tools to generate virtual environmental
		drivers with a given temporal autocorrelation, and to simulate
		pollen curves at annual resolution over millennial time-scales
		based on these drivers and virtual taxa with different life
		traits and niche features. It also provides the means to
		simulate quasi-realistic pollen-data conditions by applying
		simulated accumulation rates and given depth intervals between
		consecutive samples.
