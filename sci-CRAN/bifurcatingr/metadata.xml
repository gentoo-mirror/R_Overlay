		Bifurcating Autoregressive Models // Estimation of bifurcating
		autoregressive models of any order, p, BAR(p) as well as
		several types of bias correction for the least squares
		estimators of the autoregressive parameters as described in
		Zhou and Basawa (2005) doi:10.1016/j.spl.2005.04.024 and
		Elbayoumi and Mostafa (2020) doi:10.1002/sta4.342. Currently,
		the bias correction methods supported include bootstrap
		(single, double and fast-double) bias correction and linear-
		bias-function-based bias correction. Functions for generating
		and plotting bifurcating autoregressive data from any BAR(p)
		model are also included.
