		Mixture Models: Parametric, Semiparametric, and Robust // Various
		functions are provided to estimate parametric mixture models
		(with Gaussian, t, Laplace, log-concave distributions, etc.)
		and non-parametric mixture models. The package performs
		hypothesis tests and addresses label switching issues in
		mixture models. The package also allows for parameter
		estimation in mixture of regressions, proportion-varying
		mixture of regressions, and robust mixture of regressions.
