		Spatial Statistic with Kriging // Implements different methods
		for spatial statistics, in particular focused in Kriging based
		models. We count with different implemented models, simple,
		ordinary and universal forms of Kriging, co-Kriging and
		regression Kriging models. Includes, multivariate sensitivity
		analysis under an approximation designed over reproducing
		kernel Hilbert spaces and computation of Sobol indexes under
		this framework.
