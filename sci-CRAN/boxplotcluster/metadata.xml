		Clustering Method Based on Boxplot Statistics // Following
		Arroyo-Mat-Roque (2006), the function calculates the distance
		between columns of the dataset using the generalized Minkowski
		metric as described by Ichino-Yaguchi (1994). The distance
		measure gives more weight to differences between quartiles than
		to differences between extremes, making it less sensitive to
		outliers. Further,the function calculates the silhouette width
		(Rousseeuw 1987) for different numbers of clusters and selects
		the number of clusters that maximizes the average silhouette
		width, unless a specific number of clusters is provided by the
		user. The approach implemented in this package is based on the
		following publications: Rousseeuw (1987)
		doi:10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7; Ichino-Yaguchi (1994)
		doi:10.1109/21.286391; Arroyo-Mat-Roque (2006)
		doi:10.1007/3-540-34416-0_7.
