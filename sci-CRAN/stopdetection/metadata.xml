		Stop Detection in Timestamped Trajectory Data using
		Spatiotemporal Clustering // Trajectory data formed by human or
		animal movement is often marked by periods of movement
		interspersed with periods of standing still. It is often of
		interest to researchers to separate geolocation trajectories of
		latitude/longitude points by clustering consecutive locations
		to produce a model of this behavior. This package implements
		the Stay Point detection algorithm originally described in Ye
		(2009) doi:10.1109/MDM.2009.11 that uses time and distance
		thresholds to characterize spatial regions as 'stops'. This
		package also implements the concept of merging described in
		Montoliu (2013) doi:10.1007/s11042-011-0982-z as stay point
		region estimation, which allows for clustering of temporally
		adjacent stops for which distance between the midpoints is less
		than the provided threshold. GPS-like data from various sources
		can be used, but the temporal thresholds must be considered
		with respect to the sampling interval, and the spatial
		thresholds must be considered with respect to the measurement
		error.
