		Many Data on State and State-Like Actors in the International
		System // Comprehensively identifying states and state-like
		actors is difficult. This package provides data on states and
		state-like entities in the international system across time.
		The package combines and cross-references several existing
		datasets consistent with the aims and functions of the manydata
		package. It also includes functions for identifying state
		references in text, and for generating fictional state names.
