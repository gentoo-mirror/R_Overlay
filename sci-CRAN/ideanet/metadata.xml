		Integrating Data Exchange and Analysis for Networks ('ideanet')
		// A suite of convenient tools for social network analysis
		geared toward students, entry-level users, and non-expert
		practitioners. ideanet features unique functions for the
		processing and measurement of sociocentric and egocentric
		network data. These functions automatically generate node- and
		system-level measures commonly used in the analysis of these
		types of networks. Outputs from these functions maximize the
		ability of novice users to employ network measurements in
		further analyses while making all users less prone to common
		data analytic errors. Additionally, ideanet features an R Shiny
		graphic user interface that allows novices to explore network
		data with minimal need for coding.
