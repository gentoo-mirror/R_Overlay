		Sample Size Estimations for Planning Multi-Reader Multi-Case
		(MRMC) Studies Without Pilot Data // Sample size estimations
		for MRMC studies based on the Obuchowski-Rockette (OR)
		methodology is implemented. The function can calculate sample
		sizes where the endpoint of interest in the study is either ROC
		AUC (Area-Under-the-Receiver-Operating-Characteristics-Curve)
		or sensitivity. The package can also return sample sizes for
		studies expected to have clustering effect (e.g.- multiple
		pulmonary nodules per patient). All calculations assume that
		the study design is fully crossed (paired-reader, paired-case)
		where each reader reads/interprets each case and that there are
		two interventions/imaging-modalities/techniques in the study.
		In addition to MRMC, it can also be used to estimate sample
		sizes for standalone studies where sensitivity or AUC are the
		primary endpoints. The methods implemented are based on the
		methods described in Zhou et.al. (2011)
		doi:10.1002/9780470906514 and Obuchowski (2000)
		doi:10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181a663cc.
