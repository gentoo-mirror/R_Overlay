		Antigenic Cartography Macros // A toolkit for making antigenic
		maps from immunological assay data, in order to quantify and
		visualize antigenic differences between different pathogen
		strains as described in Smith et al. (2004)
		doi:10.1126/science.1097211 and used in the World Health
		Organization influenza vaccine strain selection process.
		Additional functions allow for the diagnostic evaluation of
		antigenic maps and an interactive viewer is provided to explore
		antigenic relationships amongst several strains and incorporate
		the visualization of associated genetic information.
