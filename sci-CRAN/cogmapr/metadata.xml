		Cognitive Mapping Tools Based on Coding of Textual Sources //
		Functions for building cognitive maps based on qualitative
		data. Inputs are textual sources (articles, transcription of
		qualitative interviews of agents,...). These sources have been
		coded using relations and are linked to (i) a table describing
		the variables (or concepts) used for the coding and (ii) a
		table describing the sources (typology of agents, ...). Main
		outputs are Individual Cognitive Maps (ICM), Social Cognitive
		Maps (all sources or group of sources) and a list of quotes
		linked to relations. This package is linked to the work done
		during the PhD of Frederic M. Vanwindekens (CRA-W / UCL) hold
		the 13 of May 2014 at University of Louvain in collaboration
		with the Walloon Agricultural Research Centre (project MIMOSA,
		MOERMAN fund).
