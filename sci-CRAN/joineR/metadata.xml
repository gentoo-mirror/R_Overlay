		Joint Modelling of Repeated Measurements and Time-to-Event Data
		// Analysis of repeated measurements and time-to-event data via
		random effects joint models. Fits the joint models proposed by
		Henderson and colleagues doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465
		(single event time) and by Williamson and colleagues (2008)
		doi:10.1002/sim.3451 (competing risks events time) to a single
		continuous repeated measure. The time-to-event data is modelled
		using a (cause-specific) Cox proportional hazards regression
		model with time-varying covariates. The longitudinal outcome is
		modelled using a linear mixed effects model. The association is
		captured by a latent Gaussian process. The model is estimated
		using am Expectation Maximization algorithm. Some plotting
		functions and the variogram are also included. This project is
		funded by the Medical Research Council (Grant numbers G0400615
		and MR/M013227/1).
