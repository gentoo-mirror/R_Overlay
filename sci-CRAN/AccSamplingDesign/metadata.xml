		Acceptance Sampling Plans Design // Provides tools for designing
		and analyzing Acceptance Sampling plans. Supports both
		Attributes Sampling (Binomial and Poisson distributions) and
		Variables Sampling (Normal and Beta distributions), enabling
		quality control for fractional and compositional data. Uses
		nonlinear programming for sampling plan optimization,
		minimizing sample size while controlling producer's and
		consumer's risks. Operating Characteristic curves are available
		for plan visualization.
