		Acceptance Sampling Plans Design // Provides tools for designing
		and analyzing acceptance sampling plans. Supports both
		attribute-based (Binomial and Poisson) and variable-based
		(Normal and Beta) sampling, enabling quality control for
		fractional and compositional data. Uses nonlinear programming
		for sampling plan optimization, minimizing sample size while
		balancing producer's and consumer's risks. Operating
		Characteristic curves are available for plan visualization.
