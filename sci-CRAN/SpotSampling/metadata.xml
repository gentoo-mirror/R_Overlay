		SPatial and Optimally Temporal (SPOT) Sampling // In spatial
		data, information of two neighboring units are generally very
		similar. For spatial sampling, it is therefore more efficient
		to select samples that are well spread out in space. Often, the
		interest lies not only in estimating a measure at one point in
		time, but rather in estimating several points in time to also
		study the evolution. Three new methods called Orfs (Optimal
		Rotation with Fixed sample Size), Orsp (Optimal Rotation with
		Spread sample), and Spot (Spatial and Optimally Temporal
		Sampling) are implemented in this package. Orfs allows to
		select temporal samples with fixed size. Orsp selects spatio-
		temporal samples with random size that are well spread out in
		space at each point in time. And Spot generates spread sample
		with fixed sample size at each wave. These methods provide an
		optimal time rotation of the selected units using the
		systematic sampling.
