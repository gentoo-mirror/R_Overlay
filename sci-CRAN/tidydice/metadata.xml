		Simulates Dice Rolls and Coin Flips // Utils for basic
		statistical experiments, that can be used for teaching
		introductory statistics. Each experiment generates a tibble.
		Dice rolls and coin flips are simulated using sample(). The
		properties of the dice can be changed, like the number of
		sides. A coin flip is simulated using a two sided dice.
		Experiments can be combined with the pipe-operator.
