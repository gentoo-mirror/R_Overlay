		Quick Access to Homologene and Gene Annotation Updates // A
		wrapper for the homologene database by the National Center for
		Biotechnology Information ('NCBI'). It allows searching for
		gene homologs across species. Data in this package can be found
		at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/build68/. The package
		also includes an updated version of the homologene database
		where gene identifiers and symbols are replaced with their
		latest (at the time of submission) version and functions to
		fetch latest annotation data to keep updated.
