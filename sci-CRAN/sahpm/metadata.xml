		Variable Selection using Simulated Annealing // Highest posterior
		model is widely accepted as a good model among available
		models. In terms of variable selection highest posterior model
		is often the true model. Our stochastic search process SAHPM
		based on simulated annealing maximization method tries to find
		the highest posterior model by maximizing the model space with
		respect to the posterior probabilities of the models. This
		package currently contains the SAHPM method only for linear
		models. The codes for GLM will be added in future.
