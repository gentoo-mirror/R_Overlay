		Basic Functions in Knowledge Space Theory Using Matrix
		Representation // Knowledge space theory by Doignon and
		Falmagne (1999) doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58625-5 is a set- and
		order-theoretical framework, which proposes mathematical
		formalisms to operationalize knowledge structures in a
		particular domain. The 'kstMatrix' package provides basic
		functionalities to generate, handle, and manipulate knowledge
		structures and knowledge spaces. Opposed to the 'kst' package,
		'kstMatrix' uses matrix representations for knowledge
		structures. Furthermore, 'kstMatrix' contains several knowledge
		spaces developed by the research group around Cornelia Dowling
		through querying experts.
