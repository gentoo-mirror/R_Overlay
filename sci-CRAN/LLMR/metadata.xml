		Interface for Large Language Model APIs in R // Provides a
		unified interface to interact with multiple Large Language
		Model (LLM) APIs. The package supports text generation,
		embeddings, and parallelization.  Users can switch between
		different LLM providers seamlessly within R workflows, or call
		multiple models in parallel. The package enables creation of
		LLM agents for automated tasks and provides consistent error
		handling across all supported APIs. APIs include 'OpenAI' (see
		https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview for details),
		'Anthropic' (see https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-
		started for details), 'Groq' (see
		https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference for details),
		'Together AI' (see https://docs.together.ai/docs/quickstart for
		details), 'DeepSeek' (see https://api-docs.deepseek.com for
		details), 'Gemini' (see https://aistudio.google.com for
		details), and 'Voyage AI' (see
		https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/introduction for details).
