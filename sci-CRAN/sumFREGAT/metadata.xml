		Fast Region-Based Association Tests on Summary Statistics // An
		adaptation of classical region/gene-based association analysis
		techniques that uses summary statistics (P values and effect
		sizes) and correlations between genetic variants as input. It
		is a tool to perform the most common and efficient gene-based
		tests on the results of genome-wide association (meta-)analyses
		without having the original genotypes and phenotypes at hand.
