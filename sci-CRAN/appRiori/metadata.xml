		Code and Obtain Customized Planned Comparisons with 'appRiori' //
		With 'appRiori', users upload the research variables and the
		app guides them to the best set of comparisons fitting the
		hypotheses, for both main and interaction effects. Through a
		graphical explanation and empirical examples on reproducible
		data, it is shown that it is possible to understand both the
		logic behind the planned comparisons and the way to interpret
		them when a model is tested.
