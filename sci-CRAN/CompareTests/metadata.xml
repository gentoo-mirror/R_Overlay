		Correct for Verification Bias in Diagnostic Accuracy  Agreement
		// A standard test is observed on all specimens.  We treat the
		second test (or sampled test) as being conducted on only a
		stratified sample of specimens.  Verification Bias is this
		situation when the specimens for doing the second (sampled)
		test is not under investigator control.  We treat the total
		sample as stratified two-phase sampling and use inverse
		probability weighting.  We estimate diagnostic accuracy
		(category-specific classification probabilities; for binary
		tests reduces to specificity and sensitivity, and also
		predictive values) and agreement statistics (percent agreement,
		percent agreement by category, Kappa (unweighted), Kappa
		(quadratic weighted) and symmetry tests (reduces to McNemar's
		test for binary tests)).  See: Katki HA, Li Y, Edelstein DW,
		Castle PE.  Estimating the agreement and diagnostic accuracy of
		two diagnostic tests when one test is conducted on only a
		subsample of specimens. Stat Med. 2012 Feb 28; 31(5)
