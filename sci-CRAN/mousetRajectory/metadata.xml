		Mouse Trajectory Analyses for Behavioural Scientists // Helping
		psychologists and other behavioural scientists to analyze mouse
		movement (and other 2-D trajectory) data. Bundles together
		several functions that compute spatial measures (e.g., maximum
		absolute deviation, area under the curve, sample entropy) or
		provide a shorthand for procedures that are frequently used
		(e.g., time normalization, linear interpolation, extracting
		initiation and movement times). For more information on these
		dependent measures, see Wirth et al. (2020)
