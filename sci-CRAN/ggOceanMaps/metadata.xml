		Plot Data on Oceanographic Maps using 'ggplot2' // Allows
		plotting data on bathymetric maps using 'ggplot2'. Plotting
		oceanographic spatial data is made as simple as feasible, but
		also flexible for custom modifications. Data that contain
		geographic information from anywhere around the globe can be
		plotted on maps generated by the basemap() or qmap() functions
		using 'ggplot2' layers separated by the '+' operator. The
		package uses spatial shape- ('sf') and raster ('stars') files,
		geospatial packages for R to manipulate, and the 'ggplot2'
		package to plot these files. The package ships with low-
		resolution spatial data files and higher resolution files for
		detailed maps are stored in the 'ggOceanMapsLargeData'
		repository on GitHub and downloaded automatically when needed.
