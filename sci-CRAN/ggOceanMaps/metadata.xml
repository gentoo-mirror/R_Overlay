		Plot Data on Oceanographic Maps using 'ggplot2' // Allows
		plotting data on bathymetric maps using 'ggplot2'. Plotting
		oceanographic spatial data is made as simple as feasible, but
		also flexible for custom modifications. Data that contain
		geographic information from anywhere around the globe can be
		plotted on maps generated by the basemap() or qmap() functions
		using 'ggplot2' layers separated by the '+' operator. The
		package uses spatial shapefiles stored in the 'ggOceanMapsData'
		package, geospatial packages for R to manipulate, and the
		'ggspatial' package to help to plot these shapefiles. High-
		resolution shapefiles for detailed maps are stored on GitHub
		and downloaded automatically when needed.
