		Discrete Boosting Logistic Regression // Trains logistic
		regression model by discretizing continuous variables via
		gradient boosting approach. The proposed method tries to
		achieve a tradeoff between interpretation and prediction
		accuracy for logistic regression by discretizing the continuous
		variables. The variable binning is accomplished in a supervised
		fashion. The model trained by this package is still a single
		logistic regression model, but not a sequence of logistic
		regression models. The fitted model object returned from the
		model training consists of two tables. One table is used to
		give the boundaries of bins for each continuous variable as
		well as the corresponding coefficients, and the other one is
		used for discrete variables. This package can also be used for
		binning continuous variables for other statistical analysis.
