		Bayesian Hierarchical Regression on Clearance Rates in the
		Presence of Lag and Tail Phases // An implementation of the
		Bayesian Clearance Estimator (Fogarty et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1111/biom.12307). It takes serial measurements of a
		response on an individual (e.g., parasite load after treatment)
		that is decaying over time and performs Bayesian hierarchical
		regression of the clearance rates on the given covariates. This
		package provides tools to calculate WWARN PCE (WorldWide
		Antimalarial Resistance Network's Parasite Clearance Estimator)
		estimates of the clearance rates as well.
