		Bayesian Estimation of Bivariate Volatility Model // The
		Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
		Heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) models are used for modelling the
		volatile multivariate data sets. In this package a variant of
		MGARCH called BEKK (Baba, Engle, Kraft, Kroner) proposed by
		Engle and Kroner (1995) http://www.jstor.org/stable/3532933 has
		been used to estimate the bivariate time series data using
		Bayesian technique.
