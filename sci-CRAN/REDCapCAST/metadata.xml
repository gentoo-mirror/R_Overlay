		REDCap Metadata Casting and Castellated Data Handling // Casting
		metadata for REDCap database creation and handling of
		castellated data using repeated instruments and longitudinal
		projects in 'REDCap'. Keeps a focused data export approach, by
		allowing to only export required data from the database. Also
		for casting new REDCap databases based on datasets from other
		sources. Originally forked from the R part of 'REDCapRITS' by
		Paul Egeler. See https://github.com/pegeler/REDCapRITS.
		'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-
		based software platform designed to support data capture for
		research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for
		validated data capture; 2) audit trails for tracking data
		manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export
		procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical
		packages; and 4) procedures for data integration and
		interoperability with external sources (Harris et al (2009)
