		REDCap Castellated Data Handling // Forked from 'REDCapRITS' by
		Paul Egeler and Spectrum Health. See
		https://github.com/SpectrumHealthResearch/REDCapRITS. Handles
		castellated datasets from 'REDCap' projects with repeating
		instruments. Assists in casting tidy tables from raw 'REDCap'
		data exports for each repeated instrument. Keeps a focused data
		export approach, by allowing to only export required data from
		the database. 'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a
		secure, web-based software platform designed to support data
		capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive
		interface for validated data capture; 2) audit trails for
		tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated
		export procedures for seamless data downloads to common
		statistical packages; and 4) procedures for data integration
		and interoperability with external sources (Harris et al (2009)
