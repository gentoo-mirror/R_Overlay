		Mediation Analysis with Missing Data and Non-Normal Data //
		Methods for mediation analysis with missing data and non-normal
		data are implemented. For missing data, four methods are
		available: Listwise deletion, Pairwise deletion, Multiple
		imputation, and Two Stage Maximum Likelihood algorithm. For MI
		and TS-ML, auxiliary variables can be included to handle
		missing data. For handling non-normal data, bootstrap and two-
		stage robust methods can be used. Technical details of the
		methods can be found in Zhang and Wang (2013,
		doi:10.1007/s11336-012-9301-5), Zhang (2014,
		doi:10.3758/s13428-013-0424-0), and Yuan and Zhang (2012,
		doi:10.1007/s11336-012-9282-4).
