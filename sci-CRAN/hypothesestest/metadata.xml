		Confidence Intervals and Tests of Statistical Hypotheses //
		Compute the confidence interval of the population mean with one
		sample or of the difference of population means of two samples
		from normal distributions or t-distributions.Compute the
		confidence interval of population variance with one sample or
		of the difference of population variances of two samples by
		chi-square tests.Test for population mean or the differences of
		two normal samples under normality with the given null
		hypothesis H0,which depends on the user,so that he can know if
		he can reject H0 or not at the significance level alpha.Do the
		chi-square tests with one or two samples which have multinomial
		distributions by using an approximate chi-square distribution
		when n is large enough.
