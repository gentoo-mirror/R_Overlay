		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Lightweight
		parallel code execution, local or distributed across the
		network. Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an
		arbitrary expression asynchronously, resolving automatically
		upon completion. Built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next
		Gen), uses scalability protocols not subject to R connection
		limits and transports faster than TCP/IP where applicable.
