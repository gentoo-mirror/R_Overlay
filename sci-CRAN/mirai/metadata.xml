		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Designed for
		simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously
		in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the network.
		The result is automatically available upon completion. Modern
		networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG'
		(Nanomsg Next Gen), ensures reliable and efficient scheduling
		over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by
		TLS. Distributed computing can launch remote resources via SSH
		or cluster managers. An inherently queued architecture handles
		many more tasks than available processes, and requires no
		storage on the file system. Innovative features include support
		for otherwise non-exportable reference objects, event-driven
		promises, and asynchronous parallel map.
