		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Designed for
		simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously
		in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the network.
		Modern networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and
		'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen), ensures reliable and efficient
		scheduling over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP
		secured by TLS. Distributed computing can launch remote
		resources via SSH or cluster managers. A queued architecture
		readily handles more tasks than available processes, requiring
		no storage on the file system. Innovative features include
		event-driven promises, asynchronous parallel map, and automatic
		serialization of otherwise non-exportable reference objects.
