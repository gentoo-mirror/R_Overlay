		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Lightweight
		parallel code execution, local or distributed across the
		network. Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an
		arbitrary expression asynchronously, resolving automatically
		upon completion. Built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next
		Gen) scalability protocols, defaults to the optimal choice of
		abstract sockets, Unix domain sockets or named pipes in
		addition to TCP/IP.
