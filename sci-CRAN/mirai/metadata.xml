		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Lightweight
		parallel code execution and distributed computing. Designed for
		simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously,
		on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon
		completion. State of the art networking and concurrency via
		'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) offers reliable and
		efficient scheduling over fast inter-process communications or
		TCP/IP secured by TLS.
