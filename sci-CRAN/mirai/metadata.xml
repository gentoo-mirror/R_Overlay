		parallel code execution and distributed computing. Designed for
		simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously,
		on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon
		completion. Features efficient task scheduling, fast inter-
		process communications, and Transport Layer Security over
		TCP/IP for remote connections, courtesy of 'nanonext' and 'NNG'
		(Nanomsg Next Gen).
