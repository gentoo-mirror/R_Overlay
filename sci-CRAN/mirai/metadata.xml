		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Lightweight
		parallel code execution, local or distributed across the
		network. Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an
		arbitrary expression asynchronously, resolving automatically
		upon completion. Leverages 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next
		Gen) to provide efficient task scheduling, scalability beyond R
		connection limits, and transports faster than TCP/IP for inter-
		process communications.
