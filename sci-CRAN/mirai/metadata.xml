		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Designed for
		simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously
		in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the network,
		with the result automatically available upon completion. Modern
		networking and concurrency built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG'
		(Nanomsg Next Gen) ensure reliable and efficient scheduling,
		over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by
		TLS. Advantages include being inherently queued thus handling
		many more tasks than available processes, no storage on the
		file system, support for otherwise non-exportable reference
		objects, an event-driven promises implementation, and built-in
		asynchronous parallel map.
