		Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R // Designed for
		simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously
		in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the network.
		Modern networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and
		'NNG', ensures reliable scheduling over fast inter-process
		communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.  Launch remote
		resources via SSH or cluster managers for distributed
		computing. The queued architecture scales efficiently to
		millions of tasks over thousands of connections, requiring no
		storage on the file system.  Innovative features include event-
		driven promises, asynchronous parallel map, and seamless
		serialization of otherwise non-exportable reference objects.
