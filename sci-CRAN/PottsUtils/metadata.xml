		Utility Functions of the Potts Models // There are three sets of
		functions. The first produces basic properties of a graph and
		generates samples from multinomial distributions to facilitate
		the simulation functions (they maybe used for other purposes as
		well). The second provides various simulation functions for a
		Potts model in Potts, R. B. (1952)
		doi:10.1017/S0305004100027419. The third currently includes
		only one function which computes the normalizing constant of a
		Potts model based on simulation results.
