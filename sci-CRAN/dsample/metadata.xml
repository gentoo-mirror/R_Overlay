		Discretization-Based Direct Random Sample Generation //
		Discretization-based random sampling algorithm that is useful
		for a complex model in high dimension is implemented. The
		normalizing constant of a target distribution is not needed.
		Posterior summaries are compared with those by 'OpenBUGS'. The
		method is described: Wang and Lee (2014)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.06.011 and exercised in Lee (2009)
