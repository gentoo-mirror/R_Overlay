		Manipulating and Analysing EQ-5d Data // The EQ-5D is a widely-
		used standarized instrument for measuring Health Related
		Quality Of Life (HRQOL), developed by the EuroQol group
		https://euroqol.org/. It assesses five dimensions; mobility,
		self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and
		anxiety/depression, using either a three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or
		five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale. Scores from these dimensions are
		commonly converted into a single utility index using country-
		specific value sets, which are critical in clinical and
		economic evaluations of healthcare and in population health
		surveys. The eq5dsuite package enables users to calculate
		utility index values for the EQ-5D instruments, including
		crosswalk utilities using the original crosswalk developed by
		van Hout et al. (2012) doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008 (mapping
		EQ-5D-5L responses to EQ-5D-3L index values), or the recently
		developed reverse crosswalk by van Hout et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1016/j.jval.2021.03.009 (mapping EQ-5D-3L responses to
		EQ-5D-5L index values). Users are allowed to add and/or remove
		user-defined value sets. Additionally, the package provides
		tools to analyze EQ-5D data according to the recommended
		guidelines outlined in "Methods for Analyzing and Reporting
		EQ-5D data" by Devlin et al. (2020)
