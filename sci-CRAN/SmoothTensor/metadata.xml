		A Collection of Smooth Tensor Estimation Methods // A list of
		methods for estimating a smooth tensor with an unknown
		permutation. It also contains several multi-variate functions
		for generating permuted signal tensors and corresponding
		observed tensors. For a detailed introduction for the model and
		estimation techniques, see the paper by Chanwoo Lee and Miaoyan
		Wang (2021) "Smooth tensor estimation with unknown
		permutations" arXiv:2111.04681.
