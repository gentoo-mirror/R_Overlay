		Enhanced 'R Markdown' Format for 'Word' and 'PowerPoint' //
		Allows production of 'Microsoft' corporate documents from 'R
		Markdown' by reusing formatting defined in 'Microsoft Word'
		documents. You can reuse table styles, list styles but also add
		column sections, landscape oriented pages. Table and image
		captions as well as cross-references are transformed into
		'Microsoft Word' fields, allowing documents edition and merging
		without issue with references; the syntax conforms to the
		'bookdown' cross-reference definition. Objects generated by the
		'officer' package are also supported in the 'knitr' chunks.
		'Microsoft PowerPoint' presentations also benefit from this as
		well as the ability to produce editable vector graphics in
		'PowerPoint' and also to define placeholder where content is to
		be added.
