		Core Utilities for Developing and Running Spatially Explicit
		Discrete Event Simulation Models // Provide the core discrete
		event simulation (DES) framework for implementing spatially
		explicit simulation models. The core DES components facilitate
		modularity, and easily enable the user to include additional
		functionality by running user-built simulation modules.
