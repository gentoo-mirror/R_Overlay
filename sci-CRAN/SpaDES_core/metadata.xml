		Core Utilities for Developing and Running Spatially Explicit
		Discrete Event Models // Provide the core framework for a
		discrete event system (DES) to implement a complete data-to-
		decisions, reproducible workflow. The core DES components
		facilitate modularity, and easily enable the user to include
		additional functionality by running user-built modules.
		Includes conditional scheduling, restart after interruption,
		packaging of reusable modules, tools for developing arbitrary
		automated workflows, automated interweaving of modules of
		different temporal resolution, and tools for visualizing and
		understanding the DES project.
