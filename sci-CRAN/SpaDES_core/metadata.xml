		Core Utilities for Developing and Running Spatially Explicit
		Discrete Event Models // Provides the core framework for a
		discrete event system to implement a complete data-to-
		decisions, reproducible workflow. The core components
		facilitate the development of modular pieces, and enable the
		user to include additional functionality by running user-built
		modules. Includes conditional scheduling, restart after
		interruption, packaging of reusable modules, tools for
		developing arbitrary automated workflows, automated
		interweaving of modules of different temporal resolution, and
		tools for visualizing and understanding the within-project
		dependencies. The suggested package 'NLMR' can be installed
		from the repository (https://PredictiveEcology.r-universe.dev).
