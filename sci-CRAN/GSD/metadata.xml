		Graph Signal Decomposition // Graph signals residing on the
		vertices of a graph have recently gained prominence in research
		in various fields. Many methodologies have been proposed to
		analyze graph signals by adapting classical signal processing
		tools. Recently, several notable graph signal decomposition
		methods have been proposed, which include graph Fourier
		decomposition based on graph Fourier transform, graph empirical
		mode decomposition, and statistical graph empirical mode
		decomposition. This package efficiently implements multiscale
		analysis applicable to various fields, and offers an effective
		tool for visualizing and decomposing graph signals. For the
		detailed methodology, see Ortega et al. (2018)
