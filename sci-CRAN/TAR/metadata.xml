		Bayesian Modeling of Autoregressive Threshold Time Series Models
		// Identification and estimation of the autoregressive
		threshold models with Gaussian noise, as well as positive-
		valued time series. The package provides the identification of
		the number of regimes, the thresholds and the autoregressive
		orders, as well as the estimation of remain parameters. The
		package implements the methodology from the 2005 paper:
		Modeling Bivariate Threshold Autoregressive Processes in the
		Presence of Missing Data DOI:10.1081/STA-200054435.
