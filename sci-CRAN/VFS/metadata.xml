		Vegetated Filter Strip and Erosion Model // Empirical models for
		runoff, erosion, and phosphorus loss across a vegetated filter
		strip, given slope, soils, climate, and vegetation (Gall et
		al., 2018) doi:10.1007/s00477-017-1505-x. It also includes
		functions for deriving climate parameters from measured daily
		weather data, and for simulating rainfall. Models implemented
		include MUSLE (Williams, 1975) and APLE (Vadas et al., 2009
		doi:10.2134/jeq2008.0337).
