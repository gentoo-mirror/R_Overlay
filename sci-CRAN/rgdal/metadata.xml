		Bindings for the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library //
		Provides bindings to the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library
		('GDAL') (= 1.11.4) and access to projection/transformation
		operations from the 'PROJ.4' library. The 'GDAL' and 'PROJ.4'
		libraries are external to the package, and, when installing the
		package from source, must be correctly installed first. From
		'rgdal' 1.4.1, provision is made for 'PROJ6' accommodation,
		with 'PROJ6' functionality to follow; from 1.4.1 'rgdal' will
		build and function when 'PROJ' = 6. Both 'GDAL' raster and
		'OGR' vector map data can be imported into R, and 'GDAL' raster
		data and 'OGR' vector data exported. Use is made of classes
		defined in the 'sp' package. Windows and Mac Intel OS X
		binaries (including 'GDAL', 'PROJ.4' and 'Expat') are provided
		on 'CRAN'.
