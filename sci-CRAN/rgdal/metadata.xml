		Bindings for the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library //
		Provides bindings to the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library
		('GDAL') (= 1.11.4) and access to projection/transformation
		operations from the 'PROJ.4' library. The 'GDAL' and 'PROJ.4'
		libraries are external to the package, and, when installing the
		package from source, must be correctly installed first. Both
		'GDAL' raster and 'OGR' vector map data can be imported into R,
		and 'GDAL' raster data and 'OGR' vector data exported. Use is
		made of classes defined in the 'sp' package. Windows and Mac
		Intel OS X binaries (including 'GDAL', 'PROJ.4' and 'Expat')
		are provided on 'CRAN'.
