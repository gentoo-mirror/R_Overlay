		Disaster Alert and Sentiment Analysis // By systematically
		aggregating and processing textual reports from earthquakes,
		floods, storms, wildfires, and other natural disasters, the
		framework enables a holistic assessment of crisis narratives.
		Intelligent cleaning and normalization techniques transform raw
		commentary into structured data, ensuring precise extraction of
		disaster-specific insights. Collective sentiments of affected
		communities are quantitatively scored and qualitatively
		categorized, providing a multifaceted view of societal
		responses under duress. Interactive geographic maps and
		temporal charts illustrate the evolution and spatial dispersion
		of emotional reactions and impact indicators.
