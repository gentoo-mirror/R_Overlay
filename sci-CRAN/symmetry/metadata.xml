		Testing for Symmetry of Data and Model Residuals //
		Implementations of a large number of tests for symmetry and
		their bootstrap variants, which can be used for testing the
		symmetry of random samples around a known or unknown mean.
		Functions are also there for testing the symmetry of model
		residuals around zero. Currently, the supported models are
		linear models and generalized autoregressive conditional
		heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models (fitted with the 'fGarch'
		package). All tests are implemented using the 'Rcpp' package
		which ensures great performance of the code.
