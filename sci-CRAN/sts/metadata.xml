		Estimation of the Structural Topic and Sentiment-Discourse Model
		for Text Analysis // The Structural Topic and Sentiment-
		Discourse (STS) model allows researchers to estimate topic
		models with document-level metadata that determines both topic
		prevalence and sentiment-discourse. The sentiment-discourse is
		modeled as a document-level latent variable for each topic that
		modulates the word frequency within a topic. These latent topic
		sentiment-discourse variables are controlled by the document-
		level metadata. The STS model can be useful for regression
		analysis with text data in addition to topic modelings
		traditional use of descriptive analysis. The method was
		developed in Li and Mankad (2024) doi:10.2139/ssrn.4020651.
