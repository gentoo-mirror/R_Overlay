		Geometry Decomposition // Build a map of path-based geometry,
		this is a simple description of the number of parts in an
		object and their basic structure. Translation and restructuring
		operations for planar shapes and other hierarchical types
		require a data model with a record of the underlying
		relationships between elements. The gibble() function creates a
		geometry map, a simple record of the underlying structure in
		path-based hierarchical types. There are methods for the planar
		shape types in the 'sf' and 'sp' packages.
