		Average Treatment Effects with Measurement Error and Variable
		Selection for Confounders // A recent method proposed by Yi and
		Chen (2023) doi:10.1177/09622802221146308 is used to estimate
		the average treatment effects using noisy data containing both
		measurement error and spurious variables. The package 'AteMeVs'
		contains a set of functions that provide a step-by-step
		estimation procedure, including the correction of the
		measurement error effects, variable selection for building the
		model used to estimate the propensity scores, and estimation of
		the average treatment effects. The functions contain multiple
		options for users to implement, including different ways to
		correct for the measurement error effects, distinct choices of
		penalty functions to do variable selection, and various
		regression models to characterize propensity scores.
