		Open Software for Teaching Evolutionary Biology at Multiple
		Scales Through Virtual Inquiries // "Evolutionary Virtual
		Education" - 'evolved' - provides multiple tools to help
		educators (especially at the graduate level or in advanced
		undergraduate level courses) apply inquiry-based learning in
		general evolution classes. In particular, the tools provided
		include functions that simulate evolutionary processes (e.g.,
		genetic drift, natural selection within a single locus) or
		concepts (e.g. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, phylogenetic
		distribution of traits). More than only simulating, the package
		also provides tools for students to analyze (e.g., measuring,
		testing, visualizing) datasets with characteristics that are
		common to many fields related to evolutionary biology.
		Importantly, the package is heavily oriented towards providing
		tools for inquiry-based learning - where students follow
		scientific practices to actively construct knowledge. For
		additional details, see package's vignettes.
