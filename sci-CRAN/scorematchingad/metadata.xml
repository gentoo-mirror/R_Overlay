		Score Matching Estimation by Automatic Differentiation //
		Hyvrinen's score matching (Hyvrinen, 2005)
		https://jmlr.org/papers/v6/hyvarinen05a.html is a useful
		estimation technique when the normalising constant for a
		probability distribution is difficult to compute. This package
		implements score matching estimators using automatic
		differentiation in the 'CppAD' library https://github.com/coin-
		or/CppAD and is designed for quickly implementing score
		matching estimators for new models. Also available is general
		robustification (Windham, 1995)
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346159. Already in the package
		are estimators for directional distributions (Mardia, Kent and
		Laha, 2016) doi:10.48550/arXiv.1604.08470 and the flexible
		Polynomially-Tilted Pairwise Interaction model for
		compositional data. The latter estimators perform well when
		there are zeros in the compositions (Scealy and Wood, 2023)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.2016422, even many zeros (Scealy,
		Hingee, Kent, and Wood, 2024) doi:10.1007/s11222-024-10412-w.
