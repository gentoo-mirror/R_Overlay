		Causal Discovery under a Confounder Blanket // Methods for
		learning causal relationships among a set of foreground
		variables X based on signals from a (potentially much larger)
		set of background variables Z, which are known non-descendants
		of X. The confounder blanket learner (CBL) uses sparse
		regression techniques to simultaneously perform many
		conditional independence tests, with complementary pairs
		stability selection to guarantee finite sample error control.
		CBL is sound and complete with respect to a so-called "lazy
		oracle", and works with both linear and nonlinear systems. For
		details, see Watson  Silva (2022) arXiv:2205.05715.
