		Power Calculations for Cluster-Randomized and Cluster-Randomized
		Crossover Trials // Calculate power for cluster randomized
		trials (CRTs) that compare two means, two proportions, or two
		counts using closed-form solutions. In addition, calculate
		power for cluster randomized  crossover trials using Monte
		Carlo methods. For more information, see Reich et al. (2012)
