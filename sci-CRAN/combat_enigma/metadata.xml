		Fit and Apply ComBat Harmonization for ENIGMA // Fit and apply
		ComBat to harmonize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from
		different sites. Briefly, ComBat is a batch adjustment method
		that removes additive and multiplicative differences between
		sites due to the use of different scanning devices. As detailed
		in the manual, the original function was first modified for the
		harmonization of MRI data (Fortin et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.024) and then modified again
		to create separate functions for fitting and applying the
		harmonization and allow missing values and constant rows for
		its use within the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through
		Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium (Radua et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.024). This package includes
		the latter version.
