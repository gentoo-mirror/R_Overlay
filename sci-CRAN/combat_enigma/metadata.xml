		Fit and Apply ComBat, LMM, or Prescaling Harmonization for ENIGMA
		and Other Multisite MRI Data // Fit and apply ComBat, linear
		mixed-effects models (LMM), or prescaling to harmonize magnetic
		resonance imaging (MRI) data from different sites. Briefly,
		these methods remove differences between sites due to using
		different scanning devices, and LMM additionally tests linear
		hypotheses. As detailed in the manual, the original ComBat
		function was first modified for the harmonization of MRI data
		(Fortin et al. (2017) doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.024) and
		then modified again to create separate functions for fitting
		and applying the harmonization and allow missing values and
		constant rows for its use within the Enhancing Neuro Imaging
		Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium (Radua et
		al. (2020) doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116956); this package
		includes the latter version. LMM calls "lme" massively
		considering specific brain imaging details. Finally, prescaling
		is a good option for fMRI, where different devices can have
		varying units of measurement.
