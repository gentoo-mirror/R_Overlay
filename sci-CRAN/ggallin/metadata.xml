		Grab Bag of 'ggplot2' Functions // Extra geoms and scales for
		'ggplot2', including geom_cloud(), a Normal density cloud
		replacement for errorbars; transforms ssqrt_trans and
		pseudolog10_trans, which are loglike but appropriate for
		negative data; interp_trans() and warp_trans() which provide
		scale transforms based on interpolation; and an infix compose
		operator for scale transforms.
