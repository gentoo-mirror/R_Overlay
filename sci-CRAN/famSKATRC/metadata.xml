		Family Sequence Kernel Association Test for Rare and Common
		Variants // FamSKAT-RC is a family-based association kernel
		test for both rare and common variants. This test is general
		and several special cases are known as other methods: famSKAT,
		which only focuses on rare variants in family-based data, SKAT,
		which focuses on rare variants in population-based data
		(unrelated individuals), and SKAT-RC, which focuses on both
		rare and common variants in population-based data. When one
		applies famSKAT-RC and sets the value of phi to 1, famSKAT-RC
		becomes famSKAT. When one applies famSKAT-RC and set the value
		of phi to 1 and the kinship matrix to the identity matrix,
		famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT. When one applies famSKAT-RC and set
		the kinship matrix (fullkins) to the identity matrix (and phi
		is not equal to 1), famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT-RC. We also include
		a small sample synthetic pedigree to demonstrate the method
		with. For more details see Saad M and Wijsman EM (2014)
