		A General Algorithm to Enhance the Performance of Variable
		Selection Methods in Correlated Datasets // An implementation
		of the selectboost algorithm (Bertrand et al. 2020,
		'Bioinformatics', doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa855), which is
		a general algorithm that improves the precision of any existing
		variable selection method. This algorithm is based on highly
		intensive simulations and takes into account the correlation
		structure of the data. It can either produce a confidence index
		for variable selection or it can be used in an experimental
		design planning perspective.
