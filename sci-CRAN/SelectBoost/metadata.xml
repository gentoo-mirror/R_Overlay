		A General Algorithm to Enhance the Performance of Variable
		Selection Methods in Correlated Datasets // An implementation
		of the selectboost algorithm (Aouadi et al. 2018,
		arXiv:1810.01670), which is a general algorithm that improves
		the precision of any existing variable selection method. This
		algorithm is based on highly intensive simulations and takes
		into account the correlation structure of the data. It can
		either produce a confidence index for variable selection or it
		can be used in an experimental design planning perspective.
