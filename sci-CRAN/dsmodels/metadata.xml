		A Language to Facilitate Simulation and Visualization of Two-
		Dimensional Dynamical Systems // An expressive language to
		facilitate simulation and visualization of two-dimensional
		dynamical systems. The basic elements of the language are a
		model wrapping around a function(x,y) which outputs a list(x =
		xprime, y = yprime), and a range. The language supports three
		types of visual objects: visualizations, features, and
		backgrounds. Visualizations, including dots and arrows, depict
		the behavior of the dynamical system over the entire range.
		Features display user-defined curves and points, and their
		images under the system. Backgrounds define and color regions
		of interest, such as basins of attraction. The language can
		also approximate attractors and their basins through
		simulation.
