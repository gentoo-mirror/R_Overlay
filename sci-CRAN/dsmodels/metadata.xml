		A Language to Facilitate the Creation and Visualization of Two-
		Dimensional Dynamical Systems // An expressive language to
		facilitate the creation and visualization of two-dimensional
		dynamical systems. The basic elements of the language are a
		model wrapping around a function(x,y) which outputs a list(x =
		xprime, y = yprime), and a range. The language supports three
		types of visual objects: visualizations, features, and
		backgrounds. Visualizations, including dots and arrows, depict
		the behavior of the dynamical system over the entire range.
		Features display user-defined curves and points, and their
		images under the system. Backgrounds define and color regions
		of interest, such as areas of convergence and divergence. The
		language can also automatically guess attractors and regions of
		convergence and divergence.
