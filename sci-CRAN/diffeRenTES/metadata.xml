		Computation of TES-Based Cell Differentiation Trees // Computes
		the ATM (Attractor Transition Matrix) structure and the tree-
		like structure describing the cell differentiation process
		(based on the Threshold Ergodic Set concept introduced by Serra
		and Villani), starting from the Boolean networks with
		synchronous updating scheme of the 'BoolNet' R package. TESs
		(Threshold Ergodic Sets) are the mathematical abstractions that
		represent the different cell types arising during ontogenesis.
		TESs and the powerful model of biological differentiation based
		on Boolean networks to which it belongs have been firstly
		described in "A Dynamical Model of Genetic Networks for Cell
		Differentiation" Villani M, Barbieri A, Serra R (2011) A
		Dynamical Model of Genetic Networks for Cell Differentiation.
