		Bayesian Graphical Estimation using Spike-and-Slab Priors // For
		Bayesian inference in undirected graphical models using spike-
		and-slab priors, continuous, discrete, and mixed data. The
		package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian
		graphical models' literature, including Wang (2015)
		doi:10.1214/14-BA916. To speed up the computations, the
		computationally intensive tasks of the package are implemented
		in C++ in parallel using OpenMP.
