		Bayesian Graphical Estimation using Spike-and-Slab Priors //
		Bayesian estimation for undirected graphical models using
		spike-and-slab priors. The package handles continuous,
		discrete, and mixed data. To speed up the computations, the
		computationally intensive tasks of the package are implemented
		in C++ in parallel using OpenMP.
