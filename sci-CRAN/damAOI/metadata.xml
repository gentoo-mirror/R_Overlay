		Create an 'Area of Interest' Around a Constructed Dam for
		Comparative Impact Evaluations // Define a spatial 'Area of
		Interest' (AOI) around a constructed dam using hydrology data.
		Dams have environmental and social impacts, both positive and
		negative. Current analyses of dams have no consistent way to
		specify at what spatial extent we should evaluate these
		impacts. 'damAOI' implements methods to adjust reservoir
		polygons to match satellite-observed surface water areas, plot
		upstream and downstream rivers using elevation data and
		accumulated river flow, and draw buffers clipped by river
		basins around reservoirs and relevant rivers. This helps to
		consistently determine the areas which could be impacted by dam
		construction, facilitating comparative analysis and informed
		infrastructure investments.
