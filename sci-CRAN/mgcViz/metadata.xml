		Visualisations for Generalized Additive Models // Extension of
		the 'mgcv' package, providing visual tools for Generalized
		Additive Models (GAMs) that exploit the additive structure of
		GAMs, scale to large data sets and can be used in conjunction
		with a wide range of response distributions. The focus is
		providing visual methods for better understanding the model
		output and for aiding model checking and development beyond
		simple exponential family regression. The graphical framework
		is based on the layering system provided by 'ggplot2'.
