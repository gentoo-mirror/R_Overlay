		Local Bootstrap Methods for Various Networks // Network analysis
		usually requires estimating the uncertainty of graph
		statistics. Through this package, we provide tools to bootstrap
		various networks via local bootstrap procedure. Additionally,
		it includes functions for generating probability matrices,
		creating network adjacency matrices from probability matrices,
		and plotting network structures. The reference will be updated
