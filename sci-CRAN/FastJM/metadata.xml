		Semi-Parametric Joint Modeling of Survival and Longitudinal Data
		// Maximum likelihood estimation for the semi-parametric joint
		modeling of competing risks and longitudinal data applying one
		way scan algorithm, proposed by Li and colleagues (2021)
		arXiv:2110.14822. The time-to-event data is modelled using a
		(cause-specific) Cox proportional hazards regression model with
		time-fixed covariates. The longitudinal outcome is modelled
		using a linear mixed effects model. The association is captured
		by shared random effects. The model is estimated using am
		Expectation Maximization algorithm.
