		Semi-Parametric Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Survival Data
		// Maximum likelihood estimation for the semi-parametric joint
		modeling of competing risks and longitudinal data applying
		customized linear scan algorithms, proposed by Li and
		colleagues (2022) doi:10.1155/2022/1362913. The time-to-event
		data is modelled using a (cause-specific) Cox proportional
		hazards regression model with time-fixed covariates. The
		longitudinal outcome is modelled using a linear mixed effects
		model. The association is captured by shared random effects.
		The model is estimated using an Expectation Maximization
		algorithm.
