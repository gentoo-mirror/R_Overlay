		Distribution Optimization // Fits Gaussian Mixtures by applying
		evolution. As fitness function a mixture of the chi square test
		for distributions and a novel measure for approximating the
		common area under curves between multiple Gaussians is used.
		The package presents an alternative to the commonly used
		Likelihood Maximization as is used in Expectation Maximization.
		The evolution is based on the 'GA' package: Luca Scrucca (2013)

		stems from 'AdaptGauss': Alfred Ultsch, Michael Thrun, Onno
