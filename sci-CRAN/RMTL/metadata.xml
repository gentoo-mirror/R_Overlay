		Regularized Multi-Task Learning // Efficient solvers for 10
		regularized multi-task learning algorithms applicable for
		regression, classification, joint feature selection, task
		clustering, low-rank learning, sparse learning and network
		incorporation. Based on the accelerated gradient descent
		method, the algorithms feature a state-of-art computational
		complexity O(1/k^2). Sparse model structure is induced by the
		solving the proximal operator. The detail of the package is
		described in the paper of Han Cao and Emanuel Schwarz (2018)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty831.
