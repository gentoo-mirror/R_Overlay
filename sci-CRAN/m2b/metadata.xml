		Movement to Behaviour Inference using Random Forest // Prediction
		of behaviour from movement characteristics using observation
		and random forest for the analyses of movement data in ecology.
		From movement information (speed, bearing...) the model
		predicts the observed behaviour (movement, foraging...) using
		random forest. The model can then extrapolate behavioural
		information to movement data without direct observation of
		behaviours. The specificity of this method relies on the
		derivation of multiple predictor variables from the movement
		data over a range of temporal windows. This procedure allows to
		capture as much information as possible on the changes and
		variations of movement and ensures the use of the random forest
		algorithm to its best capacity. The method is very generic,
		applicable to any set of data providing movement data together
		with observation of behaviour.
