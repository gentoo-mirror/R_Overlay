		Time series costationarity determination // Contains functions
		that can determine whether a time series is second-order
		stationary or not (and hence evidence for locally
		stationarity). Given two non-stationary series (i.e. locally
		stationary series) this package can then discover time-varying
		linear combinations that are second-order stationary.
