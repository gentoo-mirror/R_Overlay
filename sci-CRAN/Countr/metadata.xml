		Flexible Univariate Count Models Based on Renewal Processes //
		Flexible univariate count models based on renewal processes.
		The models may include covariates and can be specified with
		familiar formula syntax as in glm() and package 'flexsurv'.
		The methodology is described by Kharrat et all (2019)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i13 (included as vignette 'Countr_guide'
		in the package). If the suggested package 'pscl' is not
		available from CRAN, it can be installed with
		'remotes::install_github("cran/pscl")'. It is no longer used by
		the functions in this package but is needed for some of the
		extended examples.
