		Straightforward 'NetCDF' Metadata // Extract metadata from
		'NetCDF' data sources, these can be files, file handles or
		servers. This package leverages and extends the lower level
		functions of the 'RNetCDF' package providing a consistent set
		of functions that all return data frames. We introduce named
		concepts of 'grid', 'axis' and 'source' which are all
		meaningful entities without formal definition in the 'NetCDF'
		library https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/.
		'RNetCDF' matches the library itself with only the named
		concepts of 'variables', 'dimensions' and 'attributes'.
