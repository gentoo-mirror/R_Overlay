		Robust P-Value Combination Methods // The meta-analysis is
		performed to increase the statistical power by integrating the
		results from several experiments. The p-values are often
		combined in meta-analysis when the effect sizes are not
		available. The 'metapro' R package provides not only
		traditional methods (Becker BJ (1994, ISBN:0-87154-226-9),
		Mosteller, F.  Bush, R.R. (1954, ISBN:0201048523) and Lancaster
		HO (1949, ISSN:00063444)), but also new method named weighted
		Fishers method we developed. While the (weighted) Z-method is
		suitable for finding features effective in most experiments,
		(weighted) Fishers method is useful for detecting partially
		associated features. Thus, the users can choose the function
		based on their purpose. Yoon et al. (2021) "Powerful p-value
		combination methods to detect incomplete association"
