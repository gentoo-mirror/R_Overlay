		Boundary Overlap Statistics // Analysis workflow for finding
		geographic boundaries of ecological or landscape traits and
		comparing the placement of geographic boundaries of two traits.
		If data are trait values, trait data are transformed to
		boundary intensities based on approximate first derivatives
		across latitude and longitude. The package includes functions
		to create custom null models based on the input data. The
		boundary statistics are described in: Fortin, Drapeau, and
		Jacquez (1996) doi:10.2307/3545584.
