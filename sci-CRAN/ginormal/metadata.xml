		Generalized Inverse Normal Distribution Density and Generation //
		Density function and generation of random variables from the
		Generalized Inverse Normal (GIN) distribution from Robert
		(1991) doi:10.1016/0167-7152(91)90174-P. Also provides density
		functions and generation from the GIN distribution truncated to
		positive or negative reals. Theoretical guarantees supporting
		the sampling algorithms and an application to Bayesian
		estimation of network formation models can be found in the
		working paper Ding, Estrada and Montoya-Blandn (2023) https://w
