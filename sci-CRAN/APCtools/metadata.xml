		Routines for Descriptive and Model-Based APC Analysis // Age-
		Period-Cohort (APC) analyses are used to differentiate relevant
		drivers for long-term developments. The 'APCtools' package
		offers visualization techniques and general routines to
		simplify the workflow of an APC analysis. Sophisticated
		functions are available both for descriptive and regression
		model-based analyses. For the former, we use density (or
		ridgeline) matrices and (hexagonally binned) heatmaps as
		innovative visualization techniques building on the concept of
		Lexis diagrams. Model-based analyses build on the separation of
		the temporal dimensions based on generalized additive models,
		where a tensor product interaction surface (usually between age
		and period) is utilized to represent the third dimension
		(usually cohort) on its diagonal. Such tensor product surfaces
		can also be estimated while accounting for further covariates
		in the regression model. See Weigert et al. (2021)
