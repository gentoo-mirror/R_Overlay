		Local Interpretable (Model-Agnostic) Visual Explanations //
		Interpretability of complex machine learning models is a
		growing concern. This package helps to understand key factors
		that drive the decision made by complicated predictive model
		(so called black box model). This is achieved through local
		approximations that are either based on additive regression
		like model or CART like model that allows for higher
		interactions. The methodology is based on Tulio Ribeiro, Singh,
		Guestrin (2016) doi:10.1145/2939672.2939778. More details can
		be found in Staniak, Biecek (2018) arXiv:1804.01955.
