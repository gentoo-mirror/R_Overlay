		Flow Map Rendering // Create interactive flow maps using
		'FlowmapBlue' 'TypeScript' library
		https://github.com/FlowmapBlue/FlowmapBlue, which is a free
		tool for representing aggregated numbers of movements between
		geographic locations as flow maps. It is used to visualize
		urban mobility, commuting behavior, bus, subway and air
		travels, bicycle sharing, human and bird migration, refugee
		flows, freight transportation, trade, supply chains, scientific
		collaboration, epidemiological and historical data and many
		other topics. The package allows to either create standalone
		flow maps in form of 'htmlwidgets' and save them in 'HTML'
		files, or integrate flow maps into 'Shiny' applications.
