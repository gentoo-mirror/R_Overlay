		Two Event Mark-Recapture Experiment // Tools are provided for
		estimating, testing, and simulating abundance in a two-event
		(Petersen) mark-recapture experiment. Functions are given to
		calculate the Petersen, Chapman, and Bailey estimators and
		associated variances. However, the principal utility is a set
		of functions to simulate random draws from these estimators,
		and use these to conduct hypothesis tests and power
		calculations. Additionally, a set of functions are provided for
		generating confidence intervals via bootstrapping. Functions
		are also provided to test abundance estimator consistency under
		complete or partial stratification, and to calculate stratified
		or partially stratified estimators. Functions are also provided
		to calculate recommended sample sizes. Referenced methods can
		be found in Arnason et al. (1996) ISSN:0706-6457, Bailey (1951)
