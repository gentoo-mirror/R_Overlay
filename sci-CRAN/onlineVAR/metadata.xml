		Online Fitting of Time-Adaptive Lasso Vector Auto Regression //
		Functions for recursive online fitting of time-adaptive lasso
		vector auto regression. A recursive coordinate descent
		algorithm is used to estimate sparse vector auto regressive
		models and exponential forgetting is applied to allow model
		changes. Details can be found in Jakob W. Messner and Pierre
		Pinson (2018). "Online adaptive LASSO estimation in Vector Auto
		Regressive models for wind power forecasting in high
		dimension". International Journal of Forecasting, in press.
