		Genetic Algorithms and C-Steps Based LTS (Least Trimmed Squares)
		Estimation // Includes the ga.lts() function that estimates LTS
		(Least Trimmed Squares) parameters using genetic algorithms and
		C-steps. ga.lts() constructs a genetic algorithm to form a
		basic subset and iterates C-steps as defined in Rousseeuw and
		van-Driessen (2006) to calculate the cost value of the LTS
		criterion. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression is known to
		be sensitive to outliers. A single outlying observation can
		change the values of estimated parameters. LTS is a resistant
		estimator even the number of outliers is up to half of the
		data. This package is for estimating the LTS parameters with
		lower bias and variance in a reasonable time. Version =1.3
		includes the function medmad for fast outlier detection in
		linear regression.
