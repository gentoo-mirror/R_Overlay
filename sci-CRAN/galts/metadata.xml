		Genetic algorithms and C-steps based LTS (Least Trimmed Squares)
		estimation // This package includes the ga.lts function that
		estimates LTS (Least Trimmed Squares) parameters using genetic
		algorithms and C-steps. ga.lts() constructs a genetic algorithm
		to form a basic subset and iterates C-steps as defined in
		Rousseeuw and van-Driessen (2006) to calculate the cost value
		of the LTS criterion. OLS(Ordinary Least Squares) regression is
		known to be sensitive to outliers. A single outlying
		observation can change the values of estimated parameters. LTS
		is a resistant estimator even the number of outliers is up to
		half of the data. This package is for estimating the LTS
		parameters with lower bias and variance in a reasonable time.
		Version 1.3 included the function medmad for fast outlier
		detection in linear regression.
