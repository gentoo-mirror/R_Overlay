		Sparse Online Principal Component for TFM // The Truncated Factor
		Model is a statistical model designed to handle specific data
		structures in data analysis. This R package focuses on the
		Sparse Online Principal Component Estimation method, which is
		used to calculate data such as the loading matrix and specific
		variance matrix for truncated data, thereby better explaining
		the relationship between common factors and original variables.
		Additionally, the R package also provides other equations for
		comparison with the Sparse Online Principal Component
		Estimation method.The philosophy of the package is described in
		Guangbao Guo. (2023) doi:10.1007/s00180-022-01270-z.
