		Reference Analysis for Bayesian Meta-Analysis // Functionality
		for performing a principled reference analysis in the Bayesian
		normal-normal hierarchical model used for Bayesian meta-
		analysis, as described in Ott, Plummer and Roos (2021, "How
		vague is vague? How informative is informative? Reference
		analysis for Bayesian meta-analysis", under minor revision for
		Statistics in Medicine). Computes a reference posterior,
		induced by a minimally informative improper reference prior for
		the between-study (heterogeneity) standard deviation.
		Determines additional proper anti-conservative (and
		conservative) prior benchmarks. Includes functions for
		reference analyses at both the posterior and the prior level,
		which, given the data, quantify the informativeness of a
		heterogeneity prior of interest relative to the minimally
		informative reference prior and the proper prior benchmarks.
		The functions operate on data sets which are compatible with
		the 'bayesmeta' package.
