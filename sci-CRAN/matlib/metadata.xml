		Matrix Functions for Teaching and Learning Linear Algebra and
		Multivariate Statistics // A collection of matrix functions for
		teaching and learning matrix linear algebra as used in
		multivariate statistical methods. Many of these functions are
		designed for tutorial purposes in learning matrix algebra ideas
		using R. In some cases, functions are provided for concepts
		available elsewhere in R, but where the function call or name
		is not obvious. In other cases, functions are provided to show
		or demonstrate an algorithm. In addition, a collection of
		functions are provided for drawing vector diagrams in 2D and 3D
		and for rendering matrix expressions and equations in LaTeX.
