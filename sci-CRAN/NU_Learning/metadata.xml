		Nonparametric and Unsupervised Learning from Cross-Sectional
		Observational Data // Especially when cross-sectional data are
		observational, effects of treatment selection bias and
		confounding are best revealed by using Nonparametric and
		Unsupervised methods to "Design" the analysis of the given data
		...rather than the collection of "designed data". Specifically,
		the "effect-size distribution" that best quantifies a
		potentially causal relationship between a numeric y-Outcome
		variable and either a binary t-Treatment or continuous
		e-Exposure variable needs to consist of BLOCKS of relatively
		well-matched experimental units (e.g. patients) that have the
		most similar X-confounder characteristics. Since our NU
		Learning approach will form BLOCKS by "clustering" experimental
		units in confounder X-space, the implicit statistical model for
		learning is One-Way ANOVA. Within Block measures of effect-size
		are then either [a] LOCAL Treatment Differences (LTDs) between
		Within-Cluster y-Outcome Means ("new" minus "control") when
		treatment choice is Binary or else [b] LOCAL Rank Correlations
		(LRCs) when the e-Exposure variable is numeric with (hopefully
		many) more than two levels. An Instrumental Variable (IV)
		method is also provided so that Local Average y-Outcomes (LAOs)
		within BLOCKS may also contribute information for effect-size
		inferences when X-Covariates are assumed to influence Treatment
		choice or Exposure level but otherwise have no direct effects
		on y-Outcomes. Finally, a "Most-Like-Me" function provides
		histograms of effect-size distributions to aid Doctor-Patient
		(or Researcher-Society) communications about Heterogeneous
		Outcomes. Obenchain and Young (2013)
