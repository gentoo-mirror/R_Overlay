		Simplification of Surface Triangular Meshes with Associated
		Distributed Data // Iterative simplification strategy for
		surface triangular meshes (2.5D meshes) with associated data.
		Each iteration corresponds to an edge collapse where the
		selection of the edge to contract is driven by a cost
		functional that depends both on the geometry of the mesh than
		on the distribution of the data locations over the mesh. The
		library can handle both zero and higher genus surfaces. The
		package has been designed to be fully compatible with the R
		package 'fdaPDE', which implements regression models with
		partial differential regularizations, making use of the Finite
		Element Method. In the future, the functionalities provided by
		the current package may be directly integrated into 'fdaPDE'.
