		Equipment for Logarithmic and Linear Time Stepwise Multiple
		Hypothesis Testing // Recently many new p-value based multiple
		test procedures have been proposed, and these new methods are
		more powerful than the widely used Hochberg procedure. These
		procedures strongly control the familywise error rate (FWER).
		This is a comprehensive collection of p-value based FWER-
		control stepwise multiple test procedures, including six
		procedure families and thirty multiple test procedures. In this
		collection, the conservative Hochberg procedure, linear time
		Hommel procedures, asymptotic Rom procedure, Gou-Tamhane-Xi-Rom
		procedures, and Quick procedures are all developed in recent
		five years since 2014. The package name "elitism" is an acronym
		of "e"quipment for "l"ogarithmic and l"i"near "ti"me "s"tepwise
		"m"ultiple hypothesis testing. See Gou, J. (2022), "Quick
		multiple test procedures and p-value adjustments", Statistics
		in Biopharmaceutical Research 14(4), 636-650.
