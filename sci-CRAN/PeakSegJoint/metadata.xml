		Joint Peak Detection in Several ChIP-Seq Samples // Jointly
		segment several ChIP-seq samples to find the peaks which are
		the same and different across samples. The fast approximate
		maximum Poisson likelihood algorithm is described in
		"PeakSegJoint: fast supervised peak detection via joint
		segmentation of multiple count data samples" arXiv:1506.01286
		by TD Hocking and G Bourque.
