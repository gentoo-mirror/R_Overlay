		Tools for Outbreak Investigation/Infectious Disease Surveillance
		// Create epicurves, epigantt charts, and diverging bar charts
		using 'ggplot2'. Prepare data for visualisation or other
		reporting for infectious disease surveillance and outbreak
		investigation (time series data).  Includes tidy functions to
		solve date based transformations for common reporting tasks,
		like (A) seasonal date alignment for respiratory disease
		surveillance, (B) date-based case binning based on specified
		time intervals like isoweek, epiweek, month and more, (C)
		automated detection and marking of the new year based on the
		date/datetime axis of the 'ggplot2', (D) labelling of the last
		value of a time-series.  An introduction on how to use
		epicurves can be found on the US CDC website (2012,
		https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/epimode/index.html).
