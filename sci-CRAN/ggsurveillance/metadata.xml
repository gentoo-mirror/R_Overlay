		Tools and 'ggplot2' Extensions for Infectious Disease
		Surveillance and Outbreak Investigation // Create epicurves or
		epigantt charts in 'ggplot2'. Prepare data for visualisation or
		other reporting for infectious disease surveillance and
		outbreak investigation.  Includes functions to solve date based
		transformations for common reporting tasks, like (A) seasonal
		date alignment for respiratory disease surveillance, (B) date-
		based case binning based on specified time intervals like
		isoweek, epiweek, month and more, (C) automated detection and
		marking of the new year based on the date/datetime axis of the
		'ggplot2'. An introduction on how to use epicurves can be found
		on the US CDC website (2012,
		https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/epimode/index.html).
