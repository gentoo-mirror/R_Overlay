		Fractional Weighted Bootstrap // An implementation of the
		fractional weighted bootstrap to be used as a drop-in for
		functions in the 'boot' package. The fractional weighted
		bootstrap (also known as the Bayesian bootstrap) involves
		drawing weights randomly that are applied to the data rather
		than resampling units from the data. See Xu et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2020.1731599 for details.
