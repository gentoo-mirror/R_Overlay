		Extending 'mlr3' to Functional Data Analysis // Extends the
		'mlr3' ecosystem to functional analysis by adding support for
		irregular and regular functional data as defined in the 'tf'
		package. The package provides 'PipeOps' for preprocessing
		functional columns and for extracting scalar features, thereby
		allowing standard machine learning algorithms to be applied
		afterwards. Available operations include simple functional
		features such as the mean or maximum, smoothing, interpolation,
		flattening, and functional 'PCA'.
