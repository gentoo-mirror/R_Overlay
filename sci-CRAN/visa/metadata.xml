		Vegetation Imaging Spectroscopy Analyzer // Provides easy-to-use
		tools for data analysis and visualization for hyperspectral
		remote sensing (also known as imaging spectroscopy), with a
		particular focus on vegetation hyperspectral data analysis. It
		consists of a set of functions, ranging from the organization
		of hyperspectral data in the proper data structure for spectral
		feature selection, calculation of vegetation index,
		multivariate analysis, as well as to the visualization of
		spectra and results of analysis in the 'ggplot2' style.
