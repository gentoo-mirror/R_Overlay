		Common Base-R Problems Relating to Lists // Utility functions
		that help with common base-R problems relating to lists. Lists
		in base-R are very flexible. This package provides functions to
		quickly and easily characterize types of lists. That is, to
		identify if all elements in a list are null, data.frames,
		lists, or fully named lists. Other functionality is provided
		for the handling of lists, such as the easy splitting of lists
		into equally sized groups, and the unnesting of data.frames
		within fully named lists.
