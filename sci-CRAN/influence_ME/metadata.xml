		Tools for Detecting Influential Data in Mixed Effects Models //
		Provides a collection of tools for detecting influential cases
		in generalized mixed effects models. It analyses models that
		were estimated using 'lme4'. The basic rationale behind
		identifying influential data is that when iteratively single
		units are omitted from the data, models based on these data
		should not produce substantially different estimates. To
		standardize the assessment of how influential a (single group
		of) observation(s) is, several measures of influence are common
		practice, such as DFBETAS and Cook's Distance. In addition, we
		provide a measure of percentage change of the fixed point
		estimates and a simple procedure to detect changing levels of
		significance.
