		Tools for Detecting Influential Data in Mixed Effects Models //
		Provides a collection of tools for detecting influential cases
		in generalized mixed effects models. It analyses models that
		were estimated using 'lme4'. The basic rationale behind
		identifying influential data is that when single units are
		omitted from the data, models based on these data should not
		produce substantially different estimates. To standardize the
		assessment of how influential a (single group of)
		observation(s) is, several measures of influence are common
		practice, such as Cook's Distance. In addition, we provide a
		measure of percentage change of the fixed point estimates and a
		simple procedure to detect changing levels of significance.
