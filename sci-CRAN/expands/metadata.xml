		Expanding Ploidy and Allele-Frequency on Nested Subpopulations //
		Expanding Ploidy and Allele Frequency on Nested Subpopulations
		(expands) characterizes coexisting subpopulations in a single
		tumor sample using copy number and allele frequencies derived
		from exome- or whole genome sequencing input data
		(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24177718). The model
		detects coexisting genotypes by leveraging run-specific
		tradeoffs between depth of coverage and breadth of coverage.
		This package predicts the number of clonal expansions, the size
		of the resulting subpopulations in the tumor bulk, the
		mutations specific to each subpopulation, tumor purity and
		phylogeny. The main function runExPANdS() provides the complete
		functionality needed to predict coexisting subpopulations from
		single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and associated copy
		numbers.  The robustness of subpopulation predictions increases
		with the number of mutations provided. It is recommended that
		at least 200 mutations are used as input to obtain stable
		results. Updates in version 2.1 include: (i) new parameter
		ploidy in runExPANdS.R allows specification of non-diploid
		background ploidies (e.g. for near-triploid cell lines); (ii)
		parallel computing option is available. Further documentation
		and FAQ available at http://dna-
		discovery.stanford.edu/software/expands.
