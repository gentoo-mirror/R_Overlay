		Constrained, Covariance-Matching Constrained and Universal Point
		or Block Kriging // Provides functions for efficient
		computation of non-linear spatial predictions with local change
		of support (Hofer, C. and Papritz, A. (2011)
		"constrainedKriging: An R-package for customary, constrained
		and covariance-matching constrained point or block kriging"
		doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2011.02.009).  This package supplies
		functions for two-dimensional spatial interpolation by
		constrained (Cressie, N. (1993) "Aggregation in geostatistical
		problems" doi:10.1007/978-94-011-1739-5_3), covariance-matching
		constrained (Aldworth, J. and Cressie, N. (2003) "Prediction of
		nonlinear spatial functionals"
		doi:10.1016/S0378-3758(02)00321-X) and universal (external
		drift) Kriging for points or blocks of any shape from data with
		a non-stationary mean function and an isotropic weakly
		stationary covariance function.  The linear spatial
		interpolation methods, constrained and covariance-matching
		constrained Kriging, provide approximately unbiased prediction
		for non-linear target values under change of support.  This
		package extends the range of tools for spatial predictions
		available in R and provides an alternative to conditional
		simulation for non-linear spatial prediction problems with
		local change of support.
