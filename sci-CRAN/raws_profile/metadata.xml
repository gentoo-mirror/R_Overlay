		Managing Profiles on Amazon Web Service // This is an R wrapper
		from the AWS Command Line Interface that provides methods to
		manage the user configuration on Amazon Web Service. You can
		create as many profiles as you want, manage them, and delete
		them. The profiles created with this tool work with all AWS
		products such as S3, Glacier, and EC2. It also provides a
		function to automatically install AWS CLI, but you can download
		it and install it manually if you prefer.
