		Chi-Square and Exact Tests for Model-Free Functional Dependency
		// Statistical hypothesis testing methods for model-free
		functional dependency using asymptotic chi-square or exact
		distributions. Functional chi-squares are asymmetric and
		functionally optimal, unique from other related statistics.
		Tests in this package reveal evidence for causality based on
		the causality-by-functionality principle. They include
		asymptotic functional chi-square tests, an exact functional
		test, a comparative functional chi-square test, and also a
		comparative chi-square test. The normalized non-constant
		functional chi-square test was used by Best Performer
		NMSUSongLab in HPN-DREAM (DREAM8) Breast Cancer Network
		Inference Challenges. A function index derived from the
		functional chi-square offers a new effect size measure for the
		strength of function dependency, a better alternative to
		conditional entropy in many aspects. For continuous data, these
		tests offer an advantage over regression analysis when a
		parametric functional form cannot be assumed; for categorical
		data, they provide a novel means to assess directional
		dependency not possible with symmetrical Pearson's chi-square
		or Fisher's exact tests.
