		Model-Free Functional Chi-Squared and Exact Tests // Statistical
		hypothesis testing methods for inferring model-free functional
		dependency using asymptotic chi-squared or exact distributions.
		Functional test statistics are asymmetric and functionally
		optimal, unique from other related statistics. Tests in this
		package reveal evidence for causality based on the causality-
		by-functionality principle. They include asymptotic functional
		chi-squared tests (Zhang  Song 2013) arXiv:1311.2707 and an
		exact functional test (Zhong  Song 2019)
		doi:10.1109/TCBB.2018.2809743. The normalized functional chi-
		squared test was used by Best Performer 'NMSUSongLab' in HPN-
		DREAM (DREAM8) Breast Cancer Network Inference Challenges (Hill
		et al 2016) doi:10.1038/nmeth.3773. A function index (Zhong
		Song 2019) doi:10.1186/s12920-019-0565-9 (Kumar et al 2018)
		doi:10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621502 derived from the functional test
		statistic offers a new effect size measure for the strength of
		functional dependency, a better alternative to conditional
		entropy in many aspects. For continuous data, these tests offer
		an advantage over regression analysis when a parametric
		functional form cannot be assumed; for categorical data, they
		provide a novel means to assess directional dependency not
		possible with symmetrical Pearson's chi-squared or Fisher's
		exact tests.
