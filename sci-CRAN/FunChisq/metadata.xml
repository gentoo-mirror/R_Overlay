		Chi-Square and Exact Tests for Non-Parametric Functional
		Dependencies // Statistical hypothesis testing methods for non-
		parametric functional dependencies using asymptotic chi-square
		or exact statistics. Functional chi-squares are asymmetric and
		functional optimal, unique from other related statistics. These
		tests reveal evidence for causality based on the causality-by-
		functionality principle. They include asymptotic functional
		chi-square tests, an exact functional test, a comparative
		functional chi-square test, and also a comparative chi-square
		test. The normalized non-constant functional chi-square test
		was used by Best Performer NMSUSongLab in HPN-DREAM (DREAM8)
		Breast Cancer Network Inference Challenges. For continuous
		data, these tests offer an advantage over regression analysis
		when a parametric functional form cannot be assumed; for
		categorical data, they provide a novel means to assess
		directional dependencies not possible with symmetrical
		Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.
