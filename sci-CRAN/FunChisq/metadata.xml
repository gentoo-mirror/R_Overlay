		Chi-Square and Exact Tests for Non-Parametric Functional
		Dependencies // Statistical hypothesis testing methods for non-
		parametric functional dependencies using asymptotic chi-square
		or exact statistics. These tests were motivated to reveal
		evidence for causality based on functional dependencies. They
		include asymptotic functional chi-square tests, an exact
		functional test, a comparative functional chi-square test, and
		also a comparative chi-square test. The normalized non-constant
		functional chi-square test was used by Best Performer
		NMSUSongLab in HPN-DREAM (DREAM8) Breast Cancer Network
		Inference Challenges. For continuous data, these tests offer an
		advantage over regression analysis when a parametric functional
		form cannot be assumed; for categorical data, they provide a
		novel means to assess directional dependencies not possible
		with symmetrical Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.
