		ROC Based Classification // Functions for a classification method
		based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Briefly,
		features are selected according to their ranked AUC value in
		the training set. The selected features are merged by the mean
		value to form a meta-gene. The samples are ranked by their
		meta-gene value and the meta-gene threshold that has the
		highest accuracy in splitting the training samples is
		determined. A new sample is classified by its meta-gene value
		relative to the threshold. In the first place, the package is
		aimed at two class problems in gene expression data, but might
		also apply to other problems.
