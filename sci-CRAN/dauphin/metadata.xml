		Compact Standard for Australian Phone Numbers // Phone numbers
		are often represented as strings because there is no obvious
		and suitable native representation for them.  This leads to
		high memory use and a lack of standard representation.  The
		package provides integer representation of Australian phone
		numbers with optional raw vector calling code. The package name
		is an extension of 'au' and 'ph'.
