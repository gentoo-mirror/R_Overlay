		Translates a R Function into an External Pointer to a C++
		Function // Enable translation of a tiny subset of R to C++.
		The user has to define a R function which gets translated. For
		a full list of possible functions check the documentation.
		After translation an external pointer to the C++ function is
		returned to the user. The intention of the package is to
		generate fast functions which can be used as ode-system or
		during optimization.
