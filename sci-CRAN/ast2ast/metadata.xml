		Translates an R Function to a C++ Function // Enable translation
		of a tiny subset of R to C++. The user has to define a R
		function which gets translated. For a full list of possible
		functions check the documentation. After translation an R
		function is returned which is a shallow wrapper around the C++
		code. Alternatively an external pointer to the C++ function is
		returned to the user. The intention of the package is to
		generate fast functions which can be used as ode-system or
		during optimization.
