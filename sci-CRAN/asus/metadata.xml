		Adaptive SURE Thresholding Using Side Information // Provides the
		ASUS procedure for estimating a high dimensional sparse
		parameter in the presence of auxiliary data that encode side
		information on sparsity. It is a robust data combination
		procedure in the sense that even when pooling non-informative
		auxiliary data ASUS would be at least as efficient as competing
		soft thresholding based methods that do not use auxiliary data.
		For more information, please see the website http://www-
		bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/Papers/ASUS.htm and the accompanying
		paper.
