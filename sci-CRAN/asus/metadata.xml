		Adaptive SURE Thresholding Using Side Information // Provides the
		ASUS procedure for estimating a high dimensional sparse
		parameter in the presence of auxiliary data that encode side
		information on sparsity. It is a robust data combination
		procedure in the sense that even when pooling non-informative
		auxiliary data ASUS would be at least as efficient as competing
		soft thresholding based methods that do not use auxiliary data.
		For more information, please see the paper Adaptive Sparse
		Estimation with Side Information by Banerjee, Mukherjee and Sun
		(JASA 2020).
