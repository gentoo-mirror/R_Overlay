		Scrapes the 'NHL' API for Statistical Analysis // Add game events
		to a database file to use for statistical analysis of hockey
		games. This means we only call the 'NHL' API once for each game
		we want to add. We will have very fast retrieval of data once
		games have been added since the data is stored locally. We use
		the API located at https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams
		with supplemental data from https://www.nhl.com/scores/. Other
		endpoints can be found at https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi.
