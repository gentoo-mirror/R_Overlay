		Cluster Analysis with Missing Values by Multiple Imputation //
		Allows clustering of incomplete observations by addressing
		missing values using multiple imputation. For achieving this
		goal, the methodology consists in three steps, following
		Audigier and Niang 2022 doi:10.1007/s11634-022-00519-1. I)
		Missing data imputation using dedicated models. Four multiple
		imputation methods are proposed, two are based on joint
		modelling and two are fully sequential methods, as discussed in
		Audigier et al. (2021) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2106.04424. II)
		cluster analysis of imputed data sets. Six clustering methods
		are available (distances-based or model-based), but custom
		methods can also be easily used. III) Partition pooling. The
		set of partitions is aggregated using Non-negative Matrix
		Factorization based method. An associated instability measure
		is computed by bootstrap (see Fang, Y. and Wang, J., 2012
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2011.09.003). Among applications, this
		instability measure can be used to choose a number of clusters
		with missing values. The package also proposes several
		diagnostic tools to tune the number of imputed data sets, to
		tune the number of iterations in fully sequential imputation,
		to check the fit of imputation models, etc.
