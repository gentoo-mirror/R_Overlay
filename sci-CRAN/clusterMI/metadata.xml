		Cluster Analysis with Missing Values by Multiple Imputation //
		Allows clustering of incomplete observations by addressing
		missing values using multiple imputation. For achieving this
		goal, the methodology consists in three steps. I) Missing data
		imputation using dedicated models. Four multiple imputation
		methods are proposed, two are based on joint modelling and two
		are fully sequential methods. II) cluster analysis of imputed
		data sets. Six clustering methods are available (distances-
		based or model-based), but custom methods can also be easily
		used. III) Partition pooling, The set of partitions is
		aggregated using Non-negative Matrix Factorization based
		method. An associated instability measure is computed by
		bootstrap. Among applications, this instability measure can be
		used to choose a number of clusters with missing values. The
		package also proposes several diagnostic tools to tune the
		number of imputed data sets, to tune the number of iterations
		in fully sequential imputation, to check the fit of imputation
		models, etc.
