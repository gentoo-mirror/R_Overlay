		Time Series Analysis Tools // A system contains easy-to-use tools
		as a support for time series analysis courses. In particular,
		it incorporates a technique called Generalized Method of
		Wavelet Moments (GMWM) as well as its robust implementation for
		fast and robust parameter estimation of time series models
		which is described, for example, in Guerrier et al. (2013) doi:
		10.1080/01621459.2013.799920. More details can also be found in
