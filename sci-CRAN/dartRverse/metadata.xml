		Install and Load the 'dartRverse' Suits of Packages // Provides a
		single function that supports the installation of all packages
		belonging to the 'dartRverse'. The 'dartRverse' is a set of
		packages that work together to analyse SNP (single nuclear
		polymorphism) data. All packages aim to have a similar 'look
		and feel' and are based on the same type of data structure
		('genlight'), with additional metadata for loci and individuals
		(samples). For more information visit the 'GitHub' pages
		https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/dartRverse.
