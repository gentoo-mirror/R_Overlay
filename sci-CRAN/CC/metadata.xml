		Control Charts // Tools for creating and visualizing statistical
		process control charts. Control charts are used for monitoring
		measurement processes, such as those occurring in
		manufacturing.  The objective is to monitor the history of such
		processes and flag outlying measurements: out-of-control
		signals.  Montgomery, D. (2009, ISBN:978-0-470-16992-6)
		contains an extensive discussion of the methodology.
