		Hyphenation and Syllable Counting for Text Analysis // Provides
		the hyphenation algorithm used for 'TeX'/'LaTeX' and similar
		software, as proposed by Liang (1983,
		https://tug.org/docs/liang/). Mainly contains the function
		hyphen() to be used for hyphenation/syllable counting of text
		objects. It was originally developed for and part of the
		'koRpus' package, but later released as a separate package so
		it's lighter to have this particular functionality available
		for other packages. Support for various languages needs be
		added on-the-fly or by plugin packages
		(https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos); this package does not
		include any language specific data. Due to some restrictions on
		CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the
		project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, request
		features, or discuss the development of the package, please
		subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list
		(http://korpusml.reaktanz.de).
