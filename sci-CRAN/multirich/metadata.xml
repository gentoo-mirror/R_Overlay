		Calculate Multivariate Richness via UTC and sUTC // Functions to
		calculate Unique Trait Combinations (UTC) and scaled Unique
		Trait Combinations (sUTC) as measures of multivariate richness.
		The package can also calculate beta-diversity for trait
		richness and can partition this into nestedness-related and
		turnover components. The code will also calculate several
		measures of overlap. See Keyel and Wiegand (2016)
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12558 for more details.
