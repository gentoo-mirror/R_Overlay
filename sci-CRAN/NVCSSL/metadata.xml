		Nonparametric Varying Coefficient Spike-and-Slab Lasso // EM
		algorithm for fitting Bayesian varying coefficient models with
		the nonparametric varying coefficient spike-and-slab lasso of
		Bai et al. (2020) arXiv:1907.06477. Also fits penalized
		frequentist varying coefficient models with the group lasso,
		group smoothly clipped absolute deviation, and group minimax
		concave penalty.
