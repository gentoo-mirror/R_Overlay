		Prioritize Variables with Joint Variable Importance Plot in
		Observational Study Design // In the observational study design
		stage, matching/weighting methods are conducted. However, when
		many background variables are present, the decision as to which
		variables to prioritize for matching/weighting is not trivial.
		Thus, the joint treatment-outcome variable importance plots are
		created to guide variable selection. The joint variable
		importance plots enhance variable comparisons via unadjusted
		bias curves derived under the omitted variable bias framework.
		The plots translate variable importance into recommended values
		for tuning parameters in existing methods. Post-matching and/or
		weighting plots can also be used to visualize and assess the
		quality of the observational study design. The method
		motivation and derivation is presented in "Using Joint Variable
		Importance Plots to Prioritize Variables in Assessing the
		Impact of Glyburide on Adverse Birth Outcomes" by Liao et al.
		(2023) arXiv:2301.09754. See the package paper by Liao and
		Pimentel (2023) arxiv:2302.10367 for a beginner friendly user
		introduction.
