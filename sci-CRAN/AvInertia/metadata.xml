		Calculate the Inertial Properties of a Flying Bird // Tools to
		compute the center of gravity and moment of inertia tensor of
		any flying bird. The tools function by modeling a bird as a
		composite structure of simple geometric objects. This requires
		detailed morphological measurements of bird specimens although
		those obtained for the associated paper have been included in
		the package for use. Refer to the vignettes and supplementary
		material for detailed information on the package function.
