		Exponential Random Partition Models // Simulates and estimates
		the Exponential Random Partition Model presented in the paper
		Hoffman, Block, and Snijders (2023)
		doi:10.1177/00811750221145166. It can also be used to estimate
		longitudinal partitions, following the model proposed in
		Hoffman and Chabot (2023) doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2023.04.002. The
		model is an exponential family distribution on the space of
		partitions (sets of non-overlapping groups) and is called in
		reference to the Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) for
		networks.
