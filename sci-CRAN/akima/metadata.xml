		Interpolation of Irregularly and Regularly Spaced Data // Several
		cubic spline interpolation methods of H. Akima for irregular
		and regular gridded data are available through this package,
		both for the bivariate case (irregular data: ACM 761, regular
		data: ACM 760) and univariate case (ACM 433 and ACM 697).
		Linear interpolation of irregular gridded data is also covered
		by reusing D. J. Renkas triangulation code which is part of
		Akimas Fortran code. A bilinear interpolator for regular grids
		was also added for comparison with the bicubic interpolator on
		regular grids.
