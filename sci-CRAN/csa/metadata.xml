		A Cross-Scale Analysis Tool for Model-Observation Visualization
		and Integration // Integration of Earth system data from
		various sources is a challenging task. Except for their
		qualitative heterogeneity, different data records exist for
		describing similar Earth system process at different spatio-
		temporal scales. Data inter-comparison and validation are
		usually performed at a single spatial or temporal scale, which
		could hamper the identification of potential discrepancies in
		other scales. 'csa' package offers a simple, yet efficient,
		graphical method for synthesizing and comparing observed and
		modelled data across a range of spatio-temporal scales. Instead
		of focusing at specific scales, such as annual means or
		original grid resolution, we examine how their statistical
		properties change across spatio-temporal continuum.
