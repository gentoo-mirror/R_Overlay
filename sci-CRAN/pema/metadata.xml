		Penalized Meta-Analysis // Conduct penalized meta-analysis, see
		Van Lissa, Van Erp,  Clapper (2023) doi:10.31234/osf.io/6phs5.
		In meta-analysis, there are often between-study differences.
		These can be coded as moderator variables, and controlled for
		using meta-regression. However, if the number of moderators is
		large relative to the number of studies, such an analysis may
		be overfit. Penalized meta-regression is useful in these cases,
		because it shrinks the regression slopes of irrelevant
		moderators towards zero.
