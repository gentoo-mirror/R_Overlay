		Methods for ''A Fast Alternative for the R x C Ecological
		Inference Case'' // Estimates the probability matrix for the RC
		Ecological Inference problem using the Expectation-Maximization
		Algorithm with four approximation methods for the E-Step, and
		an exact method as well. It also provides a bootstrap function
		to estimate the standard deviation of the estimated
		probabilities. In addition, it has functions that aggregate
		rows optimally to have more reliable estimates in cases of
		having few data points. For comparing the probability estimates
		of two groups, a Wald test routine is implemented. The library
		has data from the first round of the Chilean Presidential
		Election 2021 and can also generate synthetic election data.
		Methods described in Thraves, Charles; Ubilla, Pablo;
		Hermosilla, Daniel (2024) ''A Fast Ecological Inference
		Algorithm for the RC case'' doi:10.2139/ssrn.4832834.
