		Read and Write FWF Files in the 'Blaise' Format // Can be used to
		read and write a fwf with an accompanying 'Blaise' datamodel.
		Blaise is the software suite built by Statistics Netherlands
		(CBS). It is essentially a way to write and collect surveys and
		perform statistical analysis on the data. It stores its data in
		fixed width format with an accompanying metadata file, this is
		the Blaise format. The package automatically interprets this
		metadata and reads the file into an R dataframe. When supplying
		a datamodel for writing, the dataframe will be automatically
		converted to that format and checked for compatibility.
		Supports dataframes, tibbles and LaF objects. For more
		information about 'Blaise', see
