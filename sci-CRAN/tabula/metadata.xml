		Analysis, Seriation and Visualization of Archaeological Count
		Data // An easy way to examine archaeological count data
		(artifacts, faunal remains, etc.). This package includes
		several measures of diversity: e.g. richness and rarefaction
		(Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.), diversity/dominance and
		evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.), turnover and
		similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, ...). Most of these methods are
		described and discussed in Maguran (1988)
		doi:10.1007/978-94-015-7358-0. It also provides matrix
		seriation methods (reciprocal ranking, CA-based seriation) for
		chronological modeling and dating. The package make it easy to
		visualize count data and statistical thresholds: rank/abundance
		plots, Ford (1972) isbn:0913134082 and Bertin (1977)
		isbn:2082111121 diagrams, etc.
