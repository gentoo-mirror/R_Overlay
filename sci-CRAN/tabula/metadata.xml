		Analysis, Seriation and Visualization of Archaeological Count
		Data // An easy way to examine archaeological count data. This
		package provides a convenient and reproducible toolkit for
		relative dating by matrix seriation (reciprocal ranking, CA-
		based seriation). It also provides several tests and measures
		of diversity: heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon,
		Simpson, etc.), richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE,
		ICE, etc.), turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.).
		The package make it easy to visualize count data and
		statistical thresholds: rank vs abundance plots, heatmaps, Ford
		(1962) and Bertin (1977) diagrams.
