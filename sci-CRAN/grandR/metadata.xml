		Comprehensive Analysis of Nucleotide Conversion Sequencing Data
		// Nucleotide conversion sequencing experiments have been
		developed to add a temporal dimension to RNA-seq and single-
		cell RNA-seq. Such experiments require specialized tools for
		primary processing such as GRAND-SLAM, (see 'Jrges et al'
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty256) and specialized tools for
		downstream analyses. 'grandR' provides a comprehensive toolbox
		for quality control, kinetic modeling, differential gene
		expression analysis and visualization of such data.
