		Implementation of LT-FH++ // Implementation of LT-FH++, an
		extension of the liability threshold family history (LT-FH)
		model. LT-FH++ uses a Gibbs sampler for sampling from the
		truncated multivariate normal distribution and allows for
		flexible family structures. LT-FH++ was first described in
		Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2022)
		https://pure.au.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/353346245/ as an
		extension to LT-FH with more flexible family structures, and
		again as the age-dependent liability threshold (ADuLT) model
		Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2023)
		https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41210-z as an
		alternative to traditional time-to-event genome-wide
		association studies, where family history was not considered.
