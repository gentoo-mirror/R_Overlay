		High Throughput 'GoMiner' // Two papers published in the early
		2000's (Zeeberg, B.R., Feng, W., Wang, G. et al. (2003)
		doi:10.1186/gb-2003-4-4-r28) and (Zeeberg, B.R., Qin, H.,
		Narashimhan, S., et al. (2005) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-6-168)
		implement 'GoMiner' and 'High Throughput GoMiner' ('HTGM') to
		map lists of genes to the Gene Ontology (GO)
		https://geneontology.org. Until recently, these were hosted on
		a server at The National Cancer Institute (NCI). In order to
		continue providing these services to the bio-medical community,
		I have developed stand-alone versions. The current package
		'HTGM' builds upon my recent package 'GoMiner'. The output of
		'GoMiner' is a heatmap showing the relationship of a single
		list of genes and the significant categories into which they
		map. 'High Throughput GoMiner' ('HTGM') integrates the results
		of the individual 'GoMiner' analyses. The output of 'HTGM' is a
		heatmap showing the relationship of the significant categories
		derived from each gene list. The heatmap has only 2 axes, so
		the identity of the genes are unfortunately "integrated out of
		the equation." Because the graphic for the heatmap is
		implemented in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) technology, it is
		relatively easy to hyperlink each picture element to the
		relevant list of genes. By clicking on the desired picture
		element, the user can recover the "lost" genes.
