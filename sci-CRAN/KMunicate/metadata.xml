		KMunicate-Style KaplanMeier Plots // Produce KaplanMeier plots in
		the style recommended following the KMunicate study by Morris
		et al. (2019) doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030215. The KMunicate
		style consists of Kaplan-Meier curves with confidence intervals
		to quantify uncertainty and an extended risk table (per
		treatment arm) depicting the number of study subjects at risk,
		events, and censored observations over time. The resulting
		plots are built using 'ggplot2' and can be further customised
		to a certain extent, including themes, fonts, and colour
		scales.
