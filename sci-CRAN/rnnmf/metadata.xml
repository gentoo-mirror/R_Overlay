		Regularized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization // A proof of
		concept implementation of regularized non-negative matrix
		factorization optimization. A non-negative matrix factorization
		factors non-negative matrix Y approximately as L R, for non-
		negative matrices L and R of reduced rank. This package
		supports such factorizations with weighted objective and
		regularization penalties. Allowable regularization penalties
		include L1 and L2 penalties on L and R, as well as non-
		orthogonality penalties. This package provides multiplicative
		update algorithms, which are a modification of the algorithm of
		Lee and Seung (2001)
		http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1861-algorithms-for-non-negative-
		matrix-factorization.pdf, as well as an additive update derived
		from that multiplicative update.  See also Pav (2004)
