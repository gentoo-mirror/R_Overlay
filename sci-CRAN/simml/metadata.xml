		Single-Index Models with Multiple-Links // A major challenge in
		estimating treatment decision rules from a randomized clinical
		trial dataset with covariates measured at baseline lies in
		detecting relatively small treatment effect modification-
		related variability (i.e., the treatment-by-covariates
		interaction effects on treatment outcomes) against a relatively
		large non-treatment-related variability (i.e., the main effects
		of covariates on treatment outcomes). The class of Single-Index
		Models with Multiple-Links is a novel single-index model
		specifically designed to estimate a single-index (a linear
		combination) of the covariates associated with the treatment
		effect modification-related variability, while allowing a
		nonlinear association with the treatment outcomes via flexible
		link functions. The models provide a flexible regression
		approach to developing treatment decision rules based on
		patients' data measured at baseline. We refer to Park, Petkova,
		Tarpey, and Ogden (2020) doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2019.05.008 and
		Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2020) doi:10.1111/biom.13320
		(that allows an unspecified X main effect) for detail of the
		method. The main function of this package is simml().
