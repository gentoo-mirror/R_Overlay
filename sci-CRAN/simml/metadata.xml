		Single-Index Models with Multiple-Links // A major challenge in
		estimating treatment decision rules from a randomized clinical
		trial dataset with covariates measured at baseline lies in
		detecting relatively small treatment effect modification-
		related variability (i.e., the treatment-by-covariates
		interaction effects on treatment outcomes) against a relatively
		large non-treatment-related variability (i.e., the main effects
		of covariates on treatment outcomes). The class of Single-Index
		Models with Multiple-Links is a novel single-index model
		specifically designed to estimate a single-index (a linear
		combination) of the covariates associated with the treatment
		effect modification-related variability, while allowing a
		nonlinear association with the treatment outcomes via flexible
		link functions. The models provide a flexible regression
		approach to developing treatment decision rules based on
		patients' data measured at baseline. We refer to Petkova,
		Tarpey, Su, and Ogden (2017) doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxw035
		and "A constrained single-index model for estimating
		interactions between a treatment and covariates" (under review,
		2019) for detail. The main function of this package is simml().
