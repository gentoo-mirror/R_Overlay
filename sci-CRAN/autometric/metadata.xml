		Background Resource Logging // Intense parallel workloads can be
		difficult to monitor. Packages 'crew.cluster', 'clustermq', and
		'future.batchtools' distribute hundreds of worker processes
		over multiple computers. If a worker process exhausts its
		available memory, it may terminate silently, leaving the
		underlying problem difficult to detect or troubleshoot. Using
		the 'autometric' package, a worker can proactively monitor
		itself in a detached background thread. The worker process
		itself runs normally, and the thread writes to a log every few
		seconds. If the worker terminates unexpectedly, 'autometric'
		can read and visualize the log file to reveal potential
		resource-related reasons for the crash. The 'autometric'
		package borrows heavily from the methods of packages 'ps'
		doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.ps and 'psutil'.
