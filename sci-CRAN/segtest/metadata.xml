		Tests for Segregation Distortion in Polyploids // Provides tests
		for segregation distortion in F1 polyploid populations under
		different assumptions of meiosis. These tests can account for
		double reduction, partial preferential pairing, and genotype
		uncertainty through the use of genotype likelihoods.
		Parallelization support is provided. Details of these methods
		are described in Gerard et al. (2025a)
		doi:10.1007/s00122-025-04816-z and Gerard et al. (2025b)
		doi:10.1101/2025.06.23.661114. Part of this material is based
		upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under
