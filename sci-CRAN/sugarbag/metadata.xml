		Create Tessellated Hexagon Maps // Create a hexagon tile map
		display from spatial polygons. Each polygon is represented by a
		hexagon tile, placed as close to it's original centroid as
		possible, with a focus on maintaining spatial relationship to a
		focal point. Developed to aid visualisation and analysis of
		spatial distributions across Australia, which can be
		challenging due to the concentration of the population on the
		coast and wide open interior.
