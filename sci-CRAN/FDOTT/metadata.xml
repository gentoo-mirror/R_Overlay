		Optimal Transport Based Testing in Factorial Design // Perform
		optimal transport based tests in factorial designs as
		introduced in Groppe et al. (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2509.13970 via the FDOTT() function. These
		tests are inspired by ANOVA and its nonparametric counterparts.
		They allow for testing linear relationships in factorial
		designs between finitely supported probability measures on a
		metric space. Such relationships include equality of all
		measures (no treatment effect), interaction effects between a
		number of factors, as well as main and simple factor effects.
