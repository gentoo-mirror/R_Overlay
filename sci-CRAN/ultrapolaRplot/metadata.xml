		Plotting Ultrasound Tongue Traces // Plots traced ultrasound
		tongue imaging data according to a polar coordinate system.
		There is currently support for plotting means and standard
		deviations of each category's trace; Smoothing Splines Analysis
		of Variance (SSANOVA) could be implemented as well.  The origin
		of the polar coordinates may be defined manually or
		automatically determined based on different algorithms.
		Currently 'ultrapolaRplot' supports ultrasound tongue imaging
		trace data from 'UltraTrace'
		(https://github.com/SwatPhonLab/UltraTrace). 'UltraTrace' is
		capable of importing data from Articulate Instruments AAA.
		'read_textgrid.R' is required for opening TextGrids to
		determine category and alignment information of ultrasound
		traces.
