		Create Longitudinal Google Trends Data // 'Google Trends'
		provides cross-sectional and time-series data on searches, but
		lacks readily available longitudinal data. Researchers, who
		want to create longitudinal 'Google Trends' on their own, face
		practical challenges, such as normalized counts that make it
		difficult to combine cross-sectional and time-series data and
		limitations in data formats and timelines that limit data
		granularity over extended time periods. This package addresses
		these issues and enables researchers to generate longitudinal
		'Google Trends' data. This package is built on 'pytrends', a
		Python library that acts as the unofficial 'Google Trends API'
		to collect 'Google Trends' data. As long as the 'Google Trends
		API', 'pytrends' and all their dependencies are working, this
		package will work. During testing, we noticed that for the same
		input (keyword, topic, data_format, timeline), the output index
		can vary from time to time. Besides, if the keyword is not very
		popular, then the resulting dataset will contain a lot of
		zeros, which will greatly affect the final result. While this
		package has no control over the accuracy or quality of 'Google
		Trends' data, once the data is created, this package coverts it
		to longitudinal data. In addition, the user may encounter a 429
		Too Many Requests error when using cross_section() and
		time_series() to collect 'Google Trends' data. This error
		indicates that the user has exceeded the rate limits set by the
		'Google Trends API'. For more information about the 'Google
		Trends API' - 'pytrends', visit
		https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/.
