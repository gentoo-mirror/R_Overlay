		Functional Bases // Easy-to-use, very fast implementation of
		various functional bases. Easily used together with other
		packages. A functional basis is a collection of basis functions
		[\phi_1, ..., \phi_n] that can represent a smooth function,
		i.e. $f(t) = \sum c_k \phi_k(t)$. As of version 1.0, this
		package includes B-splines, Fourier bases and polynomials.
