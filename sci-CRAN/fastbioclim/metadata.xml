		Scalable and Efficient Derivation of Bioclimatic Variables //
		Provides a high-performance framework for deriving bioclimatic
		and custom summary variables from large-scale climate raster
		data. The package features a dual-backend architecture that
		intelligently switches between fast in-memory processing for
		smaller datasets (via the 'terra' package) and a memory-safe
		tiled approach for massive datasets that do not fit in RAM (via
		'exactextractr' and 'Rfast'). The main functions,
		'derive_bioclim()' and 'derive_statistics()', offer a unified
		interface with advanced options for custom time periods and
		static indices, making it suitable for a wide range of
		ecological and environmental modeling applications. A software
		note is in preparation. In the meantime, you can visit the
		package website https://gepinillab.github.io/fastbioclim/ to
		find tutorials in English and Spanish.
