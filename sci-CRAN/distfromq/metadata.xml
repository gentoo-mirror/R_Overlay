		Reconstruct a Distribution from a Collection of Quantiles //
		Given a set of predictive quantiles from a distribution,
		estimate the distribution and create `d`, `p`, `q`, and `r`
		functions to evaluate its density function, distribution
		function, and quantile function, and generate random samples.
		On the interior of the provided quantiles, an interpolation
		method such as a monotonic cubic spline is used; the tails are
		approximated by a location-scale family.
