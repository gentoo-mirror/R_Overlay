		Derive Polygenic Risk Score Based on Emprical Bayes Theory // EB-
		PRS is a novel method that leverages information for effect
		sizes across all the markers to improve the prediction
		accuracy.  No parameter tuning is needed in the method, and no
		external information is needed. This R-package provides the
		calculation of polygenic risk scores from the given training
		summary statistics and testing data. We can use EB-PRS to
		extract main information, estimate Empirical Bayes parameters,
		derive polygenic risk scores for  each individual in testing
		data, and evaluate the PRS according to AUC and predictive r2.
		See Song et al. (2020) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007565 for a
		detailed presentation of the method.
