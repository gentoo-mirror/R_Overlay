		Models for Drying and Soaking Kinetics of Seeds // Bringing
		together tools for modeling drying and soaking (rehydration)
		kinetics of seeds. This package contains several widely used
		predictive models (e.g.: da Silva et al., 2018). As these are
		nonlinear, the functions are interactive-based and easy-to-use.
		Least squares estimates are obtained with just a few visual
		adjustments of the initial parameter values. Reference: da
		Silva AR et al. (2018) doi:10.2134/agronj2017.07.0373.
