		Goodness-of-Fit Tests Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence // An
		implementation of Vasicek and Song goodness-of-fit tests.
		Several functions are provided to estimate differential Shannon
		entropy, i.e., estimate Shannon entropy of real random
		variables with density, and test the goodness-of-fit of some
		family of distributions, including uniform, Gaussian, log-
		normal, exponential, gamma, Weibull, Pareto, Fisher, Laplace
		and beta distributions; see Lequesne and Regnault (2018)
		arXiv:1806.07244.
