		Credible Visualization for Two-Dimensional Projections of Data //
		Projections are common dimensionality reduction methods, which
		represent high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space.
		However, when restricting the output space to two dimensions,
		which results in a two dimensional scatter plot (projection) of
		the data, low dimensional similarities do not represent high
		dimensional distances coercively [Thrun, 2018] DOI:
		10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9. This could lead to a misleading
		interpretation of the underlying structures [Thrun, 2018]. By
		means of the 3D topographic map the generalized Umatrix is able
		to depict errors of these two-dimensional scatter plots. The
		package is derived from the book of Thrun, M.C.: "Projection
		Based Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm
		Intelligence" (2018) DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9 and the main
		algorithm called simplified self-organizing map for
		dimensionality reduction methods is published in DOI:
		10.1016/j.mex.2020.101093.
