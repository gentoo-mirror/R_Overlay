		Credible Visualization for Two-Dimensional Projections of Data //
		Projections from a high-dimensional data space onto a two-
		dimensional plane are used to detect structures, such as
		clusters, in multivariate data. The generalized Umatrix is able
		to visualize errors of these two-dimensional scatter plots by
		using a 3D topographic map.
