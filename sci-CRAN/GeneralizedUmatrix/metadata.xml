		Credible Visualization for Two-Dimensional Projections of Data //
		Projections are common dimensionality reduction methods, which
		represent high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space.
		However, when restricting the output space to two dimensions,
		which results in a two dimensional scatter plot (projection) of
		the data, low dimensional similarities do not represent high
		dimensional distances coercively [Thrun, 2018]. This could lead
		to a misleading interpretation of the underlying structures
		[Thrun, 2018]. By means of the 3D topographic map the
		generalized Umatrix is able to depict errors of these two-
		dimensional scatter plots. The package is based on the book of
		Thrun, M.C.: "Projection Based Clustering through Self-
		Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018)
