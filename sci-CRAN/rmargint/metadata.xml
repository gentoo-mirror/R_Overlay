		Robust Marginal Integration Procedures // Three robust marginal
		integration procedures for additive models based on local
		polynomial kernel smoothers. As a preliminary estimator of the
		multivariate function for the marginal integration procedure, a
		first approach uses local constant M-estimators, a second one
		uses local polynomials of order 1 over all the components of
		covariates, and the third one uses M-estimators based on local
		polynomials but only in the direction of interest. For this
		last approach, estimators of the derivatives of the additive
		functions can be obtained. All three procedures can compute
		predictions for points outside the training set if desired. See
		Boente and Martinez (2017) doi:10.1007/s11749-016-0508-0 for
		details.
