		Interface to the 'Spectator Earth' API // Provides interface to
		the 'Spectator Earth' API https://api.spectator.earth/, mainly
		for obtaining the acquisition plans and satellite overpasses
		for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites. Current
		position and trajectory can also be obtained for a much larger
		set of satellites. It is also possible to search the archive
		for available images over the area of interest for a given
		(past) period, get the URL links to download the whole image
		tiles, or alternatively to download the image for just the area
		of interest based on selected spectral bands.
