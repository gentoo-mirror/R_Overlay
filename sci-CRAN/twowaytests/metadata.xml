		Two-Way Tests in Independent Groups Designs // Performs two-way
		tests in independent groups designs. These are two-way ANOVA,
		two-way ANOVA under heteroscedasticity: parametric bootstrap
		based generalized test and generalized pivotal quantity based
		generalized test, two-way ANOVA for medians, trimmed means,
		M-estimators. The package performs descriptive statistics and
		graphical approaches. Moreover, it assesses variance
		homogeneity and normality of data in each group via tests and
		plots. All 'twowaytests' functions are designed for two-way
		layout  (Dag et al., 2024, doi:10.1016/j.softx.2024.101862).
