		A Numerical Implementation of Interval-Valued Kriging // An
		interval-valued extension of ordinary and simple kriging.
		Optimization of the function is based on a generalized interval
		distance. This creates a non-differentiable cost function that
		requires a differentiable approximation to the absolute value
		function. This differentiable approximation is optimized using
		a Newton-Raphson algorithm with a penalty function to impose
		the constraints. Analyses in the package are driven by the
		'intsp' and 'intgrd' classes, which are interval-valued
		extensions of 'SpatialPointsDataFrame' and
		'SpatialPixelsDataFrame' respectively. The package includes
		several wrappers to functions in the 'gstat' and 'sp' packages.
