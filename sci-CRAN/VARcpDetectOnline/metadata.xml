		Sequential Change Point Detection for High-Dimensional VAR Models
		// Implements the algorithm introduced in Tian, Y., and
		Safikhani, A. (2024) doi:10.5705/ss.202024.0182, "Sequential
		Change Point Detection in High-dimensional Vector Auto-
		regressive Models". This package provides tools for detecting
		change points in the transition matrices of VAR models,
		effectively identifying shifts in temporal and cross-
		correlations within high-dimensional time series data.
