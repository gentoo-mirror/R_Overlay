		Sequential Change Point Detection for High-Dimensional VAR Models
		// Implements the algorithm introduced in Tian, Y., and
		Safikhani, A. (2024) doi:10.5705/ss.202024.0182, "Sequential
		Change Point Detection in High-dimensional Vector Auto-
		regressive Models". This package provides tools for detecting
		change points in the transition matrices of Vector Auto-
		Regressive (VAR) models, effectively identifying shifts in
		temporal and cross-correlations within high-dimensional time
		series data. The package includes functions to generate
		synthetic VAR data, detect change points in high-dimensional
		time series, and analyze real-world data. It also demonstrates
		an application to financial data: the daily log returns of 186
		SP 500 stocks from 2004-02-06 to 2016-03-02.
