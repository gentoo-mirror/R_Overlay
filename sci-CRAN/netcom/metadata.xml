		Dynamic Network Alignment // Functions to take two networks
		stored as matrices and return a node-level injection between
		them (bijection if the input networks are of the same size).
		The alignment is made by giving the Hungarian algorithm a
		symmetric cost matrix where entries are the numerical
		difference in the distributions over time of diffusion within
		each network originating from each node.
