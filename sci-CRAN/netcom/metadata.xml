		Dynamic Network Alignment // Functions to take two networks
		stored as matrices and return a node-level injection between
		them (bijection if the input networks are of the same size).
		The alignment is made by comparing diffusion kernels
		originating from each node in one network to those originating
		from each node in the other network. This creates a cost matrix
		where rows are nodes from one network and columns are nodes
		from the other network. Optimal node pairings are then found
		using the Hungarian algorithm.
