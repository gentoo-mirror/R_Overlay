		Datasets to Align Financial Markets with Climate Goals // These
		datasets support the implementation in R of the software
		'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment), which
		is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
		assets and climate scenarios (https://2degrees-investing.org/).
		Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
		allocation impacts the climate. Because both financial
		institutions and market data providers keep their data private,
		this package provides fake, public data to enable the
		development and use of 'PACTA' in R.
