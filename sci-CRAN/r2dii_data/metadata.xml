		Datasets to Measure the Alignment of Corporate Loan Books with
		Climate Goals // These datasets support the implementation in R
		of the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition
		Assessment), which is a free tool that calculates the alignment
		between corporate lending portfolios and climate scenarios
		(https://2degrees-investing.org/). Financial institutions use
		'PACTA' to study how their capital allocation decisions align
		with climate change mitigation goals. Because both financial
		institutions and market data providers keep their data private,
		this package provides fake, public data to enable the
		development and use of 'PACTA' in R.
