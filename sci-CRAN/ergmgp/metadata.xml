		Tools for Modeling ERGM Generating Processes // Provides tools
		for simulating draws from continuous time processes with well-
		defined exponential family random graph (ERGM) equilibria, i.e.
		ERGM generating processes (EGPs).  A number of EGPs are
		supported, including the families identified in Butts (2023)
		doi:10.1080/0022250X.2023.2180001, as are functions for hazard
		calculation and timing calibration.
