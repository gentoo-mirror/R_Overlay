		Internal Fragment Identification from Top-Down Mass Spectrometry
		// Top-Down mass spectrometry aims to identify entire proteins
		as well as their (post-translational) modifications or ions
		bound (eg Chen et al (2018) doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04747).
		The pattern of internal fragments (Haverland et al (2017)
		doi:10.1007/s13361-017-1635-x) may reveal important information
		about the original structure of the proteins studied (Skinner
		et al (2018) doi:10.1038/nchembio.2515 and Li et al (2018)
		doi:10.1038/nchem.2908). However, the number of possible
		internal fragments gets huge with longer proteins and
		subsequent identification of internal fragments remains
		challenging, in particular since the the accuracy of
		measurements with current mass spectrometers represents a
		limiting factor. This package attempts to deal with the
		complexity of internal fragments and allows identification of
		terminal and internal fragments from deconvoluted mass-
		spectrometry data.
