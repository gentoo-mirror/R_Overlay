		Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Large Data Using a Spectral SPDE
		Approach // Functionality for spatio-temporal modeling of large
		data sets is provided. A Gaussian process in space and time is
		defined through a stochastic partial differential equation
		(SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after
		discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space
		model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational
		difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in
		sampling from the full conditional of the spectral
		coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process.
		In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-
		temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is
		computationally advantageous. See Sigrist, Kuensch, and Stahel
		(2015) doi:10.1111/rssb.12061 for more information on the
		methodology. This package aims at providing tools for two
		different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-
		temporal model can be used as a component in a customized
		hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package
		then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model
		as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for
		doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC
		algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an
		algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling.
		The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a
		censored distribution with point mass at zero. Covariates can
		be included in the model through a regression term.
