		Hierarchical Models for Parametric and Semi-Parametric Analyses
		of Semi-Competing Risks Data // Hierarchical multistate models
		are considered to perform the analysis of independent/clustered
		semi-competing risks data. The package allows to choose the
		specification for model components from a range of options
		giving users substantial flexibility, including: accelerated
		failure time or proportional hazards regression models;
		parametric or non-parametric specifications for baseline
		survival functions and cluster-specific random effects
		distribution; a Markov or semi-Markov specification for
		terminal event following non-terminal event. While estimation
		is mainly performed within the Bayesian paradigm, the package
		also provides the maximum likelihood estimation approach for
		several para- metric models. The package also includes
		functions for univariate survival analysis as complementary
		analysis tools.
