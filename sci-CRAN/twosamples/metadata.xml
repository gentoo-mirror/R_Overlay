		Fast Permutation Based Two Sample Tests // Fast randomization
		based two sample tests. Testing the hypothesis that two samples
		come from the same distribution using randomization to create
		p-values. Included tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper,
		Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling. There is also a very
		efficient test based on the Wasserstein Distance. The default
		test 'two_sample' builds on the Wasserstein distance by using a
		weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling. We also include
		the permutation scheme to make test building simple for others.
