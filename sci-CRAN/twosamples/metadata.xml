		Fast Permutation Based Two Sample Tests // Fast randomization
		based two sample tests. Testing the hypothesis that two samples
		come from the same distribution using randomization to create
		p-values. Included tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper,
		Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling. There is also a very
		efficient new test based on the Wasserstein Distance as the
		default, 'two_sample', which builds on the Wasserstein distance
		by using a weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling. See
		the companion paper at arXiv:2007.01360 or
		https://codowd.com/public/DTS.pdf for details of that test
		statistic, and non-standard uses of the package (parallel for
		big N, weighted observations, etc). We also include the
		permutation scheme to make test building simple for others.
