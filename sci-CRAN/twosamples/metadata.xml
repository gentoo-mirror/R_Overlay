		Fast Permutation Based Two Sample Tests // Fast randomization
		based two sample tests. Testing the hypothesis that two samples
		come from the same distribution using randomization to create
		p-values. Included tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper,
		Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, Wasserstein, and DTS. The
		default test (two_sample) is based on the DTS test statistic,
		as it is the most powerful, and thus most useful to most users.
		The DTS test statistic builds on the Wasserstein distance by
		using a weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling. See the
		companion paper at arXiv:2007.01360 or
		https://codowd.com/public/DTS.pdf for details of that test
		statistic, and non-standard uses of the package (parallel for
		big N, weighted observations, one sample tests, etc). We also
		include the permutation scheme to make test building simple for
		others.
