		Quantile G-Computation Extensions for Effect Measure Modification
		// G-computation for a set of time-fixed exposures with
		quantile-based basis functions, possibly under linearity and
		homogeneity assumptions. Effect measure modification in this
		method is a way to assess how the effect of the mixture varies
		by a binary, categorical or continuous variable. Reference:
		Alexander P. Keil, Jessie P. Buckley, Katie M. OBrien, Kelly K.
		Ferguson, Shanshan Zhao, and Alexandra J. White (2019) A
		quantile-based g-computation approach to addressing the effects
		of exposure mixtures; doi:10.1289/EHP5838.
