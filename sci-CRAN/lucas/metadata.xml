		Package to Download and Create the DB of LUCAS Data Harmonized //
		Reproduces the harmonized DB of the ESTAT survey of the same
		name. The survey data is served as separate spreadsheets with
		noticeable differences in the collected attributes. The tool
		here presented carries out a series of instructions that
		harmonize the attributes in terms of name, meaning, and
		occurrence, while also introducing a series of new variables,
		instrumental to adding value to the product. Outputs include
		one harmonized table with all the years, and three separate
		geometries, corresponding to the theoretical point, the gps
		location where the measurement was made and the 250m east-
		facing transect.
