		Finds the Price of Anarchy for Routing Games // Computes the
		optimal flow, Nash flow and the Price of Anarchy for any
		routing game defined within the game theoretical framework. The
		input is a routing game in the form of its cost and flow
		functions. Then transforms this into an optimisation problem,
		allowing both Nash and Optimal flows to be solved by nonlinear
		optimisation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_game
		and Knight and Harper (2013) doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2013.04.003 for
		more information.
