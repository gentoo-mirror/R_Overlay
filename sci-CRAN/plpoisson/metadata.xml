		Prediction Limits for Poisson Distribution // Prediction limits
		for the Poisson distribution are produced from both frequentist
		and Bayesian viewpoints. Limiting results are provided in a
		Bayesian setting with uniform, Jeffreys and gamma as prior
		distributions. More details on the methodology are discussed in
		Bejleri and Nandram (2018) doi:10.1080/03610926.2017.1373814.
