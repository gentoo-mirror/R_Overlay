		The Analysis of Dark Adaptation Data // The recovery of visual
		sensitivity in a dark environment is known as dark adaptation.
		In a clinical or research setting the recovery is typically
		measured after a dazzling flash of light and can be described
		by the Mahroo, Lamb and Pugh (MLP) model of dark adaptation.
		The functions in this package take dark adaptation data and use
		nonlinear regression to find the parameters of the model that
		'best' describe the data. They do this by firstly, generating
		rapid initial objective estimates of data adaptation
		parameters, then a multi-start algorithm is used to reduce the
		possibility of a local minimum. There is also a bootstrap
		method to calculate parameter confidence intervals. The
		functions rely upon a 'dark' list or object. This object is
		created as the first step in the workflow and parts of the
		object are updated as it is processed.
