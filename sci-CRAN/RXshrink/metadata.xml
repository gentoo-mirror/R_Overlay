		Maximum Likelihood Shrinkage using Generalized Ridge or Least
		Angle Regression Methods // Functions are provided to calculate
		and display ridge TRACE diagnostics for a wide variety of
		alternative shrinkage Paths. While all methods focus on Maximum
		Likelihood estimation of unknown true effects under Normal-
		distribution theory, some estimates are modified to be Unbiased
		or to have "Correct Range" when estimating either [1] the
		noncentrality of the F-ratio for testing that true Beta
		coefficients are Zeros or [2] the "relative" MSE Risk (i.e. MSE
		divided by true sigma-square, where the "relative" variance of
		OLS is known.) The unr.ridge() function implements the
		"Unrestricted Path" introduced in Obenchain (2020)
		arXiv:2005.14291. This "new" p-parameter Shrinkage-Path and
		that of eff.ridge() are both more efficient than the Paths used
		by qm.ridge(), aug.lars() and uc.lars(). Functions eff.aug()
		and eff.biv() augment the calculations made by eff.ridge() to
		provide plots of the bivariate confidence ellipses
		corresponding to any of the p*(p-1) possible pairs of shrunken
		regression coefficients.
