		Maximum Likelihood Shrinkage using Generalized Ridge or Least
		Angle Regression Methods // Functions are provided to calculate
		and display ridge TRACEs for various shrinkage PATHS. They
		determine the m-Extent of shrinkage most likely, under Normal-
		distribution theory, to produce biased estimates of regression
		(beta) coefficients with minimum MSE Risk. An alternative
		function, correct.signs(), provides beta coefficient estimates
		when an ill-conditioned (nearly multicollinear) model yields
		OLS estimates with ("wrong") numerical signs that disagree with
		the signs of the observed correlations between the Y-outcome
		and the selected X-predictor variables. In-Sample predictions
		can be made for all five-types of RXshrink linear regression
		model estimation.
