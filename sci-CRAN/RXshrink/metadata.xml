		Maximum Likelihood Shrinkage using Generalized Ridge or Least
		Angle Regression Methods // Functions are provided to calculate
		and display ridge TRACE diagnostics for a variety of shrinkage
		Paths. TRACEs identify the m-Extent of shrinkage most likely,
		under Normal-theory, to produce optimally biased estimates of
		beta-coefficients with minimum MSE Risk. The unr.ridge()
		function implements the "Unrestricted Path" introduced in
		Obenchain (2020) arXiv:2005.14291. This Shrinkage-Path is more
		efficient than the Paths used by the qm.ridge(), aug.lars() and
		uc.lars() functions. Optimally biased predictions can be made
		using RXpredict() for all six types of RXshrink linear model
		estimation methods. Functions MLboot(), MLcalc(), MLhist() and
		MLtrue() provide insights into the true bias and MSE risk
		characteristics of non-linear Shrinkage estimators. Functions
		unr.aug() and unr.biv() augment the calculations made by
		unr.ridge() to provide plots of the bivariate confidence
		ellipses corresponding to any of the p*(p-1) possible pairs of
		shrunken regression coefficients. The correct.signs() function
		provides estimates with "correct" numerical signs when ill-
		conditioned (nearly multicollinear) models yield OLS estimates
		that disagree with the signs of the observed correlations
		between the y-outcome and the selected x-predictor variables.
		Finally, the YonX() function displays Shrinkage statistics and
		graphics for "simple" linear regression (p = 1) models.
