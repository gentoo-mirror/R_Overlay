		Approximate Algorithm for Horseshoe Prior // Provides an
		approximate algorithm for the horseshoe estimator used in
		Bayesian linear models. By implementing a sampler with high
		computational cost in the 'Rcpp' package and using an
		approximate algorithm that reduces matrix calculation
		complexity, parameter estimation speed for high-dimensional
		sparse data is faster. The approximate algorithm is described
		in Johndrow et al. (2020)
