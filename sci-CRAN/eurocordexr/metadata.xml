		Makes it Easier to Work with Daily 'netCDF' from EURO-CORDEX RCMs
		// Daily 'netCDF' data from e.g. regional climate models (RCMs)
		are not trivial to work with. This package, which relies on
		'data.table', makes it easier to deal with large data from
		RCMs, such as from EURO-CORDEX (https://www.euro-cordex.net/,
		https://cordex.org/data-access/). It has functions to extract
		single grid cells from rotated pole grids as well as the whole
		array in long format. Can handle non-standard calendars (360,
		noleap) and interpolate them to a standard one. Potentially
		works with many CF-conform 'netCDF' files.
