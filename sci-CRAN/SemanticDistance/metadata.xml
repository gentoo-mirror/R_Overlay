		Compute Semantic Distance Between Text Constituents // Cleans and
		formats language transcripts guided by a series of
		transformation options (e.g., lemmatize words, omit stopwords,
		split strings across rows). 'SemanticDistance' computes two
		distinct metrics of cosine semantic distance (experiential and
		embedding). These values reflect pairwise cosine distance
		between different elements or chunks of a language sample.
		'SemanticDistance' can process monologues (e.g., stories,
		ordered text), dialogues (e.g., conversation transcripts), word
		pairs arrayed in columns, and unordered word lists. Users
		specify options for how they wish to chunk distance
		calculations. These options include: rolling ngram-to-word
		distance (window of n-words to each new word), ngram-to-ngram
		distance (2-word chunk to the next 2-word chunk), pairwise
		distance between words arrayed in columns, matrix comparisons
		(i.e., all possible pairwise distances between words in an
		unordered list), turn-by-turn distance (talker to talker in a
		dialogue transcript). 'SemanticDistance' includes visualization
		options for analyzing distances as time series data and simple
		semantic network dynamics (e.g., clustering, undirected graph
		network).
