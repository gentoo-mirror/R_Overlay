		Swarm Space Creation // Provides a pipeline for the comparative
		analysis of collective movement data (e.g. fish schools, bird
		flocks, baboon troops) by processing 2-dimensional positional
		data (x,y,t) from GPS trackers or computer vision tracking
		systems, discretizing events of collective motion, calculating
		a set of established metrics that characterize each event, and
		placing the events in a multi-dimensional swarm space
		constructed from these metrics. The swarm space concept, the
		metrics and data sets included are described in: Papadopoulou
		Marina, Furtbauer Ines, O'Bryan Lisa R., Garnier Simon,
		Georgopoulou Dimitra G., Bracken Anna M., Christensen Charlotte
		and King Andrew J. (2023) doi:10.1098/rstb.2022.0068.
