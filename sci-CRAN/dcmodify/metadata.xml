		Modify Data Using Externally Defined Modification Rules // Data
		cleaning scripts typically contain a lot of 'if this change
		that' type of statements. Such statements are typically
		condensed expert knowledge. With this package, such 'data
		modifying rules' are taken out of the code and become in stead
		parameters to the work flow. This allows one to maintain,
		document, and reason about data modification rules separately
		from the workflow.
