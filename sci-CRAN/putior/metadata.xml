		"Register In- and Outputs for Workflow Visualization" // Provides
		tools for extracting and processing structured annotations from
		'R' and 'Python' source files to facilitate workflow
		visualization. The package scans source files for special 'PUT'
		annotations that define nodes, connections, and metadata within
		a data processing workflow. These annotations can then be used
		to generate visual representations of data flows and processing
		steps across polyglot software environments. Builds on concepts
		from literate programming Knuth (1984)
		doi:10.1093/comjnl/27.2.97 and utilizes directed acyclic graph
		(DAG) theory for workflow representation Foraita, Spallek, and
		Zeeb (2014) doi:10.1007/978-0-387-09834-0_65. Diagram
