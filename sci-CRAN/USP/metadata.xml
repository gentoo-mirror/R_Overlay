		U-Statistic Permutation Tests of Independence for all Data Types
		// Implements various independence tests for discrete,
		continuous, and infinite-dimensional data. The tests are based
		on a U-statistic permutation test, the USP of Berrett,
		Kontoyiannis and Samworth (2020) arXiv:2001.05513, and shown to
		be minimax rate optimal in a wide range of settings. As the
		permutation principle is used, all tests have exact, non-
		asymptotic Type I error control at the nominal level.
