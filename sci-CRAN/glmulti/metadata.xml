		Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Made Easy // Automated
		model selection and model-averaging. Provides a wrapper for glm
		and other functions, automatically generating all possible
		models (under constraints set by the user) with the specified
		response and explanatory variables, and finding the best models
		in terms of some Information Criterion (AIC, AICc or BIC). Can
		handle very large numbers of candidate models. Features a
		Genetic Algorithm to find the best models when an exhaustive
		screening of the candidates is not feasible.
