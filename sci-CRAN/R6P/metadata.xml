		Design Patterns in R // Build robust and maintainable software
		with object-oriented design patterns in R. Design patterns
		abstract and present in neat, well-defined components and
		interfaces the experience of many software designers and
		architects over many years of solving similar problems. These
		are solutions that have withstood the test of time with respect
		to re-usability, flexibility, and maintainability. 'R6P'
		provides abstract base classes with examples for a few known
		design patterns. The patterns were selected by their
		applicability to analytic projects in R. Using these patterns
		in R projects have proven effective in dealing with the
		complexity that data-driven applications possess.
