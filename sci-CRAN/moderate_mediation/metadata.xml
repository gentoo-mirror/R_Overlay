		Causal Moderated Mediation Analysis // Causal moderated mediation
		analysis using the methods proposed by Qin and Wang (2022).
		Causal moderated mediation analysis is crucial for
		investigating how, for whom, and where a treatment is effective
		by assessing the heterogeneity of mediation mechanism across
		individuals and contexts. This package enables researchers to
		estimate and test the conditional and moderated mediation
		effects, assess their sensitivity to unmeasured pre-treatment
		confounding, and visualize the results. The package is built
		based on the quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo method, because it has
		relatively better performance at small sample sizes, and its
		running speed is the fastest. The package is applicable to a
		treatment of any scale, a binary or continuous mediator, a
		binary or continuous outcome, and one or more moderators of any
		scale.
