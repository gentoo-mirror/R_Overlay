		Efficient Maximum Likelihood Identification // Provides
		implementations of computationally efficient maximum likelihood
		estimation algorithms for system identification tasks.
		Currently, one such algorithm is implemented which identifies
		the one-dimensional cumulative structural equation model with
		normality assumptions. The corresponding scientific paper is
		yet to be published, therefore the relevant reference is not
		available yet.
