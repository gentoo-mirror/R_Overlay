		Computationally Efficient Maximum Likelihood Identification of
		Linear Dynamical Systems // Provides implementations of
		computationally efficient maximum likelihood parameter
		estimation algorithms for models representing linear dynamical
		systems. Currently, two such algorithms (one offline and one
		online) are implemented for the single-output cumulative
		structural equation model with an additive-noise output
		measurement equation and assumptions of normality and
		independence. The corresponding scientific papers are
		referenced in the descriptions of the functions implementing
		these algorithms.
