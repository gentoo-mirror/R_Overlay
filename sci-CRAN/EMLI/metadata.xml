		Computationally Efficient Maximum Likelihood Identification of
		Linear Dynamical Systems // Provides implementations of
		computationally efficient maximum likelihood parameter
		estimation algorithms for models that represent linear
		dynamical systems. Currently, one such algorithm is implemented
		for the one-dimensional cumulative structural equation model
		with shock-error output measurement equation and assumptions of
		normality and independence. The corresponding scientific paper
		is yet to be published, therefore the relevant reference will
		be provided later.
