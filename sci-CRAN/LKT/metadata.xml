		Logistic Knowledge Tracing // Computes Logistic Knowledge Tracing
		('LKT') which is a general method for tracking human learning
		in an educational software system. Please see Pavlik,
		Eglington, and Harrel-Williams (2021)
		https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9616435. 'LKT' is a method
		to compute features of student data that are used as predictors
		of subsequent performance. 'LKT' allows great flexibility in
		the choice of predictive components and features computed for
		these predictive components. The system is built on top of
		'LiblineaR', which enables extremely fast solutions compared to
		base glm() in R.
