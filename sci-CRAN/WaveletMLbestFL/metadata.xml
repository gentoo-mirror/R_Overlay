		The Best Wavelet Filter-Level for Prepared Wavelet-Based Models
		// Four filters have been chosen namely 'haar', 'c6', 'la8',
		and 'bl14' (Kindly refer to 'wavelets' in 'CRAN' repository for
		more supported filters). Levels of decomposition are 2, 3, 4,
		etc. up to maximum decomposition level which is ceiling value
		of logarithm of length of the series base 2. For each
		combination two models are run separately. Results are stored
		in 'input'. First five metrics are expected to be minimum and
		last three metrics are expected to be maximum for a model to be
		considered good. Firstly, every metric value (among first five)
		is searched in every columns and minimum values are denoted as
		'MIN' and other values are denoted as 'NA'. Secondly, every
		metric (among last three) is searched in every columns and
		maximum values are denoted as 'MAX' and other values are
		denoted as 'NA'. 'output' contains the similar number of rows
		(which is 8) and columns (which is number filter-level
		combinations) as of 'input'. Values in 'output' are
		corresponding 'NA', 'MIN' or 'MAX'. Finally, the column
		containing minimum number of 'NA' values is denoted as the best
		('FL'). In special case, if two columns having equal 'NA', it
		has been checked among these two columns which one is having
		least 'NA' in first five rows and has been inferred as the
		best. 'FL_metrics_values' are the corresponding metrics values.
		'WARIGAANbest' is the data frame (dimension: 1*8) containing
		different metrics of the best filter-level combination.  More
		details can be found in Garai and others (2023)
