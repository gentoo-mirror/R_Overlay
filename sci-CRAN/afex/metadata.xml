		Analysis of Factorial Experiments // Convenience functions for
		analyzing factorial experiments using ANOVA or mixed models.
		aov_ez(), aov_car(), and aov_4() allow specification of
		between, within (i.e., repeated-measures), or mixed between-
		within (i.e., split-plot) ANOVAs for data in long format (i.e.,
		one observation per row), aggregating multiple observations per
		individual and cell of the design. mixed() fits mixed models
		using lme4::lmer() and computes p-values for all fixed effects
		using either Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximation for
		degrees of freedom (LMM only), parametric bootstrap (LMMs and
		GLMMs), or likelihood ratio tests (LMMs and GLMMs). afex uses
		type 3 sums of squares as default (imitating commercial
		statistical software).
