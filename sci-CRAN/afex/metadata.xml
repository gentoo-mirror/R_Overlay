		Analysis of Factorial Experiments // Convenience functions for
		analyzing factorial experiments using ANOVA or mixed models.
		aov_ez(), aov_car(), and aov_4() allow specification of
		between, within (i.e., repeated-measures), or mixed (i.e.,
		split-plot) ANOVAs for data in long format (i.e., one
		observation per row), automatically aggregating multiple
		observations per individual and cell of the design. mixed()
		fits mixed models using lme4::lmer() and computes p-values for
		all fixed effects using either Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite
		approximation for degrees of freedom (LMM only), parametric
		bootstrap (LMMs and GLMMs), or likelihood ratio tests (LMMs and
		GLMMs). afex_plot() provides a high-level interface for
		interaction or one-way plots using ggplot2, combining raw data
		and model estimates. afex uses type 3 sums of squares as
		default (imitating commercial statistical software).
