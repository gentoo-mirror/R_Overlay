		Automatic Database Normalisation for Data Frames // Automatic
		normalisation of a data frame to third normal form, with the
		intention of easing the process of data cleaning. (Usage to
		design your actual database for you is not advised.) Originally
		inspired by the 'AutoNormalize' library for 'Python' by
		'Alteryx' (https://github.com/alteryx/autonormalize), with
		various changes and improvements. Automatic discovery of
		functional or approximate dependencies, normalisation based on
		those, and plotting of the resulting "database" via 'Graphviz',
		with options to exclude some attributes at discovery time, or
		remove discovered dependencies at normalisation time.
