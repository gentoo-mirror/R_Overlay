		"Resolvable Partially Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (PBIBDs)"
		// A collection of several utility functions related to
		resolvable and affine resolvable Partially Balanced Incomplete
		Block Designs (PBIBDs), have been developed. In the class of
		resolvable designs, affine resolvable designs are said to be
		optimal, Bailey (1995) doi:10.2307/2337638. Here, the package
		contains three functions to generate and study the
		characterization properties of these designs. Developed
		functions are named as PBIBD1(), PBIBD2() and PBIBD3(), in
		which first two functions are used to generate two new series
		of affine resolvable PBIBDs and last one is used to generate a
		new series of resolvable PBIBDs, respectively.  In addition,
		these functions can also be used to generate design parameters
		(v, b, r and k), canonical efficiency factors, variance factor
		between associates and average variance factors of the
		generated designs. Here v is the number of treatments, b (= b1
		+ b2, in case of non-proper design) is the number of blocks, r
		is the number of replications and k (= k1 + k2; k1 is the size
		of b1 and k2 is the size of b2) is the block size.
