		Download Data from Bundesbank // Download data from the time-
		series databases of the Bundesbank, the German central bank.
		See the overview at the Bundesbank website
		(https://www.bundesbank.de/en/statistics/time-series-databases)
		for available series. The package provides only a single
		function, getSeries(), which supports both traditional and
		real-time datasets; it will also download meta data if
		available. Downloaded data can automatically be arranged in
		various formats, such as data frames or 'zoo' series. The data
		may optionally be cached, so as to avoid repeated downloads of
		the same series.
