		Exploratory Data Analysis using Tiled One-Dimensional Graphics //
		Streamlines exploratory data analysis by providing a turnkey
		approach to visualising n-dimensional data which graphically
		reveals correlative or associative relationships between 2 or
		more features. Represents all dataset features as distinct,
		vertically aligned bar or tile plots, with plot types auto-
		selected based on whether variables are categorical or numeric.
