		Bias Reduction in Binomial-Response Generalized Linear Models //
		Fit generalized linear models with binomial responses using
		either an adjusted-score approach to bias reduction or maximum
		penalized likelihood where penalization is by Jeffreys
		invariant prior. These procedures return estimates with
		improved frequentist properties (bias, mean squared error) that
		are always finite even in cases where the maximum likelihood
		estimates are infinite (data separation). Fitting takes place
		by fitting generalized linear models on iteratively updated
		pseudo-data. The interface is essentially the same as 'glm'.
		More flexibility is provided by the fact that custom pseudo-
		data representations can be specified and used for model
		fitting. Functions are provided for the construction of
		confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates.
