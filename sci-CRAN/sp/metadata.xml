		Classes and Methods for Spatial Data // Classes and methods for
		spatial data; the classes document where the spatial location
		information resides, for 2D or 3D data. Utility functions are
		provided, e.g. for plotting data as maps, spatial selection, as
		well as methods for retrieving coordinates, for subsetting,
		print, summary, etc. From this version, 'rgdal', 'maptools',
		and 'rgeos' are no longer used at all, see
		https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html for details.
