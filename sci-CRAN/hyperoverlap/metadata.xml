		Overlap Detection in n-Dimensional Space // Uses support vector
		machines to identify a perfectly separating hyperplane (linear
		or curvilinear) between two entities in high-dimensional space.
		If this plane exists, the entities do not overlap. Applications
		include overlap detection in morphological, resource or
		environmental dimensions. More details can be found in: Brown
		et al. (2020) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13363 .
