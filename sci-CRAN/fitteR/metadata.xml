		Fit Hundreds of Theoretical Distributions to Empirical Data //
		Systematic fit of hundreds of theoretical univariate
		distributions to empirical data via maximum likelihood
		estimation. Fits are reported and summarized by a data.frame, a
		csv file or a 'shiny' app (here with additional features like
		visual representation of fits). All output formats provide
		assessment of goodness-of-fit by the following methods:
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Shapiro-Wilks test, Anderson-Darling
		test.
