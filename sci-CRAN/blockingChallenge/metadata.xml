		Create Blocks or Strata which are Similar Within // Implements a
		heuristic algorithm to build blocks of a given size aiming to
		maximize similarity within strata across multiple covariates.
		The blocking structure can be used for causal inference and for
		sensitivity analysis to unmeasured confounding. A stratified
		structure gives more flexibility for using multiple
		instrumental variables and direct treatment vs. control
		analysis as evidence factors. Karmakar, B., Small, D. S., and
		Rosenbaum, P. R. (2018). Rosenbaum, P. R.
