		Generalized Reporter Score-Based Enrichment Analysis for Omics
		Data // Inspired by the classic 'RSA', we developed the
		improved 'Generalized Reporter Score-based Analysis (GRSA)'
		method, implemented in the R package 'ReporterScore', along
		with comprehensive visualization methods and pathway databases.
		'GRSA' is a threshold-free method that works well with all
		types of biomedical features, such as genes, chemical
		compounds, and microbial species. Importantly, the 'GRSA'
		supports multi-group and longitudinal experimental designs,
		because of the included multi-group-compatible statistical
		methods.
