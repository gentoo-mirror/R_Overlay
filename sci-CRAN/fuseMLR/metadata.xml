		Fusing Machine Learning in R // Recent technological advances
		have enable the simultaneous collection of multi-omics data
		i.e., different types or modalities of molecular data,
		presenting challenges for integrative prediction modeling due
		to the heterogeneous, high-dimensional nature and possible
		missing modalities of some individuals. We introduce this
		package for late integrative prediction modeling, enabling
		modality-specific variable selection and prediction modeling,
		followed by the aggregation of the modality-specific
		predictions to train a final meta-model. This package
		facilitates conducting late integration predictive modeling in
		a systematic, structured, and reproducible way.
