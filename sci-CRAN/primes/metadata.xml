		Fast Functions for Prime Numbers // Fast functions for dealing
		with prime numbers, such as testing whether a number is prime
		and generating a sequence prime numbers. Additional functions
		include finding prime factors and Ruth-Aaron pairs, finding
		next and previous prime numbers in the series, finding or
		estimating the nth prime, estimating the number of primes less
		than or equal to an arbitrary number, computing primorials,
		prime k-tuples (e.g., twin primes), finding the greatest common
		divisor and smallest (least) common multiple, testing whether
		two numbers are coprime, and computing Euler's totient
		function. Most functions are vectorized for speed and
		convenience.
