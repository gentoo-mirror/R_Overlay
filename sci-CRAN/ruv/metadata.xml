		Detect and Remove Unwanted Variation using Negative Controls //
		Implements the 'RUV' (Remove Unwanted Variation) algorithms.
		These algorithms attempt to adjust for systematic errors of
		unknown origin in high-dimensional data.  The algorithms were
		originally developed for use with genomic data, especially
		microarray data, but may be useful with other types of high-
		dimensional data as well.  These algorithms were proposed by
		Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012), and by Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob
		and Speed (2013).  The algorithms require the user to specify a
		set of negative control variables, as described in the
		references.  The algorithms included in this package are
		'RUV-2', 'RUV-4', 'RUV-inv', 'RUV-rinv', 'RUV-I', and RUV-III',
		along with various supporting algorithms.
