		Detect and Remove Unwanted Variation using Negative Controls //
		Implements the 'RUV' (Remove Unwanted Variation) algorithms.
		These algorithms attempt to adjust for systematic errors of
		unknown origin in high-dimensional data.  The algorithms were
		originally developed for use with genomic data, especially
		microarray data, but may be useful with other types of high-
		dimensional data as well.  These algorithms were proposed in
		Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012) doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433, Gagnon-
		Bartsch, Jacob and Speed (2013), and Molania, et. al. (2019)
		doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433.  The algorithms require the user to
		specify a set of negative control variables, as described in
		the references.  The algorithms included in this package are
		'RUV-2', 'RUV-4', 'RUV-inv', 'RUV-rinv', 'RUV-I', and RUV-III',
		along with various supporting algorithms.
