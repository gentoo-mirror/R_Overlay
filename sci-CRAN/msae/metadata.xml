		Multivariate Fay Herriot Models for Small Area Estimation //
		Implements multivariate Fay-Herriot models for small area
		estimation. It uses empirical best linear unbiased prediction
		(EBLUP) estimator. Multivariate models consider the correlation
		of several target variables and borrow strength from auxiliary
		variables to improve the effectiveness of a domain sample size.
		Models which accommodated by this package are univariate model
		with several target variables (model 0), multivariate model
		(model 1), autoregressive multivariate model (model 2), and
		heteroscedastic autoregressive multivariate model (model 3).
		Functions provide EBLUP estimators and mean squared error (MSE)
		estimator for each model. These models were developed by
		Roberto Benavent and Domingo Morales (2015)
