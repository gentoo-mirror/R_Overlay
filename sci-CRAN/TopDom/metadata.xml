		An Efficient and Deterministic Method for Identifying Topological
		Domains in Genomes // The 'TopDom' method identifies
		topological domains in genomes from Hi-C sequence data (Shin et
		al., 2016 doi:10.1093/nar/gkv1505).  The authors published an
		implementation of their method as an R script (two different
		versions; also available in this package).  This package
		originates from those original 'TopDom' R scripts and provides
		help pages adopted from the original 'TopDom' PDF
		documentation.  It also provides a small number of bug fixes to
		the original code.
