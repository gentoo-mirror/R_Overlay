		Selective Sweep Discovery Tool // Selective sweep is a biological
		phenomenon in which genetic variation between neighboring
		beneficial mutant alleles is swept away due to the effect of
		genetic hitchhiking. Detection of selective sweep is not well
		acquainted as well as it is a laborious job. This package is a
		user friendly approach for detecting selective sweep in genomic
		regions. It uses a Random Forest based machine learning
		approach to predict selective sweep from VCF files as an input.
		Input of this function, train data and new data, can be
		computed using the project
		https://github.com/AbhikSarkar1999/SweepDiscovery in 'GitHub'.
		This package has been developed by using the concept of
		Pavlidis and Alachiotis (2017) doi:10.1186/s40709-017-0064-0.
