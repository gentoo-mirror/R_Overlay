		Growth Charts via Smooth Regression Quantiles with Automatic
		Smoothness Estimation and Additive Terms // Fits non-crossing
		regression quantiles as a function of linear covariates and
		multiple smooth terms, including varying coefficients, via
		B-splines with L1-norm difference penalties. The smoothing
		parameters are estimated as part of the model fitting, see
		Muggeo and others (2021) doi:10.1177/1471082X20929802.
		Monotonicity and concavity constraints on the fitted curves are
		allowed, see Muggeo and others (2013)
		doi:10.1007/s10651-012-0232-1 and also
		doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.12924.85122 for some code examples.
