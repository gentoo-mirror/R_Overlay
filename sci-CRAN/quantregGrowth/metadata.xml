		Non-Crossing Additive Regression Quantiles and Non-Parametric
		Growth Charts // Fits non-crossing regression quantiles as a
		function of linear covariates and multiple smooth terms,
		including varying coefficients, via B-splines with L1-norm
		difference penalties. Random intercepts and variable selection
		are allowed via the lasso penalties. The smoothing parameters
		are estimated as part of the model fitting, see Muggeo and
		others (2021) doi:10.1177/1471082X20929802. Monotonicity and
		concavity constraints on the fitted curves are allowed, see
		Muggeo and others (2013) doi:10.1007/s10651-012-0232-1, and
		also doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.12924.85122 or
		doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.29306.21445 some code examples.
