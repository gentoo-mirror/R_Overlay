		Anonymization of Spatial Point Patterns and Raster Objects //
		Spatial data anonymization preserves confidentiality. Using
		methods described in Zandbergen (2014) doi:10.1155/2014/567049,
		spatial data anonymization is achieved by dithering original
		spatial coordinates with combinations of randomized vertical,
		horizontal and rotational shifts. This can apply to non-grid
		spatial point patterns and raster objects, and the methods
		preserve the same spatial characteristics and relationships of
		the original data. Unique hash keying enables data subjected to
		anonymization sequences to be re-identified where required.
