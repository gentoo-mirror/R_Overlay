		Heritability of Gene Expression for Next-Generation Sequencing //
		Statistical framework to analyze heritability of gene
		expression based on next-generation sequencing data and
		simulating sequencing reads. Variance partition coefficients
		(VPC) are computed using linear mixed effects and generalized
		linear mixed effects models. Compound Poisson and negative
		binomial models are included. Reference: Rudra, Pratyaydipta,
		et al. "Model based heritability scores for high-throughput
		sequencing data." BMC bioinformatics 18.1 (2017): 143.
