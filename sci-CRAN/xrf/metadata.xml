		eXtreme RuleFit // An implementation of the RuleFit algorithm as
		described in Friedman  Popescu (2008) doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148.
		eXtreme Gradient Boosting ('XGBoost') is used to build rules,
		and 'glmnet' is used to fit a sparse linear model on the raw
		and rule features. The result is a model that learns similarly
		to a tree ensemble, while often offering improved
		interpretability and achieving improved scoring runtime in live
		applications. Several algorithms for reducing rule complexity
		are provided, most notably hyperrectangle de-overlapping. All
		algorithms scale to several million rows and support sparse
		representations to handle tens of thousands of dimensions.
