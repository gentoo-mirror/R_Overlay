		Significance Analysis of Event-Related Potentials Data //
		Functions for signal detection and identification designed for
		Event-Related Potentials (ERP) data in a linear model
		framework. The functional F-test proposed in Causeur, Sheu,
		Perthame, Rufini (2018, submitted) for analysis of variance
		issues in ERP designs is implemented for signal detection
		(tests for mean difference among groups of curves in One-way
		ANOVA designs for example). Once an experimental effect is
		declared significant, identification of significant intervals
		is achieved by the multiple testing procedures reviewed and
		compared in Sheu, Perthame, Lee and Causeur (2016,
		DOI:10.1214/15-AOAS888). Some of the methods gathered in the
		package are the classical FDR- and FWER-controlling procedures,
		also available using function p.adjust. The package also
		implements the Guthrie-Buchwald procedure (Guthrie and
		Buchwald, 1991 DOI:10.1111/j.1469-8986.1991.tb00417.x), which
		accounts for the auto-correlation among t-tests to control
		erroneous detection of short intervals. The Adaptive Factor-
		Adjustment method is an extension of the method described in
		Causeur, Chu, Hsieh and Sheu (2012,
		DOI:10.3758/s13428-012-0230-0). It assumes a factor model for
		the correlation among tests and combines adaptively the
		estimation of the signal and the updating of the dependence
		modelling (see Sheu et al., 2016, DOI:10.1214/15-AOAS888 for
		further details).
