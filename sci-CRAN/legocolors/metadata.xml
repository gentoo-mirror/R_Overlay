		Official Lego Color Palettes // Provides a dataset containing
		several color naming conventions established by multiple
		sources, along with associated color metadata. The package also
		provides related helper functions for mapping among the
		different Lego color naming conventions and between Lego
		colors, hex colors, and 'R' color names. The functions include
		nearest color matching based on Euclidean distance in RGB
		space. Naming conventions for color mapping include those from
		'BrickLink' (https://www.bricklink.com), 'The Lego Group'
		(https://www.lego.com), 'LDraw' (https://www.ldraw.org/), and
		'Peeron' (http://www.peeron.com/).
