		Official Lego Color Palettes // Provides a dataset containing
		several color naming conventions established by multiple
		sources, along with associated color metadata. The package also
		provides related helper functions for mapping among the
		different Lego color naming conventions and between Lego
		colors, hex colors, and 'R' color names, making it easy to
		convert any color palette to one based on existing Lego colors
		while keeping as close to the original color palette as
		possible. The functions use nearest color matching based on
		Euclidean distance in RGB space. Naming conventions for color
		mapping include those from 'BrickLink'
		(https://www.bricklink.com), 'The Lego Group'
		(https://www.lego.com), 'LDraw' (https://www.ldraw.org/), and
		'Peeron' (http://www.peeron.com/).
