		Robust Factor Analysis for Tensor Time Series // Tensor Factor
		Models (TFM) are appealing dimension reduction tools for high-
		order tensor time series, and have wide applications in
		economics, finance and medical imaging. We propose an one-step
		projection estimator by minimizing the least-square loss
		function, and further propose a robust estimator with an
		iterative weighted projection technique by utilizing the Huber
		loss function. The methods are discussed in Barigozzi et al.
