		Covariate-Adjusted Tensor Classification in High-Dimensions //
		Performs classification and variable selection on high-
		dimensional tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) after adjusting
		for additional covariates (scalar or vectors) as CATCH model in
		Pan, Mai and Zhang (2018) arXiv:1805.04421. The low-dimensional
		covariates and the high-dimensional tensors are jointly modeled
		to predict a categorical outcome in a multi-class discriminant
		analysis setting. The Covariate-Adjusted Tensor Classification
		in High-dimensions (CATCH) model is fitted in two steps: (1)
		adjust for the covariates within each class; and (2) penalized
		estimation with the adjusted tensor using a cyclic block
		coordinate descent algorithm. The package can provide a
		solution path for tuning parameter in the penalized estimation
		step. Special case of the CATCH model includes linear
		discriminant analysis model and matrix (or tensor) discriminant
		analysis without covariates.
