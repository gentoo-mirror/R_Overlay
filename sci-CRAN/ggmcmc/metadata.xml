		Tools for Analyzing MCMC Simulations from Bayesian Inference //
		Tools for assessing and diagnosing convergence of Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo simulations, as well as for graphically display
		results from full MCMC analysis. The package also facilitates
		the graphical interpretation of models by providing flexible
		functions to plot the results against observed variables, and
		functions to work with hierarchical/multilevel batches of
		parameters (Fernndez-i-Marn, 2016 doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i09).
