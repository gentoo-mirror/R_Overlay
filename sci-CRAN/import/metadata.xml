		An Import Mechanism for R // Alternative mechanism for importing
		objects from packages and R modules. The syntax allows for
		importing multiple objects with a single command in an
		expressive way. The import package bridges some of the gap
		between using library (or require) and direct (single-object)
		imports. Furthermore the imported objects are not placed in the
		current environment.
