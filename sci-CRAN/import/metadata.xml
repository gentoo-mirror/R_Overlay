		An Import Mechanism for R // This is an alternative mechanism for
		importing objects from packages. The syntax allows for
		importing multiple objects from a package with a single command
		in an expressive way. The import package bridges some of the
		gap between using library (or require) and direct (single-
		object) imports. Furthermore the imported objects are not
		placed in the current environment.
