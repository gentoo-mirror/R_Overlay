		Smooth Hazard Ratio Curves Taking a Reference Value // Provides
		flexible hazard ratio curves allowing non-linear relationships
		between continuous predictors and survival. To better
		understand the effects that each continuous covariate has on
		the outcome, results are expressed in terms of hazard ratio
		curves, taking a specific covariate value as reference.
		Confidence bands for these curves are also derived.
