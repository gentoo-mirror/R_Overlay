		Mean and Scale-Factor Modeling of Under- And Over-Dispersed
		Binary Data // Under- and over-dispersed binary data are
		modeled using an extended Poisson process model (EPPM)
		appropriate for binary data. A feature of the model is that the
		under-dispersion relative to the binomial distribution only
		needs to be greater than zero, but the over-dispersion is
		restricted compared to other distributional models such as the
		beta and correlated binomials. Because of this, the examples
		focus on under-dispersed data and how, in combination with the
		beta or correlated distributions, flexible models can be fitted
		to data displaying both under- and over-dispersion. Using
		Generalized Linear Model (GLM)  terminology, the functions
		utilize linear predictors for the probability of success and
		scale-factor with various link functions for p, and log link
		for scale-factor, to fit a variety of models relevant to areas
		such as bioassay. Details of the EPPM are in Faddy and Smith
		(2012) doi:10.1002/bimj.201100214 and Smith and Faddy (2019)
