		Raw Accelerometer Data Analysis // A tool to process and analyse
		data collected with wearable raw acceleration sensors as
		described in van Hees and colleagues (2014) doi:
		10.1152/japplphysiol.00421.2014 and (2015) doi:
		10.1371/journal.pone.0142533. The package has been developed
		and tested for binary data from 'GENEActiv'
		https://www.activinsights.com/ and GENEA devices (not for
		sale), .csv-export data from  'Actigraph'
		http://actigraphcorp.com devices, and .cwa and .wav-format data
		from 'Axivity' https://axivity.com/product/ax3. These devices
		are currently widely used in research on human daily physical
		activity.
