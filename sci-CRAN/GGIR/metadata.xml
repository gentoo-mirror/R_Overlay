		Raw Accelerometer Data Analysis // A tool to process and analyse
		data collected with wearable raw acceleration sensors. The
		package has been developed and tested for binary data from
		GENEActiv and GENEA devices, .csv-export data from  Actigraph
		devices, and .cwa and .wav-format data from Axivity. These
		devices are currently widely used in research on human daily
		physical activity.
