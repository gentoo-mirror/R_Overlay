		Raw Accelerometer Data Analysis // A tool to process and analyse
		data collected with wearable raw acceleration sensors as
		described in Migueles and colleagues (JMPB 2019), and van Hees
		and colleagues (JApplPhysiol 2014; PLoSONE 2015). The package
		has been developed and tested for binary data from 'GENEActiv'
		https://www.activinsights.com/ and GENEA devices (not for
		sale), .csv-export data from  'Actigraph'
		https://actigraphcorp.com devices, and .cwa and .wav-format
		data from 'Axivity' https://axivity.com. These devices are
		currently widely used in research on human daily physical
		activity. Further, the package can handle accelerometer data
		file from any other sensor brand providing that the data is
		stored in csv format and has either no header or a two column
		header. Also the package allows for external function
		embedding.
