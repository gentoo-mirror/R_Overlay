		Bootstrap Based Goodness-of-Fit Tests // Bootstrap based
		goodness-of-fit tests. It allows to perform rigorous
		statistical tests to check if a chosen model family is correct
		based on the marked empirical process. The implemented
		algorithms are described in (Dikta and Scheer (2021)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-030-73480-0) and can be applied to
		generalized linear models without any further implementation
		effort. As far as certain linearity conditions are fulfilled
		the resampling scheme are also applicable beyond generalized
		linear models. This is reflected in the software architecture
		which allows to reuse the resampling scheme by implementing
		only certain interfaces for models that are not supported
		natively by the package.
