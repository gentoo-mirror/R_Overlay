		ML and MCMC Methods for Pedigree Reconstruction and Analysis //
		The primary aim of MasterBayes is to use MCMC techniques to
		integrate over uncertainty in pedigree configurations estimated
		from molecular markers and phenotypic data.  Emphasis is put on
		the marginal distribution of parameters that relate the
		phenotypic data to the pedigree. All simulation is done in
		compiled C++ for efficiency.
