		Set 'RStudio' Preferences // As of 'RStudio' v1.3, the
		preferences in the Global Options dialog (and a number of other
		preferences that arent) are now saved in simple, plain-text
		JSON files. This package provides an interface for working with
		these 'RStudio' JSON preference files to easily make
		modifications without using the point-and-click option menus.
		This is particularly helpful when working on teams to ensure a
		unified experience across machines and utilizing settings for
		best practices.
