		Tools for Managing Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) Data // A
		comprehensive suite of tools for managing, processing, and
		analyzing data from the IFCB. I R FlowCytobot ('iRfcb')
		supports quality control, geospatial analysis, and preparation
		of IFCB data for publication in databases like
		https://www.gbif.org, https://www.obis.org,
		https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en, https://shark.smhi.se/, and
		https://www.ecotaxa.org. The package integrates with the MATLAB
		'ifcb-analysis' tool, which is described in Sosik and Olson
		(2007) doi:10.4319/lom.2007.5.204, and provides features for
		working with raw, manually classified, and machine
		learningclassified image datasets. Key functionalities include
		image extraction, particle size distribution analysis,
		taxonomic data handling, and biomass concentration
		calculations, essential for plankton research.
