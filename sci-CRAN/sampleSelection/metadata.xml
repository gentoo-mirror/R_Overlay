		Sample Selection Models // Two-step and maximum likelihood
		estimation of Heckman-type sample selection models: standard
		sample selection models (Tobit-2), endogenous switching
		regression models (Tobit-5), sample selection models with
		binary dependent outcome variable, interval regression with
		sample selection (only ML estimation), and endogenous treatment
		effects models. These methods are described in the three
		vignettes that are included in this package and in econometric
		textbooks such as Greene (2011, Econometric Analysis, 7th
		edition, Pearson).
