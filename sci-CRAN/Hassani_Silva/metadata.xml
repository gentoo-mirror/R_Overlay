		A Test for Comparing the Predictive Accuracy of Two Sets of
		Forecasts // A non-parametric test founded upon the principles
		of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, referred to as the KS
		Predictive Accuracy (KSPA) test. The KSPA test is able to serve
		two distinct purposes. Initially, the test seeks to determine
		whether there exists a statistically significant difference
		between the distribution of forecast errors, and secondly it
		exploits the principles of stochastic dominance to determine
		whether the forecasts with the lower error also reports a
		stochastically smaller error than forecasts from a competing
		model, and thereby enables distinguishing between the
		predictive accuracy of forecasts. KSPA test has been described
		in : Hassani and Silva (2015) doi:10.3390/econometrics3030590.
