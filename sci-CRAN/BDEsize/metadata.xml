		Efficient Determination of Sample Size in Balanced Design of
		Experiments // Provides the sample size in balanced design of
		experiments and three graphs ; detectable standardized effect
		size vs power, sample size vs detectable standardized effect
		size, and sample size vs power. Sample size is computed in
		order to detect a certain standardized effect size with power
		at the significance level. Three graphs show the mutual
		relationship between the sample size, power and the detectable
		standardized effect size. By investigating those graphs, it can
		be checked that which effects are sensitive to the efficient
		sample size determination. Lenth,R.V.(2006-9)
