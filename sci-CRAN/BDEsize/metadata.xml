		Efficient Determination of Sample Size in Balanced Design of
		Experiments // For a balanced design of experiments, this
		package calculates the sample size required to detect a certain
		standardized effect size, under a significance level. This
		package also provides three graphs; detectable standardized
		effect size vs power, sample size vs detectable standardized
		effect size, and sample size vs power, which show the mutual
		relationship between the sample size, power and the detectable
		standardized effect size. The detailed procedure is described
		in R. V. Lenth (2006-9)
