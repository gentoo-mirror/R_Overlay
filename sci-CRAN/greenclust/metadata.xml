		Combine Categories Using Greenacre's Method // Implements a
		method of iteratively collapsing the rows of a contingency
		table, two at a time, by selecting the pair of categories whose
		combination yields a new table with the smallest loss of chi-
		squared, as described by Greenacre, M.J. (1988)
		doi:10.1007/BF01901670. The result is compatible with the class
		of object returned by the 'stats' package's hclust() function
		and can be used similarly (plotted as a dendrogram, cut, etc.).
		Additional functions are provided for automatic cutting and
		diagnostic plotting.
