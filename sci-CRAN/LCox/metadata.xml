		A Tool for Selecting Genes Related to Survival Outcomes using
		Longitudinal Gene Expression Data // Longitudinal genomics data
		and survival outcome are common in biomedical studies. It is of
		great interest to select genes related to the survival outcome.
		LCox is a computationally efficient tool for selecting genes
		related to the survival outcome using the longitudinal genomics
		data. LCox is powerful to detect different forms of dependence
		between the longitudinal biomarkers and the survival outcome.
