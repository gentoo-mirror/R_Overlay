		Mountain Plots, Folded Empirical Cumulative Distribution Plots //
		Lattice functions for drawing folded empirical cumulative
		distribution plots, or mountain plots. A mountain plot is
		similar to an empirical CDF plot, except that the curve
		increases from 0 to 0.5, then decreases from 0.5 to 1 using an
		inverted scale at the right side.
