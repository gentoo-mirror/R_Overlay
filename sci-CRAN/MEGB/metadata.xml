		Gradient Boosting for Longitudinal Data // Gradient boosting is a
		powerful statistical learning method known for its ability to
		model complex relationships between predictors and outcomes
		while performing inherent variable selection. However,
		traditional gradient boosting methods lack flexibility in
		handling longitudinal data where within-subject correlations
		play a critical role. In this package, we propose a novel
		approach Mixed Effect Gradient Boosting ('MEGB'), designed
		specifically for high-dimensional longitudinal data. 'MEGB'
		incorporates a flexible semi-parametric model that embeds
		random effects within the gradient boosting framework, allowing
		it to account for within-individual covariance over time.
		Additionally, the method efficiently handles scenarios where
		the number of predictors greatly exceeds the number of
		observations (pn) making it particularly suitable for genomics
		data and other large-scale biomedical studies.
