		Rating and Evaluating Texts Using Large Language Models //
		Generates ratings and psycholinguistic metrics for textual
		stimuli using large language models. It enables users to
		evaluate idioms and other language materials by combining
		context, prompts, and stimulus inputs. It supports multiple LLM
		APIs (such as 'OpenAI', 'DeepSeek', 'Anthropic', 'Cohere',
		'Google PaLM', and 'Ollama') by allowing users to switch models
		with a single parameter. In addition to generating numeric
		ratings, 'chatRater' provides functions for obtaining detailed
		psycholinguistic metrics including word frequency (with
		optional corpus input), lexical coverage (with customizable
		vocabulary size and test basis), Zipf metric, Levenshtein
		distance, and semantic transparency.
