		Rating Text Using Large Language Models // Generates ratings for
		textual stimuli using large language models. It allows users to
		evaluate idioms and similar texts by combining context,
		prompts, and stimulus inputs. The package supports both
		'OpenAI' and 'DeepSeek' APIs by enabling users to switch models
		simply by specifying the model parameter. It implements methods
		for constructing the request payload and parsing numeric
		ratings from the model outputs.
