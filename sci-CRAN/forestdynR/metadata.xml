		Calculate Forest Dynamics // Determines the dynamics of tree
		species communities (mortality rates, recruitment, loss and
		gain in basal area, net changes and turnover). Important notes
		are a) The 'forest_df' argument (data) must contain the columns
		'plot' (plot identification), 'spp' (species identification),
		DBH_1 (Diameter at breast height in first year of measure) and
		DBH_2 (Diameter at breast height in  second year of measure).
		DBH_1 and DBH_2 must be numeric values; b) example input file
		in 'data(forest_df_example)'; c) The argument 'inv_time'
		represents the time between inventories, in years; d) The
		'coord' argument must be of the type 'c(longitude, latitude)',
		with decimal degree values; e) Argument 'add_wd' represents a
		dataframe with wood density values (g cm-3) format with three
		columns ('genus', 'species', 'wd'). This argument is set to
		NULL by default, and if isn't provided, the wood density will
		be estimated with the getWoodDensity() function from the
		'BIOMASS' package.
