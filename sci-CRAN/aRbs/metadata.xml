		Find Arbitrage Opportunities for Sports Matches // Money doesn't
		grow on trees. Arbitrage opportunities do. Find the best
		arbitrage opportunities (arbs) in sports matches through
		https://www.oddschecker.com/. This package allows the user to
		input the URLs of https://www.oddschecker.com/ subdomains in
		order to find any opportunities for arbitrage. The majority of
		the functionality is implemented using the function
		\code{get_arbs()}. This function first finds all subdomains of
		the URL entered, then filters to only include those that look
		like event betting pages. Next, odds are scraped from the
		various bookmakers listed for that event, before returning
		combinations of bookmakers, odds or outcomes that could be used
		for arbitrage. Bets placed subsequently are done so at bettor's
		risk and we take no responsibility for losses that may occur
		from use of this package. Odds subject to instantaneous
		changes.
