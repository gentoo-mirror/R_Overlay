		Functional Conditional Independence Testing with the GHCM // A
		statistical hypothesis test for conditional independence. Given
		residuals from a sufficiently powerful regression, it tests
		whether the covariance of the residuals is vanishing. It can be
		applied to both discretely-observed functional data and
		multivariate data. Details of the method can be found in Anton
		Rask Lundborg, Rajen D. Shah and Jonas Peters (2021)
		arXiv:2101.07108.
