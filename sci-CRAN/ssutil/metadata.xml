		Sample Size Calculation Tools // Functions for sample size
		estimation and simulation in clinical trials. Includes methods
		for selecting the best group using the Indifference-zone
		approach, as well as designs for non-inferiority, equivalence,
		and negative binomial models. For the sample size calculation
		for non-inferiority of vaccines, the approach is based on
		Fleming, Powers, and Huang (2021) doi:10.1177/1740774520988244.
		The Indifference-zone approach is based on Sobel and Huyett
		(1957) doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb02411.x and Bechhofer,
		Santner, and Goldsman (1995, ISBN:978-0-471-57427-9).
