		Calculations of One Discrete Model in Several Time Steps // A
		matrix discrete model having the form 'M[i+1] = (I + Q)*M[i]'.
		The calculation of the values of 'M[i]' only for pre-selected
		values of 'i'. The method of calculation is presented in the
		vignette 'Fundament' ('Base'). Maybe it`s own idea of the
		author of the package. A weakness is that the method gives
		information only in selected steps of the process. It mainly
		refers to cases with matrices that are not Markov chain. If 'Q'
		is Markov transition matrix, then MUPkL() may be used to
		calculate the steady-state distribution 'p' for 'p = Q*p'.
		Matrix power of non integer (matrix.powerni()) gives the same
		results as a mpower() from package 'matlib'. References:
		"Markov chains", (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Ex
		pected_number_of_visits). Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. (2005), "ON
		NON-INTEGER POWERS OF A SQUARE MATRIX",
