		Multidimensional Scaling Development Kit // Multidimensional
		scaling (MDS) functions for various tasks that are beyond the
		beta stage and way past the alpha stage. Currently, options are
		available for weights, restrictions, classical scaling or
		principal coordinate analysis, transformations (linear, power,
		Box-Cox, spline, ordinal), outlier mitigation (rdop), out-of-
		sample estimation (predict), negative dissimilarities, fast and
		faster executions with low memory footprints, penalized
		restrictions, cross-validation-based penalty selection,
		supplementary variable estimation (explain), additive constant
		estimation, mixed measurement level distance calculation,
		restricted classical scaling, etc. More will come in the
		future. References. Busing (2024) "A Simple Population Size
