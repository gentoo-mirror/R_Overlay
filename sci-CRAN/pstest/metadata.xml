		Specification Tests for Parametric Propensity Score Models // The
		propensity score is one of the most widely used tools in
		studying the causal effect of a treatment, intervention, or
		policy. Given that the propensity score is usually unknown, it
		has to be estimated, implying that the reliability of many
		treatment effect estimators depends on the correct
		specification of the (parametric) propensity score. This
		package implements the data-driven nonparametric diagnostic
		tools for detecting propensity score misspecification proposed
		by Sant'Anna and Song (2019) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.02.002.
