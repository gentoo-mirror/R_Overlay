		The Field of Cyclotomic Numbers // The cyclotomic numbers are
		complex numbers that can be thought of as the rational numbers
		extended with the roots of unity. They are represented exactly,
		enabling exact computations. They contain the Gaussian
		rationals (complex numbers with rational real and imaginary
		parts) as well as the square roots of all rational numbers.
		They also contain the sine and cosine of all rational multiples
		of pi. The algorithms implemented in this package are taken
		from the 'Haskell' package 'cyclotomic', whose algorithms are
		adapted from code by Martin Schoenert and Thomas Breuer in the
		'GAP' project (https://www.gap-system.org/). Cyclotomic numbers
		have applications in number theory, algebraic geometry,
		algebraic number theory, coding theory, and in the theory of
		graphs and combinatorics. They have connections to the theory
		of modular functions and modular curves.
