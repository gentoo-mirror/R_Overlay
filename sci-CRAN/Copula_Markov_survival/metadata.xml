		Copula Markov Model with Dependent Censoring // Perform
		likelihood estimation and corresponding analysis under the
		copula-based Markov chain model for serially dependent event
		times with a dependent terminal event. A two stage estimation
		method is applied for estimating model parameters. Two copula
		functions are used for measuring dependence. One is used for
		modeling serial dependence in recurrent event times. The other
		one is for modeling dependent censoring. The baseline hazard
		functions are modeled by the Weibull distributions. See Huang
		(2019) https://etd.lib.nctu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/gs32/ncugsweb.cgi?o=
