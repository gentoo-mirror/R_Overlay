		Informative Hypothesis Testing Web Applications // Offering
		enhanced statistical power compared to traditional hypothesis
		testing methods, informative hypothesis testing allows
		researchers to explicitly model their expectations regarding
		the relationships among parameters. An important software tool
		for this framework is 'restriktor'. The 'mmirestriktor' package
		provides 'shiny' web applications to implement some of the
		basic functionality of 'restriktor'. The mmirestriktor()
		function launches a 'shiny' application for fitting and
		analyzing models with constraints. The FbarCards() function
		launches a card game application which can help build intuition
		about informative hypothesis testing. The iht_interpreter()
		helps interpret informative hypothesis testing results based on
		guidelines in Vanbrabant and Rosseel (2020)
