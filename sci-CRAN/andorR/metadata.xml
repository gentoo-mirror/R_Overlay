		Optimisation of the Analysis of AND-OR Decision Trees // A
		decision support tool to strategically prioritise evidence
		gathering in complex, hierarchical AND-OR decision trees. It is
		designed for situations with incomplete or uncertain
		information where the goal is to reach a confident conclusion
		as efficiently as possible (responding to the minimum number of
		questions, and only spending resources on generating improved
		evidence when it is of significant value to the final
		decision). The framework excels in complex analyses with
		multiple potential successful pathways to a conclusion ('OR'
		nodes). Key features include a dynamic influence index to guide
		users to the most impactful question, a system for propagating
		answers and semi-quantitative confidence scores (0-5) up the
		tree, and post-conclusion guidance to identify the best actions
		to increase the final confidence. These components are brought
		together in an interactive command-line workflow that guides
		the analysis from start to finish.
