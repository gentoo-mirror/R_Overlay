		Signal Detection Analysis // Exploring time series for signal
		detection. It is specifically designed to detect possible
		outbreaks using infectious disease surveillance data at the
		European Union / European Economic Area or country level.
		Automatic detection tools used are presented in the paper
		"Monitoring count time series in R: aberration detection in
		public health surveillance", by Salmon (2016)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10. The package includes: - Signal
		Detection tool, an interactive 'shiny' application in which the
		user can import external data and perform basic signal
		detection analyses; - An automated report in HTML format,
		presenting the results of the time series analysis in tables
		and graphs. This report can also be stratified by population
		characteristics (see 'Population' variable). This project was
		funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
		Control.
