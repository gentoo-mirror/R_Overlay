		Planning and Analysing Survival Studies under Non-Proportional
		Hazards // Piecewise constant hazard functions are used to
		flexibly model survival distributions with non-proportional
		hazards and to simulate data from the specified distributions.
		A function to calculate weighted log-rank tests for the
		comparison of two hazard functions is included. Also, a
		function to calculate a test using the maximum of a set of test
		statistics from weighted log-rank tests (MaxCombo test) is
		provided. This test utilizes the asymptotic multivariate normal
		joint distribution of the separate test statistics. The
		correlation is estimated from the data. These methods are
		described in Ristl et al. (2021) doi:10.1002/pst.2062. Finally,
		a function is provided for the estimation and inferential
		statistics of various parameters that quantify the difference
		between two survival curves. Eligible parameters are
		differences in survival probabilities, log survival
		probabilities, complementary log log (cloglog) transformed
		survival probabilities, quantiles of the survival functions,
		log transformed quantiles, restricted mean survival times, as
		well as an average hazard ratio, the Cox model score statistic
		(logrank statistic), and the Cox-model hazard ratio.
		Adjustments for multiple testing and simultaneous confidence
		intervals are calculated using a multivariate normal
		approximation to the set of selected parameters.
