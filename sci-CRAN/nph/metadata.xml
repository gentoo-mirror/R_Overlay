		Planning and Analysing Survival Studies under Non-Proportional
		Hazards // Piecewise constant hazard functions are used to
		flexibly model survival distributions with non-proportional
		hazards and to simulate data from the specified distributions.
		Also, a function to calculate weighted log-rank tests for the
		comparison of two hazard functions is included. Finally, a
		function to calculate a test using the maximum of a set of test
		statistics from weighted log-rank tests is provided. This test
		utilizes the asymptotic multivariate normal joint distribution
		of the separate test statistics. The correlation is estimated
		from the data.
