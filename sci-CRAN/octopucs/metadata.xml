		Statistical Support for Hierarchical Clusters // Generates n
		hierarchical clustering hypotheses on subsets of classifiers
		(usually species in community ecology studies). The n
		clustering hypotheses are combined to generate a generalized
		cluster, and computes three metrics of support. 1) The average
		proportion of elements conforming the group in each of the n
		clusters (integrity). And 2) the contamination, i.e., the
		average proportion of elements from other groups that enter a
		focal group. 3) The probability of existence of the group gives
		the integrity and contamination in a Bayesian approach.
