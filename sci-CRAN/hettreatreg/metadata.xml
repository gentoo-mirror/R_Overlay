		Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Analysis //
		Computes diagnostics for linear regression when treatment
		effects are heterogeneous. The output of 'hettreatreg'
		represents ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of the effect
		of a binary treatment as a weighted average of the average
		treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and the average treatment
		effect on the untreated (ATU). The program estimates the OLS
		weights on these parameters, computes the associated model
		diagnostics, and reports the implicit OLS estimate of the
		average treatment effect (ATE). See Sloczynski (2019), http://p
		eople.brandeis.edu/~tslocz/Sloczynski_paper_regression.pdf.
