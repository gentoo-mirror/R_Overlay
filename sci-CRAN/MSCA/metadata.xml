		Unsupervised Clustering of Multiple Censored Time-to-Event
		Endpoints // Provides basic tools and wrapper functions for
		computing clusters of instances described by multiple time-to-
		event censored endpoints. From long-format datasets, where one
		instance is described by one or more dated records, the main
		function, `make_state_matrices()`, creates state matrices.
		Based on these matrices, optimised procedures using the Jaccard
		distance between instances enable the construction of
		longitudinal typologies. The package is under active
		development, with additional tools for graphical representation
		of typologies planned. For methodological details, see our
		accompanying paper: `Delord M, Douiri A (2025)
		doi:10.1186/s12874-025-02476-7`.
