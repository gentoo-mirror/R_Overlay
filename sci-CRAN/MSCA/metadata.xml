		Clustering of Multiple Censored Time-to-Event Endpoints //
		Provides basic tools for computing clusters of instances
		described by multiple time-to-event censored endpoints. From
		long-format datasets, where one instance is described by one or
		more records of events, a procedure is used to compute state
		matrices. Then, from state matrices, a procedure provides
		optimised computation of the Jaccard distance between
		instances. The library is currently in development, and more
		options and tools allowing graphical representation of
		typologies are expected. For methodological details, see our
		methodological paper: Delord M, Douiri A (2025)
