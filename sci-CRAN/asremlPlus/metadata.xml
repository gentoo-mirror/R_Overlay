		Augments the Use of 'ASReml-R' in Fitting Mixed Models // Assists
		in automating the testing of terms in mixed models when
		'asreml' is used to fit the models. The content falls into the
		following natural groupings: (i) Data, (ii) Object manipulation
		functions, (iii) Model modification functions, (iv) Model
		testing functions, (v) Model diagnostics functions, (vi)
		Prediction production and presentation functions, (vii)
		Response transformation functions, and (viii) Miscellaneous
		functions. A history of the fitting of a sequence of models is
		kept in a data frame. Procedures are available for choosing
		models that conform to the hierarchy or marginality principle
		and for displaying predictions for significant terms in tables
		and graphs. The package 'asreml' provides a computationally
		efficient algorithm for fitting mixed models using Residual
		Maximum Likelihood. It can be purchased from 'VSNi'
		http://www.vsni.co.uk/ as 'asreml-R', who will supply a zip
		file for local installation/updating.
