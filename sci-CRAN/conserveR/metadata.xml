		Identifying Conservation Prioritization Methods Based on Data
		Availability // Helping biologists to choose the most suitable
		approach to link their research to conservation. After
		answering few questions on the data available, geographic and
		taxonomic scope, 'conserveR' ranks existing methods for
		conservation prioritization and systematic conservation
		planning by suitability. The methods data base of 'conserveR'
		contains 133 methods for conservation prioritization based on a
		systematic review of  12,000 scientific publications from the
