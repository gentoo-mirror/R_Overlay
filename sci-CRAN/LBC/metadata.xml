		Logistic Box Cox // The logistic Box-Cox model is a formal
		method, which can accommodate the non-linear relationship
		between the log-odds and exposure via a shape parameter. Thus,
		it is superior to the common two-step approach, which adds a
		data transformation step before fitting a logistic regression
		model to accommodate any non-linearity in the disease-exposure
		relationship. This package includes key functions in our model
		and dataset for simulation. Simulation experiments can be
		reproduced following the Vignette.
