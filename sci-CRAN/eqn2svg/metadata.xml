		Create an SVG-Based Mathematical Formula // If you have a
		mathematical formula and the need to have that formula in the
		form of scalable vector graphics (SVG), you'll be delighted by
		what 'eqn2svg' will let you do. The incoming LaTeX math formula
		will be nicely converted to SVG tags. And you can use that code
		wherever SVGs are accepted.
