		Organising and Analysing Eye-Tracking Data // A set of functions
		for organising and analysing datasets from experiments run
		using 'Eyelink' eye-trackers. Organising functions help to
		clean and prepare eye-tracking datasets for analysis, and mark
		up key events such as display changes and responses made by
		participants. Analysing functions help to create means for a
		wide range of standard measures (such as 'mean fixation
		durations'), which can then be fed into the appropriate
		statistical analyses and graphing packages as necessary.
