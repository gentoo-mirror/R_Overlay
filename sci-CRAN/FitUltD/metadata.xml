		Fit Univariate Mixed and Usual Distributions // Extends the
		fitdist() (from 'fitdistrplus') adding the Anderson-Darling
		ad.test() (from 'ADGofTest') and Kolmogorov Smirnov Test
		ks.test() inside and trying the distributions (from 'stats') by
		default and offering a second function which uses mixed
		distributions to fit, this distributions are split with
		unsupervised learning, with Mclust() function (from 'mclust').
