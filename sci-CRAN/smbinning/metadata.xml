		Scoring Modeling and Optimal Binning // A set of functions to
		build a scoring model from beginning to end, leading the user
		to follow an efficient and organized development process,
		reducing significantly the time spent on data exploration,
		variable selection, feature engineering, binning and model
		selection among other recurrent tasks. The package also
		incorporates monotonic and customized binning, scaling
		capabilities that transforms logistic coefficients into points
		for a better business understanding and calculates and
		visualizes classic performance metrics of a classification
		model.
