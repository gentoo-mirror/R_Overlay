		Deep Neural Network Tools for Probability and Statistic Models //
		Contains tools to build deep neural network with flexible users
		define loss function and probability models. Several
		applications included in this package are, 1) The (deepAFT)
		model, a deep neural network model for accelerated failure time
		(AFT) model for survival data. 2) The (deepGLM) model, a deep
		neural network model for generalized linear model (glm) for
		continuous, categorical and Poisson data.
