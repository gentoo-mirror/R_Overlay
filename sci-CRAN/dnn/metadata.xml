		Deep Neural Network Tools for Probability and Statistic Models //
		Contains a robust set of tools designed for constructing deep
		neural networks, which are highly adaptable with user-defined
		loss function and probability models. It includes several
		practical applications, such as the (deepAFT) model, which
		utilizes a deep neural network approach to enhance the
		accelerated failure time (AFT) model for survival data. Another
		example is the (deepGLM) model that applies deep neural network
		to the generalized linear model (glm), accommodating data types
		with continuous, categorical and Poisson distributions.
