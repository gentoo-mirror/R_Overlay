		A Modified Fishers Method to Test Overall Gene-Level Effect //
		The separate p-values of SNPs, RNA expressions and DNA
		methylations are calculated by KM regression. The correlation
		between different omics data are taken into account. This
		method can be applied to either samples with all three types of
		omics data or samples with two types.
