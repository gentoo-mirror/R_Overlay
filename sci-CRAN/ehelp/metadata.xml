		Enhanced Help to Enable "Docstring"-Comments in Users Functions
		// By overloading the R help() function, this package allows
		users to use "docstring" style comments within their own
		defined functions. The package also provides additional
		functions to mimic the R basic example() function and the
		prototyping of packages.
