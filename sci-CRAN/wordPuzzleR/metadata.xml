		Word Puzzle Game // The word puzzle game requires you to find out
		the letters in a word within a limited number of guesses. In
		each round, if your guess hit any letters in the word, they
		reveal themselves. If all letters are revealed before your
		guesses run out, you win this game; otherwise you fail. You may
		run multiple games to guess different words.
