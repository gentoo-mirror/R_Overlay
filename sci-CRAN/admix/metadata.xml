		Package Admix for Admixture (aka Contamination) Models //
		Implements several methods to estimate the unknown quantities
		related to two-component admixture models, where the two
		components can belong to any distribution (note that in the
		case of multinomial mixtures, the two components must belong to
		the same family). Estimation methods depend on the assumptions
		made on the unknown component density (see Bordes and
		Vandekerkhove (2010) doi:10.3103/S1066530710010023; Patra and
		Sen (2016) doi:10.1111/rssb.12148); Milhaud, Pommeret, Salhi
		and Vandekerkhove (2021) https://hal.archives-
		ouvertes.fr/hal-03201760). In practice, one can estimate both
		the mixture weight and the unknown component density in a wide
		variety of frameworks. On top of that, hypothesis tests can be
		performed in one and two-samples contexts to test the unknown
		component density. Finally, clustering of unknown mixture
		components is also feasible in a K-samples setting.
