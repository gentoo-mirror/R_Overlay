		Power Calculation for Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trials //
		To meet the needs of statistical power calculation for stepped
		wedge cluster randomized trials, we developed this software.
		Different parameters can be specified by users for different
		scenarios, including: cross-sectional and cohort designs,
		binary and continuous outcomes, marginal (GEE) and conditional
		models (mixed effects model), three link functions (identity,
		log, logit links), with and without time effects (the default
		specification assumes no-time-effect) under exchangeable,
		nested exchangeable and block exchangeable correlation
		structures. Unequal numbers of clusters per sequence are also
		allowed. The methods included in this package: Zhou et al.
		(2020) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy031, Li et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1111/biom.12918. Supplementary documents can be found
		at: https://ysph.yale.edu/cmips/research/software/study-design-
		power-calculation/swdpwr/. The Shiny app for swdpwr can be
		accessed at:
		https://jiachenchen322.shinyapps.io/swdpwr_shinyapp/. The
		package also includes functions that perform calculations for
		the intra-cluster correlation coefficients based on the random
		effects variances as input variables for continuous and binary
		outcomes, respectively.
