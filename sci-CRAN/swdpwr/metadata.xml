		Power Calculation for Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trials //
		To meet the needs of statistical power calculation for stepped
		wedge cluster randomized trials, we developed this software.
		Different parameters can be specified by users for different
		scenarios, including: cohort and cross-sectional settings,
		binary and continuous outcomes, marginal (GEE) and conditional
		(mixed effect model) methods,  different link functions
		(identity, log, logit links), with and without time effect of
		treatment, etc. The methods included in this package: Zhou et
		al. (2020) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy031, Li et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1111/biom.12918. Supplementary documents can be found
		at:
		https://publichealth.yale.edu/cmips/research/software/swdpwr/.
		The Shiny app for swdpwr can be accessed at:
