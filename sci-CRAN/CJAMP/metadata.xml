		Copula-Based Joint Analysis of Multiple Phenotypes // We provide
		a computationally efficient and robust implementation of the
		recently proposed C-JAMP (Copula-based Joint Analysis of
		Multiple Phenotypes) method (Konigorski et al., 2019,
		submitted). C-JAMP allows estimating and testing the
		association of one or multiple predictors on multiple outcomes
		in a joint model, and is implemented here with a focus on
		large-scale genome-wide association studies with two
		phenotypes. The use of copula functions allows modeling a wide
		range of multivariate dependencies between the phenotypes, and
		previous results are supporting that C-JAMP can increase the
		power of association studies to identify associated genetic
		variants in comparison to existing methods (Konigorski, Yilmaz,
		Pischon, 2016, DOI:10.1186/s12919-016-0045-6; Konigorski,
		Yilmaz, Bull, 2014, DOI:10.1186/1753-6561-8-S1-S72). In
		addition to the C-JAMP functions, functions are available to
		generate genetic and phenotypic data, to compute the minor
		allele frequency (MAF) of genetic markers, and to estimate the
		phenotypic variance explained by genetic markers.
