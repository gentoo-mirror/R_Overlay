		Functions Useful in the Design and ANOVA of Experiments // The
		content falls into the following groupings: (i) Data, (ii)
		Factor manipulation functions, (iii) Design functions, (iv)
		ANOVA functions, (v) Matrix functions, (vi) Projector and
		canonical efficiency functions, and (vii) Miscellaneous
		functions. There is a vignette describing how to use the design
		functions for randomizing and assessing designs available as a
		vignette called 'DesignNotes'. The ANOVA functions facilitate
		the extraction of information when the 'Error' function has
		been used in the call to 'aov'. The package 'dae' can also be
		installed from http://chris.brien.name/rpackages/.
