		Penalized and Constrained Lasso Optimization // An implementation
		of both the equality and inequality constrained lasso functions
		for the algorithm described in "Penalized and Constrained
		Optimization" by James, Paulson, and Rusmevichientong (Journal
		of the American Statistical Association, 2019; see http://www-
		bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/research/PAC.pdf for a full-text version of
		the paper). The algorithm here is designed to allow users to
		define linear constraints (either equality or inequality
		constraints) and use a penalized regression approach to solve
		the constrained problem. The functions here are used
		specifically for constraints with the lasso formulation, but
		the method described in the PaC paper can be used for a variety
		of scenarios. In addition to the simple examples included here
		with the corresponding functions, complete code to entirely
		reproduce the results of the paper is available online through
		the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
