		Trade Objects, Advanced Correlation  Beta Estimates, Betting
		Strategies // Contains performance analysis metrics of track
		records including entropy-based correlation and dynamic beta
		based on a state/space algorithm. The normalized sample entropy
		method has been implemented which produces accurate entropy
		estimation even on smaller datasets. On a separate stream,
		trades from the five major assets classes and also
		functionality to use pricing curves, rating tables, Credit
		Support Annex and add-on tables. The implementation follows an
		object oriented logic whereby each trade inherits from more
		abstract classes while also the curves/tables are objects.
		Furthermore, odds calculators and PL back-testing functionality
		has been implemented for the most widely used betting/trading
		strategies including martingale, 'DAlembert', 'Labouchere' and
		Fibonacci. Back testing has also been included for the
		'EuroMillions', the 'EuroJackpot', the UK Lotto, the Set For
		Life and the UK 'ThunderBall' lotteries. Furthermore, some
		basic functionality about climate risk has been included.
