		CCR, Advanced Correlation  Beta Estimates, Betting Strategies //
		Contains performance analysis metrics of track records
		including entropy-based correlation and dynamic beta based on
		the Kalman filter. The normalized sample entropy method has
		been implemented which produces accurate entropy estimation
		even on smaller datasets while for the dynamic beta calculation
		the Kalman filter methodology has been utilized. On a separate
		stream, trades from the five major assets classes and also
		functionality to use pricing curves, rating tables, CSAs and
		add-on tables. The implementation follows an object oriented
		logic whereby each trade inherits from more abstract classes
		while also the curves/tables are objects. Furthermore, odds
		calculators and PL back-testing functionality has been
		implemented for the most widely used betting/trading strategies
		including martingale, DAlembert, Labouchere and Fibonacci.
		Back-testing has also been included for the EuroMillions and
		EuroJackpot lotteries. Furthermore, some basic functionality
		about climate risk has been included.
