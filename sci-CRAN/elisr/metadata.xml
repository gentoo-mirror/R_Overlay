		Exploratory Likert Scaling // An alternative to Exploratory
		Factor Analysis (EFA) for metrical data in R. Drawing on
		characteristics of classical test theory, Exploratory Likert
		Scaling (ELiS) supports the user exploring multiple one-
		dimensional data structures. In common research practice,
		however, EFA remains the go-to method to uncover the
		(underlying) structure of a data set. Orthogonal dimensions and
		the potential of overextraction are often accepted as side
		effects. As described in Mller-Schneider (2001)
		doi:10.1515/zfsoz-2001-0404), ELiS confronts these problems. As
		a result, 'elisr' provides the platform to fully exploit the
		exploratory potential of the multiple scaling approach itself.
