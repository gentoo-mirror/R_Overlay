		Data Sonification - Turning Data into Sound // Sonification (or
		audification) is the process of representing data by sounds in
		the audible range. This package provides the R function
		sonify() that transforms univariate data, sampled at regular or
		irregular intervals, into a continuous sound with time-varying
		frequency. The ups and downs in frequency represent the ups and
		downs in the data. Sonify provides a substitute for R's plot
		function to simplify data analysis for the visually impaired.
