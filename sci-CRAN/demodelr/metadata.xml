		Simulating Differential Equations with Data // Designed to
		support the visualization, numerical computation, qualitative
		analysis, model-data fusion, and stochastic simulation for
		autonomous systems of differential equations. Euler and Runge-
		Kutta methods are implemented, along with tools to visualize
		the two-dimensional phaseplane. Likelihood surfaces and a
		simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimator can be used
		for model-data fusion of differential equations and empirical
		models. The Euler-Maruyama method is provided for simulation of
		stochastic differential equations. The package was originally
		written for internal use to support teaching by Zobitz, and
		refined to support the text "Exploring modeling with data and
		differential equations using R" by John Zobitz (2021)
		https://jmzobitz.github.io/ModelingWithR/index.html.
