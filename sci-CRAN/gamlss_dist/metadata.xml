		Distributions for Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale
		and Shape // A set of distributions  which can be used  for
		modelling the response variables in Generalized Additive Models
		for Location Scale and Shape, Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005),
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x. The distributions can be
		continuous, discrete or mixed  distributions.  Extra
		distributions can be created, by transforming, any continuous
		distribution defined on the real line,  to  a distribution
		defined on ranges 0 to infinity  or  0 to 1,  by using a
		''log'' or a ''logit' transformation respectively.
