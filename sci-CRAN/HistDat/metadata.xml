		Summary Statistics for Histogram/Count Data // In some cases you
		will have data in a histogram format, where you have a vector
		of all possible observations, and a vector of how many times
		each observation appeared. You could expand this into a single
		1D vector, but this may not be advisable if the counts are
		extremely large. 'HistDat' allows for the calculation of
		summary statistics without the need for expanding your data.
