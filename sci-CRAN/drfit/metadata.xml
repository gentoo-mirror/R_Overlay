		Dose-Response Data Evaluation // A somewhat outdated package of
		basic and easy-to-use functions for fitting dose-response
		curves to continuous dose-response data, calculating some
		toxicological parameters and plotting the results. Please
		consider using the more powerful and actively developed 'drc'
		package.  Functions that are fitted are the cumulative density
		function of the log-normal distribution ('probit' fit), of the
		logistic distribution ('logit' fit), of the Weibull
		distribution ('weibull' fit) and a linear-logistic model
		('linlogit' fit), derived from the latter, which is used to
		describe data showing stimulation at low doses (hormesis). In
		addition, functions checking, plotting and retrieving dose-
		response data retrieved from a database accessed via 'odbc' are
		included. As an alternative to the original fitting methods,
		the algorithms from the 'drc' package can be used.
