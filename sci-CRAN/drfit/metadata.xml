		Dose-Response Data Evaluation // A somewhat outdated package of
		basic and easy-to-use functions for fitting dose-response
		curves to continuous dose-response data, calculating some
		(eco)toxicological parameters and plotting the results. Please
		consider using the more powerful and actively developed 'drc'
		package.  Functions that are fitted are the cumulative density
		function of the lognormal distribution (probit fit), of the
		logistic distribution (logit fit), of the weibull distribution
		(weibull fit) and a linear-logistic model ("linlogit" fit),
		derived from the latter, which is used to describe data showing
		stimulation at low doses (hormesis). In addition, functions
		checking, plotting and retrieving dose-response data retrieved
		from a database accessed via RODBC are included. As an
		alternative to the original fitting methods, the algorithms
		from the drc package can be used.
