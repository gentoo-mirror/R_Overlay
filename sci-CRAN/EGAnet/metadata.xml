		Exploratory Graph Analysis  a Framework for Estimating the Number
		of Dimensions in Multivariate Data using Network Psychometrics
		// Implements the Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) framework
		for dimensionality and psychometric assessment. EGA estimates
		the number of dimensions in psychological data using network
		estimation methods and community detection algorithms. A
		bootstrap method is provided to assess the stability of
		dimensions and items. Fit is evaluated using the Entropy Fit
		family of indices. Unique Variable Analysis evaluates the
		extent to which items are locally dependent (or redundant).
		Network loadings provide similar information to factor loadings
		and can be used to compute network scores. A bootstrap and
		permutation approach are available to assess configural and
		metric invariance. Hierarchical structures can be detected
		using Hierarchical EGA. Time series and intensive longitudinal
		data can be analyzed using Dynamic EGA, supporting individual,
		group, and population level assessments.
