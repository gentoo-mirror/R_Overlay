		Guide Sequence Design for CRISPR/Cas9 // Designs guide sequences
		for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and provides information on
		sequence features pertinent to guide efficiency. Sequence
		features include annotated off-target predictions in a user-
		selected genome and a predicted efficiency score based on the
		model described in Doench et al. (2016) doi:10.1038/nbt.3437.
		Users are able to import additional genomes and genome
		annotation files to use when searching and annotating off-
		target hits. All guide sequences and off-target data can be
		generated through the 'R' console with sgRNA_Design() or
		through 'crispRdesignR's' user interface with
		crispRdesignRUI(). CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced
		Short Palindromic Repeats) and the associated protein Cas9
		refer to a technique used in genome editing.
