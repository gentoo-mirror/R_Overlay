		A 'FRACTRAN' Interpreter and Some Helper Functions // 'FRACTRAN'
		is an obscure yet tantalizing programming language invented by
		John Conway of 'Game of Life' fame. The code consists of a
		sequence of fractions. The rules are simple. First, select an
		integer to initialize the process. Second, multiply the integer
		by the first fraction. If an integer results, start again with
		the new integer. If not, try the next fraction. Finally, if no
		such multiplication yields an integer, terminate the program.
