		Prioritizing Cancer Driver Genes Using Genomics Data // Cancer
		genomes contain large numbers of somatic alterations but few
		genes drive tumor development. Identifying cancer driver genes
		is critical for precision oncology. Most of current approaches
		either identify driver genes based on mutational recurrence or
		using estimated scores predicting the functional consequences
		of mutations. 'driveR' is a tool for personalized or batch
		analysis of genomic data for driver gene prioritization by
		combining genomic information and prior biological knowledge.
		As features, 'driveR' uses coding impact metaprediction scores,
		non-coding impact scores, somatic copy number alteration
		scores, hotspot gene/double-hit gene condition, 'phenolyzer'
		gene scores and memberships to cancer-related KEGG pathways. It
		uses these features to estimate cancer-type-specific
		probability for each gene of being a cancer driver using the
		related task of a multi-task learning classification model. The
		method is described in detail in Ulgen E, Sezerman OU. 2020.
