		Graphical Analysis of Variance // This small collection of
		functions provides what we call elemental graphics for display
		of analysis of variance results, David C. Hoaglin, Frederick
		Mosteller and John W. Tukey (1991, ISBN:978-0-471-52735-0),
		Paul R. Rosenbaum (1989) doi:10.2307/2684513, Robert M. Pruzek
		and James E. Helmreich
		https://jse.amstat.org/v17n1/helmreich.html. The term elemental
		derives from the fact that each function is aimed at
		construction of graphical displays that afford direct
		visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental
		questions that drive the particular analysis of variance
		methods. These functions can be particularly helpful for
		students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods
		should be quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications
		of all kinds, as they can help to identify outliers, clusters
		or patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear
		transformations of data.
