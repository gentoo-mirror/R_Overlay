		Bridging the gap between qualitative data and quantitative
		analysis // This package automates many of the tasks associated
		with quantitative discourse analysis of transcripts containing
		discourse including frequency counts of sentence types, words,
		sentences, turns of talk, syllables and other assorted analysis
		tasks.  The package provides parsing tools for preparing
		transcript data.  Many functions enable the user to aggregate
		data by any number of grouping variables, providing analysis
		and seamless integration with other R packages that undertake
		higher level analysis and visualization of text.  This affords
		the user a more efficient and targeted analysis.  qdap is
		designed for transcript analysis, however, many functions are
		applicable to other areas of Text Mining/Natural Language
		Processing.
