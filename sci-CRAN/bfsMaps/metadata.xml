		Plot Maps from Switzerland by Swiss Federal Statistical Office //
		At the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFSO), spatial maps of
		Switzerland are available free of charge as 'Cartographic bases
		for small-scale thematic mapping'. This package contains
		convenience functions to import ESRI (Environmental Systems
		Research Institute) shape files using the package 'sf' and to
		plot them easily and quickly without having to worry too much
		about the technical details. It contains utilities to combine
		multiple areas to one single polygon and to find neighbours for
		single regions. For any point on a map, a special locator can
		be used to determine to which municipality, district or canton
		it belongs.
