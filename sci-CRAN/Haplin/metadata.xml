		Analyzing Case-Parent Triad and/or Case-Control Data with SNP
		Haplotypes // Performs genetic association analyses of case-
		parent triad (trio) data with multiple markers. It can also
		incorporate complete or incomplete control triads, for instance
		independent control children. Estimation is based on
		haplotypes, for instance SNP haplotypes, even though phase is
		not known from the genetic data. Haplin estimates relative risk
		(RR + conf.int.) and p-value associated with each haplotype. It
		uses maximum likelihood estimation to make optimal use of data
		from triads with missing genotypic data, for instance if some
		SNPs has not been typed for some individuals. Haplin also
		allows estimation of effects of maternal haplotypes and parent-
		of-origin effects, particularly appropriate in perinatal
		epidemiology. Haplin allows special models, like
		X-inactivation, to be fitted on the X-chromosome.
