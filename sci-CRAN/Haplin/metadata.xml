		Analyzing Case-Parent Triad and/or Case-Control Data with SNP
		Haplotypes // Performs genetic association analyses of case-
		parent triad (trio) data with multiple markers. It can also
		incorporate complete or incomplete control triads, for instance
		independent control children. Estimation is based on
		haplotypes, for instance SNP haplotypes, even though phase is
		not known from the genetic data. 'Haplin' estimates relative
		risk (RR + conf.int.) and p-value associated with each
		haplotype. It uses maximum likelihood estimation to make
		optimal use of data from triads with missing genotypic data,
		for instance if some SNPs has not been typed for some
		individuals. 'Haplin' also allows estimation of effects of
		maternal haplotypes and parent-of-origin effects, particularly
		appropriate in perinatal epidemiology. 'Haplin' allows special
		models, like X-inactivation, to be fitted on the X-chromosome.
		A GxE analysis allows testing interactions between environment
		and all estimated genetic effects. The models were originally
		described in Gjessing, HK and Lie, RT (2006)
