		Bifurcation Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equation Systems //
		Shiny application that performs bifurcation and phaseplane
		analysis of systems of ordinary differential equations. The
		package allows for computation of equilibrium curves as a
		function of a single free parameter, detection of
		transcritical, saddle-node and hopf bifurcation points along
		these curves, and computation of curves representing these
		transcritical, saddle-node and hopf bifurcation points as a
		function of two free parameters. The shiny-based GUI allows
		visualization of the results in both 2D- and 3D-plots. The
		implemented methods for solution localisation and curve
		continuation are based on the book "Elements of applied
		bifurcation theory" (Kuznetsov, Y. A., 1995; ISBN:
		0-387-94418-4).
