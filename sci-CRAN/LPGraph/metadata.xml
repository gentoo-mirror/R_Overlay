		Nonparametric Smoothing of Laplacian Graph Spectra // A
		nonparametric method to approximate Laplacian graph spectra of
		a network with ordered vertices. This provides a
		computationally efficient algorithm for obtaining an accurate
		and smooth estimate of the graph Laplacian basis. The
		approximation results can then be used for tasks like change
		point detection, k-sample testing, and so on. The primary
		reference is Mukhopadhyay, S. and Wang, K. (2018, Technical
		Report).
