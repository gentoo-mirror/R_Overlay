		Aligning Ontology Annotation Across Single Cell Datasets with
		'scOntoMatch' // Unequal granularity of cell type annotation
		makes it difficult to compare scRNA-seq datasets at scale.
		Leveraging the ontology system for defining cell type
		hierarchy, 'scOntoMatch' aims to align cell type annotations to
		make them comparable across studies. The alignment involves two
		core steps: first is to trim the cell type tree within each
		dataset so each cell type does not have descendants, and then
		map cell type labels cross-studies by direct matching and
		mapping descendants to ancestors. Various functions for
		plotting cell type trees and manipulating ontology terms are
		also provided. In the Single Cell Expression Atlas hosted at
		EBI, a compendium of datasets with curated ontology labels are
		great inputs to this package.
