		Facilitating the Use of 'Stan' Within Packages // Infrastructure
		and functions that can be used for integrating 'Stan'
		(Carpenter et al. (2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v076.i01) code into
		stand alone R packages which in turn use the  'CmdStan' engine
		which is often accessed through 'CmdStanR'. Details given in
		Stan Development Team (2025) https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/.
		Using 'CmdStanR' and pre-written 'Stan' code can make package
		installation easy. Using 'staninside' offers a way to cache
		user-compiled 'Stan' models in user-specified directories
		reducing the need to recompile the same model multiple times.
