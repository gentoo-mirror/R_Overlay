		COPPE-Cosenza Fuzzy Hierarchy Model // The program implements the
		COPPE-Cosenza Fuzzy Hierarchy Model. The model was based on the
		evaluation of local alternatives, representing regional
		potentialities, so as to fulfill demands of economic projects.
		After defining demand profiles in terms of their technological
		coefficients, the degree of importance of factors is defined so
		as to represent the productive activity. The method can detect
		a surplus of supply without the restriction of the distance of
		classical algebra, defining a hierarchy of location
		alternatives. In COPPE-Cosenza Model, the distance between
		factors is measured in terms of the difference between grades
		of memberships of the same factors belonging to two or more
		sets under comparison. The required factors are classified
		under the following linguistic variables: Critical (CR);
		Conditioning (C); Little Conditioning (LC); and Irrelevant (I).
		And the alternatives can assume the following linguistic
		variables: Excellent (Ex), Good (G), Regular (R), Weak (W),
		Empty (Em), Zero (Z) and Inexistent (In). The model also
		provides flexibility, allowing different aggregation rules to
		be performed and defined by the Decision Maker. Such feature is
		considered in this package, allowing the user to define other
		aggregation matrices, since it considers the same linguistic
		variables mentioned.
