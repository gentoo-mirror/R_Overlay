		The Parameter Converter of the Pharmacokinetic Models //
		Pharmacokinetics is the study of drug absorption, distribution,
		metabolism, and excretion. The pharmacokinetics model explains
		that how the drug concentration change as the drug moves
		through the different compartments of the body. For
		pharmacokinetic modeling and analysis, it is essential to
		understand the basic pharmacokinetic parameters. All parameters
		are considered, but only some of parameters are used in the
		model. Therefore, we need to convert the estimated parameters
		to the other parameters after fitting the specific
		pharmacokinetic model. This package is developed to help this
		converting work. For more detailed explanation of
		pharmacokinetic parameters, see "Gabrielsson and Weiner"
