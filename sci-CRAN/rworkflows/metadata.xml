		Test, Document, Containerise, and Deploy R Packages //
		Reproducibility is essential to the progress of research, yet
		achieving it remains elusive even in computational fields.
		Continuous Integration (CI) platforms offer a powerful way to
		launch automated workflows to check and document code, but
		often require considerable time, effort, and technical
		expertise to setup. We therefore developed the rworkflows suite
		to make robust CI workflows easy and freely accessible to all R
		package developers. rworkflows consists of 1) a
		CRAN/Bioconductor-compatible R package template, 2) an R
		package to quickly implement a standardised workflow, and 3) a
		centrally maintained GitHub Action.
