		Computation of Genomic Signatures // Genomic signatures represent
		unique features within a species' DNA, enabling the
		differentiation of species and offering broad applications
		across various fields. This package provides essential tools
		for calculating these specific signatures, streamlining the
		process for researchers and offering a comprehensive and time-
		saving solution for genomic analysis.The amino acid contents
		are identified based on the work published by Sandberg et al.
		(2003) doi:10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00581-x and Xiao et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv042. The Average Mutual
		Information Profiles (AMIP) values are calculated based on the
		work of Bauer et al. (2008) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-48. The
		Chaos Game Representation (CGR) plot visualization was done
		based on the work of Deschavanne et al. (1999)
		doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026048 and Jeffrey et al.
		(1990) doi:10.1093/nar/18.8.2163. The GC content is calculated
		based on the work published by Nakabachi et al. (2006)
		doi:10.1126/science.1134196 and Barbu et al. (1956)
		https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13363015. The Oligonucleotide
		Frequency Derived Error Gradient (OFDEG) values are computed
		based on the work published by Saeed et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1186/1471-2164-10-S3-S10. The Relative Synonymous Codon
		Usage (RSCU) values are calculated based on the work published
		by Elek (2018) https://urn.nsk.hr/urn:nbn:hr:217:686131.
