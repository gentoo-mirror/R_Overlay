		Map Image Classification Efficacy // Map image classification
		efficacy (MICE) adjusts the accuracy rate relative to a random
		classification baseline (Shao et al.
		(2021)doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116526 and Tang et al.
		(2024)doi:10.1109/TGRS.2024.3446950). Only the proportions from
		the reference labels are considered, as opposed to the
		proportions from the reference and predictions, as is the case
		for the Kappa statistic. This package offers means to calculate
		MICE and adjusted versions of class-level user's accuracy
		(i.e., precision) and producer's accuracy (i.e., recall) and
		F1-scores. Class-level metrics are aggregated using macro-
		averaging. Functions are also made available to estimate
		confidence intervals using bootstrapping and statistically
		compare two classification results.
