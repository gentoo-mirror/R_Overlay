		Analysis of Metabolomics Data // Metabolomics data are inevitably
		subject to a component of unwanted variation, due to factors
		such as batch effects, matrix effects, and confounding
		biological variation. This package is a collection of functions
		designed to implement, assess, and choose a suitable
		normalization method for a given metabolomics study (De Livera
		et al (2015) doi:10.1021/ac502439y ).
