		Automatically Retrieve Multidimensional Distributed Data Sets //
		Tool to automatically fetch, transform and arrange subsets of
		multidimensional data sets (collections of files) stored in
		local and/or remote file systems or servers, using multicore
		capabilities where possible. The tool provides an interface to
		perceive a collection of data sets as a single large
		multidimensional data array, and enables the user to request
		for automatic retrieval, processing and arrangement of subsets
		of the large array. Wrapper functions to add support for custom
		file formats can be plugged in/out, making the tool suitable
		for any research field where large multidimensional data sets
		are involved.
