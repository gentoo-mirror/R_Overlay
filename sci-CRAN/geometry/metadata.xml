		Mesh Generation and Surface Tessellation // Makes the 'Qhull'
		library http://www.qhull.org available in R, in a similar
		manner as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull computes convex hulls,
		Delaunay triangulations, halfspace intersections about a point,
		Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay triangulations, and
		furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It runs in 2D, 3D, 4D, and
		higher dimensions. It implements the Quickhull algorithm for
		computing the convex hull. Qhull does not support constrained
		Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of non-convex
		objects, but the package does include some R functions that
		allow for this.
