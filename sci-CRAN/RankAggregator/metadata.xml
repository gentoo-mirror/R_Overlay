		Aggregation of (Partial) Ordinal Rankings // Easily compute an
		aggregate ranking (also called a median ranking or a consensus
		ranking) according to the axiomatic approach presented by Cook
		et al. (2007). This approach minimises the number of violations
		between all candidate consensus rankings and all input
		(partial) rankings, and draws on a branch and bound algorithm
		and a heuristic algorithm to drastically improve speed. The
		package also provides an option to bootstrap a consensus
		ranking based on resampling input rankings (with replacement).
		Input rankings can be either incomplete (partial) or complete.
