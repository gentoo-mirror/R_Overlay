		Rice Microarray Probe ID Conversion, from Probe ID to RAP-DB ID
		// Microarray probe ID is not convenient for further enrichment
		analysis and target gene selection. The package is created for
		the rice microarray probe ID conversion. This package can
		convert microarray probe ID from GPL6864
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL6864,
		GPL8852
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL8852, and
		GPL2025
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL2025
		platforms to RAP-DB ID. RAP-DB "The Rice Annotation Project
		Database" https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp is a well-known
		database for rice Oryza sativa, and the gene ID in this
		database is widely used in many areas related to rice research.
		For multiple probes representing a single gene, This package
		can merge them by taking the mean, max, or min value of these
		probes. Or we can keep multiple probes by appending sequence
		numbers to duplicate the RAP-DB ID.
