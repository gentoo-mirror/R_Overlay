		Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks //
		Bayesian network analysis is a form of probabilistic graphical
		models which derives from empirical data a directed acyclic
		graph, DAG, describing the dependency structure between  random
		variables. An additive Bayesian network model consists of a
		form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear
		model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to
		Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling,
		they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to
		multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help
		determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set,
		where these models are used to identify statistical
		dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation
		of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised
		linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random
		effects). The usual term to describe this model selection
		process is structure discovery. The core functionality is
		concerned with model selection - determining the most robust
		empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace
		approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and
		model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA
		package which can be obtained from http://www.r-inla.org. The
		computing library JAGS http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net is used
		to simulate 'abn'-like data. A comprehensive set of documented
		case studies, numerical accuracy/quality assurance exercises,
		and additional documentation are available from the 'abn'
		website http://r-bayesian-networks.org.
