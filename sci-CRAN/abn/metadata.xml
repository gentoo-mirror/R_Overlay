		Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks //
		The 'abn' R package facilitates Bayesian network analysis, a
		probabilistic graphical model that derives from empirical data
		a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This DAG describes the
		dependency structure between random variables. The R package
		'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian
		network models for a given data set. These models are used to
		identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. Their
		additive formulation is equivalent to multivariate generalised
		linear modelling, including mixed models with independent and
		identically distributed (iid) random effects. The core
		functionality of the 'abn' package revolves around model
		selection, also known as structure discovery. It supports both
		exact and heuristic structure learning algorithms and does not
		restrict the data distribution of parent-child combinations,
		providing flexibility in model creation and analysis. The 'abn'
		package uses Laplace approximations for metric estimation and
		includes wrappers to the 'INLA' package. It also employs 'JAGS'
		for data simulation purposes. For more resources and
		information, visit the 'abn' website.
