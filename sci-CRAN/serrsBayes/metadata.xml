		Bayesian Modelling of Raman Spectroscopy // Sequential Monte
		Carlo (SMC) algorithms for fitting a generalised additive mixed
		model (GAMM) to surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy
		(SERRS), using the method of Moores et al. (2016)
		arXiv:1604.07299. Multivariate observations of SERRS are highly
		collinear and lend themselves to a reduced-rank representation.
		The GAMM separates the SERRS signal into three components: a
		sequence of Lorentzian, Gaussian, or pseudo-Voigt peaks; a
		smoothly-varying baseline; and additive white noise. The
		parameters of each component of the model are estimated
		iteratively using SMC. The posterior distributions of the
		parameters given the observed spectra are represented as a
		population of weighted particles.
