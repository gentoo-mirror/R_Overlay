		Quantitative Analysis Made Accessible // This is a new version of
		the 'userfriendlyscience' package, which has grown a bit
		unwieldy. This first submission contains a number of basic
		functions to easily format values, work with scales, and format
		vectors in a single character value. Over time, more functions
		presently in 'userfriendlyscience' will be migrated over to
		this package.
