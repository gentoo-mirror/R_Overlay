		Quantitative Analysis Made Accessible // This is a new version of
		the 'userfriendlyscience' package, which has grown a bit
		unwieldy. Therefore, distinct functionalities are being
		'consciously uncoupled' into different packages. This package
		contains the general-purpose tools and utilities (see the
		'behaviorchange' and the 'rosetta' packages for other
		functionality), and is the most direct 'successor' of the
		original 'userfriendlyscience' package. For example, this
		package contains a number of basic functions to create higher
		level plots, such as diamond plots, to easily plot sampling
		distributions, to generate confidence intervals, to plan study
		sample sizes for confidence intervals, and to do some basic
		operations such as (dis)attenuate effect size estimates.
