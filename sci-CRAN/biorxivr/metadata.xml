		Search and Download Papers from the bioRxiv Preprint Server //
		The bioRxiv preprint server (https://www.biorxiv.org) is a
		website where scientists can post preprints of scholarly texts
		in biology. Users can search and download PDFs in bulk from the
		preprint server. The text of abstracts are stored as raw text
		within R, and PDFs can easily be saved and imported for text
		mining with packages such as 'tm'.
