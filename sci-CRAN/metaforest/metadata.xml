		Exploring Heterogeneity in Meta-Analysis using Random Forests //
		Conduct random forests-based meta-analysis, obtain partial
		dependence plots for metaforest and classic meta-analyses, and
		cross-validate and tune metaforest- and classic meta-analyses
		in conjunction with the caret package. A requirement of classic
		meta-analysis is that the studies being aggregated are
		conceptually similar, and ideally, close replications. However,
		in many fields, there is substantial heterogeneity between
		studies on the same topic. Classic meta-analysis lacks the
		power to assess more than a handful of univariate moderators.
		MetaForest, by contrast, has substantial power to explore
		heterogeneity in meta-analysis. It can identify important
		moderators from a larger set of potential candidates, even with
		as little as 20 studies (Van Lissa, in preparation). This is an
		appealing quality, because many meta-analyses have small sample
		sizes. Moreover, MetaForest yields a measure of variable
		importance which can be used to identify important moderators,
		and offers partial prediction plots to explore the shape of the
		marginal relationship between moderators and effect size.
