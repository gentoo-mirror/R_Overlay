		Exploring Heterogeneity in Meta-Analysis using Random Forests //
		A requirement of classic meta-analysis is that the studies
		being aggregated are conceptually similar, and ideally, close
		replications. However, in many fields, there is substantial
		heterogeneity between studies on the same topic. Similar
		research questions are studied in different laboratories, using
		different methods, instruments, and samples. Classic meta-
		analysis lacks the power to assess more than a handful of
		univariate moderators, or to investigate interactions between
		moderators, and non-linear effects. MetaForest, by contrast,
		has substantial power to explore heterogeneity in meta-
		analysis. It can identify important moderators from a larger
		set of potential candidates, even with as little as 20 studies
		(Van Lissa, in preparation). This is an appealing quality,
		because many meta-analyses have small sample sizes. Moreover,
		MetaForest yields a measure of variable importance which can be
		used to identify important moderators, and offers partial
		prediction plots to explore the shape of the marginal
		relationship between moderators and effect size.
