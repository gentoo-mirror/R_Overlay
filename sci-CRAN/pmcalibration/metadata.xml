		Calibration Curves for Clinical Prediction Models // Fit
		calibrations curves for clinical prediction models and
		calculate several associated metrics (Eavg, E50, E90, Emax).
		Ideally predicted probabilities from a prediction model should
		align with observed probabilities. Calibration curves relate
		predicted probabilities (or a transformation thereof) to
		observed outcomes via a flexible non-linear smoothing function.
		'pmcalibration' allows users to choose between several
		smoothers (regression splines, generalized additive
		models/GAMs, lowess, loess). Both binary and time-to-event
		outcomes are supported. See Van Calster et al. (2016)
