		Tools for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectra Alignment,
		Peak Based Processing, Quantitative Analysis and Visualizations
		// Makes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR
		spectroscopy) data analysis as easy as possible by only
		requiring a small set of functions to perform an entire
		analysis. 'speaq' offers the possibility of raw spectra
		alignment and quantitation but also an analysis based on
		features whereby the spectra are converted to peaks which are
		then grouped and turned into features. These features can be
		processed with any number of statistical tools either included
		in 'speaq' or available elsewhere on CRAN. More details can be
		found in Vu et al. (2011) doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-405 and
		Beirnaert et al. (2018) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006018.
