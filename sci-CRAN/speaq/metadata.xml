		Tools for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectra Alignment,
		Peak Based Processing, Quantitative Analysis and Visualizations
		// The speaq package is meant to make Nuclear Magnetic
		Resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) data analysis as easy
		as possible by only requiring a small set of functions to
		perform an entire analysis. speaq offers the possibility of raw
		spectra alignment and quantitation but also an analysis based
		on features whereby the spectra are converted to peaks which
		are then grouped and turned into features. These features can
		be processed with any number of statistical tools either
		included in speaq or available elsewhere on CRAN.
