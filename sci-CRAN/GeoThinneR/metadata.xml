		Simple Spatial Thinning for Ecological and Spatial Analysis //
		Provides efficient geospatial thinning algorithms to reduce the
		density of coordinate data while maintaining spatial
		relationships. Implements K-D Tree Approximate Nearest
		Neighbors (ANN), R-Tree, and brute force thinning methods. It
		uses a modified version of the R-tree structure from the
		'rtree' package https://github.com/akoyabio/rtree. The modified
		version can be downloaded from
		https://github.com/jmestret/rtree. For more information on the
		methods, see Elseberg et al. (2012)
