		Efficient Spatial Thinning of Species Occurrences // Provides
		efficient geospatial thinning algorithms to reduce the density
		of coordinate data while maintaining spatial relationships.
		Implements K-D Tree and brute-force distance-based thinning, as
		well as grid-based and precision-based thinning methods. For
		more information on the methods, see Elseberg et al. (2012)
