		Exploring and Testing the Toolchain and System Libraries // A
		collection of helper functions that interface with the
		appropriate system utilities to learn about the build
		environment. Lets you explore 'make' rules to test the local
		configuration, or query 'pkg-config' to find compiler flags and
		libs needed for building packages with external dependencies.
		Also contains tools to analyze which libraries that a installed
		R package linked to by inspecting output from 'ldd' in
		combination with information from your distribution package
		manager, e.g. 'rpm' or 'dpkg'. Finally the package provides
		Windows-specific utilities to automatically find or install the
		suitable version of the 'Rtools' build environment, and
		diagnose some common problems.
