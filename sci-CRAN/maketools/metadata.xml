		Exploring and Testing the Toolchain and System Libraries //
		Packages with C, C++, or Fortran code require a properly
		configured toolchain and sometimes external system dependencies
		to build. Because these things vary a lot by platform, getting
		this all to work can be challenging. The 'maketools' package
		contains a collection of helper functions that interface with
		the appropriate system utilities to learn about the build
		environment. It lets you explore 'make' rules to test the local
		configuration, or query 'pkg-config'
		https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/ to find
		the cflags and libs needed for building packages with external
		dependencies. It also contains tools to analyze which libraries
		that a installed R package is linked to, by inspecting output
		from 'ldd' https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html in
		combination with information from the distribution package
		manager, e.g. 'rpm' or 'dpkg'. For Windows there are special
		utilities to automatically find or install the suitable version
		of the 'Rtools' https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
		build environment, and diagnose some common problems.
