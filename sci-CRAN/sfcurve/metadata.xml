		2x2, 3x3 and Nxn Space-Filling Curves // Implementation of all
		possible forms of 2x2 and 3x3 space-filling curves, i.e., the
		generalized forms of the Hilbert curve
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve, the Peano curve
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve and the Peano curve
		in the meander type (Figure 5 in https://eudml.org/doc/141086).
		It can generates nxn curves expanded from any specific level-1
		units. It also implements the H-curve and the three-dimensional
		Hilbert curve.
