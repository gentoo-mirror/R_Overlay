		Determine Phytoplankton Functional Groups Based on Functional
		Traits // Functions designed to facilitate the assignment of
		morpho-functional group (MFG) classifications to phytoplankton
		species based on a combination of taxonomy (Class,Order) and a
		suite of 7 binomial functional traits. Classifications can also
		be made using only a species list and a database of trait-
		derived classifications included in the package. MFG
		classifications are derived from Salmaso et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1111/fwb.12520 and this reference should be cited when
		using the package. The 'algaeClassify' package is a product of
		the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on
		freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages),
		funded by CESAB (Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of
		Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center, with data
		and other support provided by members of GLEON (Global Lake
		Ecology Observation Network). This software is preliminary or
		provisional and is subject to revision. It is being provided to
		meet the need for timely best science. The software has not
		received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
		No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the
		U.S. Government as to the functionality of the software and
		related material nor shall the fact of release constitute any
		such warranty. The software is provided on the condition that
