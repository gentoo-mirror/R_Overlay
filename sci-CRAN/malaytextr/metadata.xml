		Text Mining for Bahasa Malaysia // It is designed to work with
		text written in Bahasa Malaysia. We provide functions and data
		sets that will make working with Bahasa Malaysia text much
		easier. For word stemming in particular, we will look up the
		Malay words in a dictionary and then proceed to remove "extra
		suffix" as explained in Khan, Rehman Ullah, Fitri Suraya
		Mohamad, Muh Inam UlHaq, Shahren Ahmad Zadi Adruce, Philip Nuli
		Anding, Sajjad Nawaz Khan, and Abdulrazak Yahya Saleh Al-Hababi
		(2017) https://ijrest.net/vol-4-issue-12.html . This package
		includes a dictionary of Malay words that may be used to
		perform word stemming, a dataset of Malay stop words, a dataset
		of sentiment words and a dataset of normalized words.
