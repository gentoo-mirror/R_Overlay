		Bayesian Network Learning Improved Project // Allows the user to
		learn Bayesian networks from datasets containing thousands of
		variables. It focuses on score-based learning, mainly the 'BIC'
		and the 'BDeu' score functions. It provides state-of-the-art
		algorithms for the following tasks: (1) parent set
		identification - Mauro Scanagatta (2015)
		http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5803-learning-bayesian-networks-
		with-thousands-of-variables; (2) general structure optimization
		- Mauro Scanagatta (2018) doi:10.1007/s10994-018-5701-9, Mauro
		Scanagatta (2018)
		http://proceedings.mlr.press/v73/scanagatta17a.html; (3)
		bounded treewidth structure optimization - Mauro Scanagatta
		(2016) http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6232-learning-treewidth-
		bounded-bayesian-networks-with-thousands-of-variables; (4)
		structure learning on incomplete data sets - Mauro Scanagatta
		(2018) doi:10.1016/j.ijar.2018.02.004. Distributed under the
		LGPL-3 by IDSIA.
