		Serialize R Objects to JSON, JavaScript Object Notation // This
		is a package that allows conversion to and from data in
		Javascript object notation (JSON) format. This allows R objects
		to be inserted into Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code and
		allows R programmers to read and convert JSON content to R
		objects. This is an alternative to rjson package. Originally,
		that was too slow for converting large R objects to JSON and
		was not extensible.  rjson's performance is now similar to this
		package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This
		package uses methods and is readily extensible by defining
		methods for different classes, vectorized operations, and C
		code and callbacks to R functions for deserializing JSON
		objects to R. The two packages intentionally share the same
		basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many additional
		options to allow customizing the generation and processing of
		JSON content. This package uses libjson rather than
		implementing yet another JSON parser. The aim is to support
		other general projects by building on their work, providing
		feedback and benefit from their ongoing development.
