		Relational Query Generator for Data Manipulation at Scale // A
		piped query generator based on Edgar F. Codd's relational
		algebra, and on production experience using 'SQL' and 'dplyr'
		at big data scale.  The design represents an attempt to make
		'SQL' more teachable by denoting composition by a sequential
		pipeline notation instead of nested queries or functions.   The
		implementation delivers reliable high performance data
		processing on large data systems such as 'Spark', databases,
		and 'data.table'. Package features include: data processing
		trees or pipelines as observable objects (able to report both
		columns produced and columns used), optimized 'SQL' generation
		as an explicit user visible modeling step, explicit query
		reasoning and checking.
