		Relational Query Generator for Data Manipulation at Scale // A
		'SQL' query generator based on Edgar F. Codd's relational
		algebra and experience using 'SQL' and 'dplyr' at big data
		scale.  The design represents an attempt to make 'SQL' more
		teachable by denoting composition by a sequential pipeline
		notation instead of nested queries or functions.   The
		implementation delivers reliable high performance data
		processing on large data systems such as `Spark` and databases.
		Package features include: data processing trees or pipelines as
		observable objects (able to report both columns produced and
		columns used), optimized 'SQL' generation as an explicit user
		visible modeling step, and convenience methods for applying
		query trees to in-memory 'data.frame's.
