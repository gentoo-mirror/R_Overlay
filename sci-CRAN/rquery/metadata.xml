		Relational Query Generator for Data Manipulation // A query
		generator based on Edgar F. Codd's relational algebra and
		operator names (plus experience using 'SQL' at big data scale).
		The design represents an attempt to make 'SQL' more teachable
		by denoting composition a sequential pipeline notation instead
		of nested queries or functions.  Package features include: data
		processing trees or pipelines as observable objects (able to
		report both columns produced and columns used), optimized 'SQL'
		generation as an explicit user visible modeling step, and
		convenience methods for applying query trees to in-memory
		'data.frame's.
