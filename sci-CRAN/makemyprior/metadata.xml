		Intuitive Construction of Joint Priors for Variance Parameters //
		Tool for easy prior construction and visualization. It helps to
		formulates joint prior distributions for variance parameters in
		latent Gaussian models. The resulting prior is robust and can
		be created in an intuitive way. A graphical user interface
		(GUI) can be used to choose the joint prior, where the user can
		click through the model and select priors. An extensive guide
		is available in the GUI. The package allows for direct
		inference with the specified model and prior. Using a
		hierarchical variance decomposition, we formulate a joint
		variance prior that takes the whole model structure into
		account. In this way, existing knowledge can intuitively be
		incorporated at the level it applies to. Alternatively, one can
		use independent variance priors for each model components in
		the latent Gaussian model. Details can be found in the
		accompanying scientific paper: Hem, Fuglstad, Riebler (2024,
		Journal of Statistical Software, doi:10.18637/jss.v110.i03).
