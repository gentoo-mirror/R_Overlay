		Simplified Simulations // Provides tools for generating and
		analyzing simulation studies. Users may easily specify all
		terms of a simulation study, often in a single line of code.
		Common univariate and bivariate methods, such as t tests,
		proportions tests, and chi squared tests, are integrated.
		Multivariate studies involving linear or logistic regression
		may also be specified with symbolic inputs. The simulation
		studies generate data for n observations in each of B
		experiments. Analyses of each experiment are integrated, and
		empirical results across the experiments are also provided.
