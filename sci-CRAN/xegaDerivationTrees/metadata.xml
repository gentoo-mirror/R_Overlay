		Generating and Manipulating Derivation Trees // Derivation tree
		operations are needed for implementing grammar-based genetic
		programming and grammatical evolution: Generating of a random
		derivation trees of a context-free grammar of bounded depth,
		decoding a derivation tree, choosing a random node in a
		derivation tree, extracting a tree whose root is a specified
		node, and inserting a subtree into a derivation tree at a
		specified node. These operations are necessary for the
		initializiation and for decoders of a random population of
		programs, as well as for implementing crossover and mutation
		operators. Depth-bounds are guaranteed by switching to a
		grammar without recursive production rules. For executing the
		examples, the package 'BNF' is needed. The basic tree
		operations of generating, extracting, and inserting of
		derivation trees as well as the conditions for guaranteeing
		complete derivation trees have been presented in Geyer-Schulz
		(1997, ISBN:978-3-7908-0830-X). The use of random integer
		vectors for the generation of derivation trees has been
		introduced in Ryan, C., Collins, J. J., and  O'Neill, M. (1998)
