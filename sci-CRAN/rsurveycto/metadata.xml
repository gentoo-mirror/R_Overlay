		Interact with Data on 'SurveyCTO' // 'SurveyCTO' is a platform
		for mobile data collection in offline settings. The
		'rsurveycto' R package uses the 'SurveyCTO' REST API
		https://docs.surveycto.com/05-exporting-and-publishing-
		data/05-api-access/01.api-access.html to read datasets and
		forms from a 'SurveyCTO' server into R as 'data.table's and to
		download file attachments. The package also has limited support
		to write datasets to a server.
