		Distribution Fitting and Evaluation // A library of density,
		distribution function, quantile function, (bounded) raw moments
		and random generation for a collection of distributions
		relevant for the firm size literature. Additionally, the
		package contains tools to fit these distributions using maximum
		likelihood and evaluate these distributions based on (i) log-
		likelihood ratio and (ii) deviations between the empirical and
		parametrically implied moments of the distributions. We add
		flexibility by allowing the considered distributions to be
		combined into piecewise composite or finite mixture
		distributions, as well as to be used when truncated. See
		Dewitte (2020) https://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-8644700 for a
		description and application of methods available in this
		package.
