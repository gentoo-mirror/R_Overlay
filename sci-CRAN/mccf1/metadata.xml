		Creates the MCC-F1 Curve and Calculates the MCC-F1 Metric and the
		Best Threshold // The MCC-F1 analysis is a method to evaluate
		the performance of binary classifications. The MCC-F1 curve is
		more reliable than the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
		curve and the Precision-Recall (PR)curve under imbalanced
		ground truth. The MCC-F1 analysis also provides the MCC-F1
		metric that integrates classifier performance over varying
		thresholds, and the best threshold of binary classification.
