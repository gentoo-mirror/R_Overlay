		Selection Response Analysis // This package (sra) provides a set
		of tools to analyse artificial-selection response datasets. The
		data typically feature for several generations the average
		value of a trait in a population, the variance of the trait,
		the population size and the average value of the parents that
		were chosen to breed. Sra implements two families of models
		aiming at describing the dynamics of the genetic architecture
		of the trait during the selection response. The first family
		relies on purely descriptive (phenomenological) models, based
		on an autoregressive framework. The second family provides
		different mechanistic models, accounting e.g. for inbreeding,
		mutations, genetic and environmental canalization, or
		epistasis. The parameters underlying the dynamics of the time
		series are estimated by maximum likelihood. The sra package
		thus provides (i) a wrapper for the R functions mle() and
		optim() aiming at fitting in a convenient way a predetermined
		set of models, and (ii) some functions to plot and analyze the
		output of the models.
