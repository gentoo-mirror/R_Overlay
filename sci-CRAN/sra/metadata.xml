		Selection Response Analysis // Artificial selection through
		selective breeding is an efficient way to induce changes in
		traits of interest in experimental populations. This package
		(sra) provides a set of tools to analyse artificial-selection
		response datasets. The data typically feature for several
		generations the average value of a trait in a population, the
		variance of the trait, the population size and the average
		value of the parents that were chosen to breed. Sra implements
		two families of models aiming at describing the dynamics of the
		genetic architecture of the trait during the selection
		response. The first family relies on purely descriptive
		(phenomenological) models, based on an autoregressive
		framework. The second family provides different mechanistic
		models, accounting e.g. for inbreeding, mutations, genetic and
		environmental canalization, or epistasis. The parameters
		underlying the dynamics of the time series are estimated by
		maximum likelihood. The sra package thus provides (i) a wrapper
		for the R functions mle() and optim() aiming at fitting in a
		convenient way a predetermined set of models, and (ii) some
		functions to plot and analyze the output of the models.
