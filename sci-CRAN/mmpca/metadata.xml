		Integrative Analysis of Several Related Data Matrices // A
		generalization of principal component analysis for integrative
		analysis. The method finds principal components that describe
		single matrices or that are common to several matrices. The
		solutions are sparse. Rank of solutions is automatically
		selected using cross validation. The method is described in
		Kallus et al. (2019) arXiv:1911.04927.
