		Penalized Quantile Regression with Fixed Effects // Quantile
		regression with fixed effects is a general model for
		longitudinal data. Here we proposed to solve it by several
		methods. The estimation methods include three loss functions as
		check, asymmetric least square and asymmetric Huber functions;
		and three structures as simple regression, fixed effects and
		fixed effects with penalized intercepts by LASSO.
