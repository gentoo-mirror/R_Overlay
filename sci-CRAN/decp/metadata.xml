		Implements the multiple change point detection methodology from
		Ryan  Killick (2023) doi:10.1080/00401706.2023.2183261 and a
		novel estimation methodology from Fotopoulos et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1007/s00362-023-01495-0 generalized to fit the detection
		methodologies. Performs both detection and estimation of change
		points, providing visualization and summary information of the
