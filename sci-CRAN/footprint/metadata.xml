		Calculate Air Travel Emissions // A handy tool to calculate
		carbon footprints from air travel based on three-letter
		International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport codes or
		latitude and longitude. footprint first calculates the great-
		circle distance between departure and arrival destinations. It
		then uses the Department of Environment, Food  Rural Affairs
		(DEFRA) greenhouse gas conversion factors for business air
		travel to estimate the carbon footprint. These conversion
		factors consider trip length, flight class (e.g. economy,
		business), and emissions metric (e.g. carbon dioxide
		equivalent, methane).
