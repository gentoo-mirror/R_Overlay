		experiment: R package for designing and analyzing randomized
		experiments // The package provides various statistical methods
		for designing and analyzing randomized experiments. One main
		functionality of the package is the implementation of
		randomized-block and matched-pair designs based on possibly
		multivariate pre-treatment covariates. The package also
		provides the tools to analyze various randomized experiments
		including cluster randomized experiments, randomized
		experiments with noncompliance, and randomized experiments with
		missing data.
