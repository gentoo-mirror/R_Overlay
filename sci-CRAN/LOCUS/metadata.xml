		Low-Rank Decomposition of Brain Connectivity Matrices with
		Uniform Sparsity // To decompose symmetric matrices such as
		brain connectivity matrices so that one can extract sparse
		latent component matrices and also estimate mixing
		coefficients, a blind source separation (BSS) method named
		LOCUS was proposed in Wang and Guo (2023) arXiv:2008.08915. For
		brain connectivity matrices, the outputs correspond to sparse
		latent connectivity traits and individual-level trait loadings.
