		Generalized Pair Hidden Markov Chain Model for Sequence Alignment
		// Implementation of a generalized pair hidden Markov chain
		model (GPHMM) that can be used to compute the probability of
		alignment between two sequences of nucleotides (e.g., a
		reference sequence and a noisy sequenced read). The model can
		be trained on a dataset where the noisy sequenced reads are
		known to have been sequenced from known reference sequences. If
		no training sets are available default parameters can be used.
