		Normal aka Gaussian (1-d) Mixture Models (S3 Classes and Methods)
		// Onedimensional Normal (i.e. Gaussian) Mixture Models
		Classes, for, e.g., density estimation or clustering algorithms
		research and teaching; providing the widely used Marron-Wand
		densities.  Efficient random number generation and graphics.
		Fitting to data by efficient ML (Maximum Likelihood) or
		traditional EM estimation.
