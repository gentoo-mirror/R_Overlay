		User-Friendly R Interface to Biologic Web Services' API //
		Currently fully supports miEAA, PANTHER, Reactome, STRING, and
		UniProt! The goal of rbioapi is to provide a user-friendly and
		consistent interface to biological databases and services; It
		is designed in a way that insulates the user from
		technicalities when it comes to using API services and creates
		a unified and easy-to-implement tool to connect to biological
		databases and services. With rbioapi, You are not required to
		have any prior technical knowledge. Just fill in a function's
		arguments and the rest is handled for you. This an ongoing
		project. New databases and services will be implemented
		periodically to gradually make rbioapi more comprehensive. Feel
		free to suggest any databases or services you often use.
