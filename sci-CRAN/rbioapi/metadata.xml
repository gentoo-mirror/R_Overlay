		User-Friendly R Interface to Biologic Web Services' API //
		Currently fully supports Enrichr, JASPAR, miEAA, PANTHER,
		Reactome, STRING, and UniProt! The goal of rbioapi is to
		provide a user-friendly and consistent interface to biological
		databases and services. In a way that insulates the user from
		the technicalities of using web services API and creates a
		unified and easy-to-use interface to biological and medical web
		services. This is an ongoing project; New databases and
		services will be added periodically. Feel free to suggest any
		databases or services you often use.
