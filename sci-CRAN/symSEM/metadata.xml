		Symbolic Computation for Structural Equation Models // A
		collection of functions for symbolic computation using the
		'caracas' package for structural equation models and other
		statistical analyses. Among its features is the ability to
		calculate the model-implied covariance (and correlation) matrix
		and the sampling covariance matrix of variable functions using
		the delta method.
