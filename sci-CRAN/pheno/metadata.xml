		Auxiliary Functions for Phenological Data Analysis // Provides
		some easy-to-use functions for time series analyses of (plant-)
		phenological data sets. These functions mainly deal with the
		estimation of combined phenological time series and are usually
		wrappers for functions that are already implemented in other R
		packages adapted to the special structure of phenological data
		and the needs of phenologists. Some date conversion functions
		to handle Julian dates are also provided.
