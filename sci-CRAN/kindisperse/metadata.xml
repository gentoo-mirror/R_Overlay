		Simulate and Estimate Close-Kin Dispersal Kernels // Functions
		for simulating and estimating kinship-related dispersal. Based
		on the methods described in M. Jasper, T.L. Schmidt., N.W.
		Ahmad, S.P. Sinkins  A.A. Hoffmann (2019)
		doi:10.1111/1755-0998.13043 "A genomic approach to inferring
		kinship reveals limited intergenerational dispersal in the
		yellow fever mosquito". Assumes an additive variance model of
		dispersal in two dimensions, compatible with Wright's
		neighbourhood area. Simple and composite dispersal simulations
		are supplied, as well as the functions needed to estimate
		parent-offspring dispersal for simulated or empirical data, and
		to undertake sampling design for future field studies of
		dispersal. For ease of use an integrated Shiny app is also
		included.
