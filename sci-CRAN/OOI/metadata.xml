		Outside Option Index // Calculates the Outside Option Index
		proposed by Caldwell and Danieli (2018) https://drive.google.co
		m/file/d/1j-uwD19S4gqgXIXeYch9jGBCaDhWZlRQ/view. This index
		uses the cross- sectional concentration of similar workers
		across job types to quantify the availability of outside
		options as a function of workers characteristics (e.g.
		commuting costs, preferences, and skills.)
