		Providing Interactive Interpretations and Explanations of
		Statistical Results // Allows to provide live interpretations
		and explanations of statistical functions in R. These
		interpretations and explanations are shown when the explained
		function is called by the user. They can interact with the
		values of the explained function's actual results to offer
		relevant, meaningful insights. The 'xplain' interpretations and
		explanations are based on an easy-to-use XML format that allows
		to include R code to interact with the returns of the explained
		function.
