		Differential Network Analysis using Gene Pathways // Integrates
		pathway information into the differential network analysis of
		two gene expression datasets as described in Grimes, Potter,
		and Datta (2019) doi:10.1038/s41598-019-41918-3. Provides
		summary functions to break down the results at the pathway,
		gene, or individual connection level. The differential networks
		for each pathway of interest can be plotted, and the
		visualization will highlight any differentially expressed genes
		and all of the gene-gene associations that are significantly
		differentially connected.
