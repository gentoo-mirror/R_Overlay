		Heuristics for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) //
		Implements heuristics for the Quadratic Assignment Problem
		(QAP). Although, the QAP was introduced as a combinatorial
		optimization problem for the facility location problem in
		operations research, it also has many applications in data
		analysis. The problem is NP-hard and the package implements a
		simulated annealing heuristic.
