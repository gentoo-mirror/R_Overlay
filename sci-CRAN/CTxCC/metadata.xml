		Multivariate Normal Mean Monitoring Through Critical-to-X Control
		Chart // A comprehensive set of functions designed for
		multivariate mean monitoring using the Critical-to-X Control
		Chart. These functions enable the determination of optimal
		control limits based on a specified in-control Average Run
		Length (ARL), the calculation of out-of-control ARL for a given
		control limit, and post-signal analysis to identify the
		specific variable responsible for a detected shift in the mean.
		This suite of tools provides robust support for precise and
		effective process monitoring and analysis.
