		Calculates Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments // Calculates a
		number of valuation adjustments including CVA, DVA, FBA, FCA,
		MVA and KVA. A two-way margin agreement has been implemented.
		For the KVA calculation three regulatory frameworks are
		supported: CEM, (simplified) SA-CCR, OEM and IMM. The
		probability of default is implied through the credit spreads
		curve. The package supports an exposure calculation based on
		SA-CCR which includes several trade types and a simulated path
		which is currently available only for IRSwaps. The latest
		regulatory capital charge methodologies have been implementing
		including BA-CVA  SA-CVA.
