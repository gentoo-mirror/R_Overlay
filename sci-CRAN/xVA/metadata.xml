		Calculates Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments // Calculates a
		number of valuation adjustments including CVA, DVA, FBA, FCA,
		MVA and KVA. A two-way margin agreement has been implemented.
		For the KVA calculation three regulatory frameworks are
		supported: CEM, (simplified) SA-CCR, OEM and IMM. The
		probability of default is implied through the credit spreads
		curve. Currently, only IRSwaps are supported. For more
		information, you can check one of the books regarding xVA:
