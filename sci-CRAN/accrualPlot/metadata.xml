		Accrual Plots and Predictions for Clinical Trials // Tracking
		accrual in clinical trials is important for trial success. If
		accrual is too slow, the trial will take too long and be too
		expensive. If accrual is much faster than expected, time
		sensitive tasks such as the writing of statistical analysis
		plans might need to be rushed. 'accrualPlot' provides functions
		to aid the tracking of accrual and predict when a trial will
		reach it's intended sample size.
