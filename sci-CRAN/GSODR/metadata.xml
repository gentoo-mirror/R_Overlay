		Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) Weather Data from R //
		Provides automated downloading, parsing, cleaning, unit
		conversion and formatting of Global Surface Summary of the Day
		(GSOD) weather data from the from the USA National Centers for
		Environmental Information (NCEI) for use in R.  Units are
		converted from from United States Customary System (USCS) units
		to International System of Units (SI).  Stations may be
		individually checked for number of missing days defined by the
		user, where stations with too many missing observations are
		omitted.  Only stations with valid reported latitude and
		longitude values are permitted in the final data.  Additional
		useful elements, saturation vapour pressure (es), actual vapour
		pressure (ea) and relative humidity are calculated from the
		original data and included in the final data set.  The
		resulting data include station identification information,
		state, country, latitude, longitude, elevation, weather
		observations and associated flags.  Data may be automatically
		saved to disk. File output may be returned as a comma-separated
		values (CSV) or GeoPackage (GPKG) file.  Additional data are
		included with this R package: a list of elevation values for
		stations between -60 and 60 degrees latitude derived from the
		Shuttle Radar Topography Measuring Mission (SRTM).  For
		information on the GSOD data from NCEI, please see the  GSOD
		readme.txt file available from,
		http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt.
