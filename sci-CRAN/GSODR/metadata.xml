		Global Summary Daily Weather Data in R // Provides automated
		downloading, parsing, cleaning, unit conversion and formatting
		of Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) weather data from
		the from the USA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for use
		in R. All units are converted from from United States Customary
		System (USCS) units to International System of Units (SI).
		Stations may be individually checked for number of missing days
		defined by the user, where stations with too many missing
		observations are omitted. Only stations with valid reported
		latitude and longitude values are permitted in the final data.
		Additional useful variables, saturation vapour pressure (es),
		actual vapour pressure (ea) and relative humidity are
		calculated from the original data and included in the final
		data set. The resulting data include station identification
		information, state, country, latitude, longitude, elevation,
		weather observations and associated flags. Data may be
		automatically saved to disk. File output may be returned as a
		comma-separated values (CSV) or GeoPackage (GPKG) file.
		Additional data are included with this R package: a list of
		elevation values for stations between -60 and 60 degrees
		latitude derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Measuring
		Mission (SRTM). For information on the GSOD data from NCDC,
		please see the  GSOD readme.txt file available from,
		http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt.
