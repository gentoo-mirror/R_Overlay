		Global Surface Summary of the Day ('GSOD') Weather Data Client //
		Provides automated downloading, parsing, cleaning, unit
		conversion and formatting of Global Surface Summary of the Day
		('GSOD') weather data from the from the USA National Centers
		for Environmental Information ('NCEI').  Units are converted
		from from United States Customary System ('USCS') units to
		International System of Units ('SI').  Stations may be
		individually checked for number of missing days defined by the
		user, where stations with too many missing observations are
		omitted.  Only stations with valid reported latitude and
		longitude values are permitted in the final data.  Additional
		useful elements, saturation vapour pressure ('es'), actual
		vapour pressure ('ea') and relative humidity ('RH') are
		calculated from the original data using the improved August-
		Roche-Magnus approximation (Alduchov  Eskridge 1996) and
		included in the final data set.  The resulting metadata include
		station identification information, country, state, latitude,
		longitude, elevation, weather observations and associated
		flags.  For information on the 'GSOD' data from 'NCEI', please
		see the 'GSOD' 'readme.txt' file available from,
		https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt.
