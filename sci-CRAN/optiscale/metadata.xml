		Optimal Scaling // Optimal scaling of a data vector, relative to
		a set of targets, is obtained through a least-squares
		transformation subject to appropriate measurement constraints.
		The targets are usually predicted values from a statistical
		model. If the data are nominal level, then the transformation
		must be identity-preserving. If the data are ordinal level,
		then the transformation must be monotonic. If the data are
		discrete, then tied data values must remain tied in the optimal
		transformation. If the data are continuous, then tied data
		values can be untied in the optimal transformation.
