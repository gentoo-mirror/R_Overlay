		Stable Specification Search in Structural Equation Models // An
		exploratory and heuristic approach for specification search in
		Structural Equation Modeling. The basic idea is to subsample
		the original data and then search for optimal models on each
		subset. Optimality is defined through two objectives: model fit
		and parsimony. As these objectives are conflicting, we apply a
		multi-objective optimization methods, specifically NSGA-II, to
		obtain optimal models for the whole range of model
		complexities. From these optimal models, we consider only the
		relevant model specifications (structures), i.e., those that
		are both stable (occur frequently) and parsimonious and use
		those to infer a causal model.
