		Satellite Derived Water Quality Detection Algorithms // The goal
		of 'waterquality' is to convert satellite-reflectance imagery
		to a host of pre-defined water quality algorithms designed for
		the detection of chlorophyll-a, blue-green algae (Phycocyanin),
		and turbidity. This package is able to process the following
		sensor configurations: WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8,
		MODIS, and MERIS.
