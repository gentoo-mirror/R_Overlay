		GSL Multi-Start Nonlinear Least-Squares Fitting // An R interface
		to weighted nonlinear least-squares optimization with the GNU
		Scientific Library (GSL), see M. Galassi et al. (2009,
		ISBN:0954612078). The available trust region methods include
		the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with and without geodesic
		acceleration, the Steihaug-Toint conjugate gradient algorithm
		for large systems and several variants of Powell's dogleg
		algorithm. Multi-start optimization based on quasi-random
		samples is implemented using a modified version of the
		algorithm in Hickernell and Yuan (1997, OR Transactions).
		Robust nonlinear regression can be performed using various
		robust loss functions, in which case the optimization problem
		is solved by iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS).
		Bindings are provided to tune a number of parameters affecting
		the low-level aspects of the trust region algorithms. The
		interface mimics R's nls() function and returns model objects
		inheriting from the same class.
