		Bayesian Group Sparse Multi-Task Regression // Implementation of
		Bayesian multi-task regression models and was developed within
		the context of imaging genetics. The package can currently fit
		two models. The Bayesian group sparse multi-task regression
		model of Greenlaw et al.
		(2017)doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx215 can be fit with
		implementation using Gibbs sampling. An extension of this model
		developed by Song, Ge et al. to accommodate both spatial
		correlation as well as correlation across brain hemispheres can
		also be fit using either mean-field variational Bayes or Gibbs
		sampling. The model can also be used more generally for
		multivariate (non-imaging) phenotypes with spatial correlation.
