		Bayesian Group Sparse Multi-Task Regression // Fits a Bayesian
		group-sparse multi-task regression model using Gibbs sampling.
		The hierarchical prior encourages shrinkage of the estimated
		regression coefficients at both the gene and SNP level. The
		model has been extended to a spatial model that allows for two
		type correlation in neuroimaging genetics data and been applied
		successfully to imaging phenotypes of dimension up to 100; it
		can be used more generally for multivariate (non-imaging)
		phenotypes.
