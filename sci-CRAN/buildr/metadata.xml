		Comfort Way to Run Build Scripts // Working with reproducible
		reports or any other similar projects often requires to run the
		script that builds the output file in a specified way. One can
		become tired from repeatedly switching to the build script and
		sourcing it. The 'buildr' package does this one simple thing
		via 'RStudio' addin  user can set up the keyboard shortcut and
		run the build script with one keystroke anywhere anytime. The
		second way is to pass buildr() command to console which does
		the same thing. Both ways source the build.R (case insensitive)
		file present in the current working directory.
