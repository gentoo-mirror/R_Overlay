		Latent Variable Model to Infer Food Intake from Multiple
		Biomarkers // A latent variable model based on factor analytic
		and mixture of experts models, designed to infer food intake
		from multiple biomarkers data. The model is framed within a
		Bayesian hierarchical framework, which provides flexibility to
		adapt to different biomarker distributions and facilitates
		inference on food intake from biomarker data alone, along with
		the associated uncertainty. Details are in D'Angelo, et al.
		(2020) arXiv:2006.02995.
