		Linear and Non-Linear AUC for Discounting Data // Area under the
		curve (AUC; Myerson et al., 2001) doi:10.1901/jeab.2001.76-235
		is a popular measure used in discounting research. Although the
		calculation of AUC is standardized, there are differences in
		AUC based on some assumptions. For example, Myerson et al.
		(2001) doi:10.1901/jeab.2001.76-235 assumed that (with delay
		discounting data) a researcher would impute an indifference
		point at zero delay equal to the value of the larger, later
		outcome. However, this practice is not clearly followed. This
		imputed zero-delay indifference point plays an important role
		in log and ordinal versions of AUC. Ordinal and log versions of
		AUC are described by Borges et al. (2016)doi:10.1002/jeab.219.
		The package can calculate all three versions of AUC [and
		includes a new version: IHS(AUC)], impute indifference points
		when x = 0, calculate ordinal AUC in the case of Halton
		sampling of x-values, and account for probability discounting
		AUC.
