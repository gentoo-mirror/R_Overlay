		Computes  Plots Compatibility (Confidence), Surprisal,
		Likelihood Distributions // Computes compatibility (confidence)
		distributions along with their corresponding P-values,
		S-values, and likelihoods. The intervals can be plotted to form
		the distributions themselves. Functions can be compared to one
		another to see how much they overlap. Results can be exported
		to Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and TeX documents. The package
		currently supports resampling methods, computing differences,
		generalized linear models, mixed-effects models, survival
		analysis, and meta-analysis. These methods are discussed by
		Schweder T, Hjort NL. (2016, ISBN:9781316445051) and Rafi Z,
		Greenland S. (2020) doi:10.1186/s12874-020-01105-9.
