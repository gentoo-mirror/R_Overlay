		Computes and Plots Compatibility (Confidence) Intervals,
		P-Values, S-Values,  Likelihood Intervals to Form Consonance,
		Surprisal,  Likelihood Functions // Allows one to compute
		compatibility (confidence) intervals for various statistical
		tests along with their corresponding P-values, S-values, and
		likelihoods. The intervals can be plotted to create consonance,
		surprisal, and likelihood functions allowing one to see what
		effect sizes are compatible with the test model at various
		compatibility levels rather than being limited to one interval
		estimate such as 95\%. Functions can also be compared to one
		another to see how much they overlap with one another and
		differ. Results can also be exported for Word, Powerpoint, and
		TeX documents. The package currently supports bootstrapping,
		linear models, generalized linear models, linear mixed-effects
		models, survival analysis, and meta-analysis. These methods are
		discussed by Poole C. (1987) doi:10.2105/AJPH.77.2.195,
