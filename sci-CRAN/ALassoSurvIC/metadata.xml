		Adaptive Lasso for the Cox Regression with Interval Censored and
		Possibly Left Truncated Data // Penalized variable selection
		tools for the Cox proportional hazards model with interval
		censored and possibly left truncated data. It performs variable
		selection via penalized nonparametric maximum likelihood
		estimation with an adaptive lasso penalty. The optimal
		thresholding parameter can be searched by the package based on
		the profile Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The
		asymptotic validity of the methodology is established in Li et
		al. (2019 doi:10.1177/0962280219856238). The unpenalized
		nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation for interval
		censored and possibly left truncated data is also available.
