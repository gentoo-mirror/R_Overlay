		Modern Classes for Tracking and Movement Data // Modern classes
		for tracking and movement data, building on 'sf' spatial
		infrastructure, and early theoretical work from Turchin (1998,
		ISBN: 9780878938476), and Calenge et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2008.10.002. Tracking data are series of
		locations with at least 2-dimensional spatial coordinates
		(x,y), a time index (t), and individual identification (id) of
		the object being monitored; movement data are made of
		trajectories, i.e. the line representation of the path,
		composed by steps (the straight-line segments connecting
		successive locations). 'sftrack' is designed to handle movement
		of both living organisms and inanimate objects.
