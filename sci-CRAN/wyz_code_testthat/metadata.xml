		Wizardry Code Offensive Programming Test Generation // Allows to
		generate automatically 'testthat' code files from offensive
		programming test cases. Generated test files are complete and
		ready to run. Using 'wyz.code.testthat' you will earn a lot of
		time, reduce the number of errors in test case production, be
		able to test immediately generated files without any need to
		view or modify them, and enter a zero time latency between code
		implementation and industrial testing. As with 'testthat', you
		may complete provided test cases according to your needs to
		push testing further, but this need is nearly void when using
		'wyz.code.offensiveProgramming'. Refer to chapter 9 of
		Offensive Programming Book, Fabien GELINEAU (2019,
		ISBN:979-10-699-4075-8), to learn about details and get value
		from this package.
