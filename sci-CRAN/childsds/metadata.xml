		Data and Methods Around Reference Values in Pediatrics //
		Calculation of standard deviation scores adduced from different
		growth standards (WHO, UK, Germany, Italy, China, etc).
		Therefore, the calculation of SDS-values for different measures
		like BMI, weight, height, head circumference, different ratios,
		etc. are easy to carry out. Also, references for laboratory
		values in children are available: serum lipids, iron-related
		blood parameters. In the new version, there are also functions
		combining the lms() function from package 'gamlss' with
		resampling methods for using with repeated measurements and
		family dependencies.
