		Data and Methods Around Reference Values in Pediatrics //
		Calculation of standard deviation scores and percentiles
		adduced from different growth standards (WHO, UK, Germany,
		Italy, China, etc). Therefore, the calculation of SDS-values
		for different measures like BMI, weight, height, head
		circumference, different ratios, etc. are easy to carry out.
		Also, references for laboratory values in children and adults
		are available, e.g., serum lipids, iron-related blood
		parameters, IGF, liver enzymes. In the new version, there are
		also functions combining the lms() function from package
		'gamlss' with resampling methods for using with repeated
		measurements and family dependencies. A searchable list of
		items can be found here:
