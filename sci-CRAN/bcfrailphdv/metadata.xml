		Bivariate Correlated Frailty Models with Varied Variances // Fit
		and simulate bivariate correlated frailty models with
		proportional hazard structure. Frailty distributions, such as
		gamma and lognormal models are supported. Frailty variances of
		the two subjects can be varied or equal. Details on the models
		are available in book of Wienke (2011,ISBN:978-1-4200-7388-1).
		Bivariate gamma fit is obtained using the approach given in
		Iachine (1995) with modifications. Lognormal fit is based on
		the approach by Ripatti and Palmgren (2000)
		doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.01016.x. Univariate and bivariate
		shared gamma frailty model fits are possible. Standard errors
		of the estimated covariate coefficients and frailty variance
		parameter are obtained using the approach given in Klein and
		Moeschberger (2003,ISBN:0-387-95399-X).
