		Rectangle Nested Lists // A tool to rectangle a nested list, that
		is to convert it into a tibble. This is done automatically or
		according to a given specification.  A common use case is for
		nested lists coming from parsing JSON files or the JSON
		response of REST APIs. It is supported by the 'vctrs' package
		and therefore offers a wide support of vector types.
