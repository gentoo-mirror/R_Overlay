		Nitrogen Use Efficiency Toolkit on Numerics // Comprehensive R
		package designed to facilitate the calculation of Nitrogen Use
		Efficiency (NUE) indicators using experimentally derived data.
		The package incorporates 23 parameters categorized into six
		fertilizer-based, four plant-based, three soil-based, three
		isotope-based, two ecology-based, and four system-based
		indicators, providing a versatile platform for NUE assessment.
		As of the current version, 'NUETON' serves as a starting point
		for users to compute NUE indicators from their experimental
		data. Future updates are planned to enhance the package's
		capabilities, including robust data visualization tools and
		error margin consideration in calculations. Additionally,
		statistical methods will be integrated to ensure the accuracy
		and reliability of the calculated indicators. All formulae used
		in 'NUETON' are thoroughly referenced within the source code,
		and the package is released as open source software. Users are
		encouraged to provide feedback and contribute to the
		improvement of this package. It is important to note that the
		current version of 'NUETON' is not intended for rigorous
		research purposes, and users are responsible for validating
		their results. The package developers do not assume liability
		for any inaccuracies in calculations. This package includes
		content from Congreves KA, Otchere O, Ferland D, Farzadfar S,
		Williams S and Arcand MM (2021) 'Nitrogen Use Efficiency
		Definitions of Today and Tomorrow.' Front. Plant Sci.
