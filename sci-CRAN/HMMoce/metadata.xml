		Improved Analysis of Marine Animal Movement Data Using Hidden
		Markov Models // Improved analysis of marine animal movement
		data by implementing a state-space hidden Markov model (HMM) to
		improve position estimates. Position estimates are derived by
		comparing electronic tag data (from tags deployed on marine
		animals, typically fish) to three-dimensional oceanographic
		data.
