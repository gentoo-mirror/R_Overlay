		Unsupervised Gaussian Mixture and Minkowski and Spherical K-Means
		with Constraints // High performance trainers for
		parameterizing and clustering weighted data. The Gaussian
		mixture (GM) module includes the conventional EM (expectation
		maximization) trainer, the component-wise EM trainer, the
		minimum-message-length EM trainer by Figueiredo and Jain (2002)
		doi:10.1109/34.990138. These trainers accept additional
		constraints on mixture weights, covariance eigen ratios and on
		which mixture components are subject to update. The K-means
		(KM) module offers clustering with the options of (i)
		deterministic and stochastic K-means++ initializations, (ii)
		upper bounds on cluster weights (sizes), (iii) Minkowski
		distances, (iv) cosine dissimilarity, (v) dense and sparse
		representation of data input. The package improved the typical
		implementations of GM and KM algorithms in various aspects. It
		is carefully crafted in multithreaded C++ for modeling large
		data for industry use.
