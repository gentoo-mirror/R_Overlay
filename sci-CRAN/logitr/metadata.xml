		Logit Models w/Preference  WTP Space Utility Parameterizations //
		Fast estimation of multinomial (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL)
		models in R. Models can be estimated using "Preference" space
		or "Willingness-to-pay" (WTP) space utility parameterizations.
		Weighted models can also be estimated. An option is available
		to run a multistart optimization loop with random starting
		points in each iteration, which is useful for non-convex
		problems like MXL models or models with WTP space utility
		parameterizations. The main optimization loop uses the 'nloptr'
		package to minimize the negative log-likelihood function.
		Additional functions are available for computing and comparing
		WTP from both preference space and WTP space models and for
		predicting expected choices and choice probabilities for sets
		of alternatives based on an estimated model. MXL models assume
		uncorrelated heterogeneity covariances and are estimated using
		maximum simulated likelihood based on the algorithms in Train
