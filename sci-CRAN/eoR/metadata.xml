		Data Management Package (Exposure and Occurrence Data in R) //
		This data management package provides some helper classes for
		publicly available data sources (HMD, DESTATIS) in Demography.
		Similar to ideas developed in the Bioconductor project
		https://bioconductor.org we strive to encapsulate data in easy
		to use S4 objects. If original data is provided in a text file,
		the resulting S4 object contains all information from that text
		file. But the information is somehow structured (header,
		footer, etc). Further the classes provide methods to make a
		subset for selected calendar years or selected regions. The
		resulting subset objects still contain the original header and
		footer information.
