		Rare Event Meta Analysis // The rema package implements a
		permutation-based approach for binary meta-analyses of 2x2
		tables, founded on conditional logistic regression, that
		provides more reliable statistical tests when heterogeneity is
		observed in rare event data (Zabriskie et al. 2021
		doi:10.1002/sim.9142). To adjust for the effect of
		heterogeneity, this method conditions on the sufficient
		statistic of a proxy for the heterogeneity effect as opposed to
		estimating the heterogeneity variance. While this results in
		the model not strictly falling under the random-effects
		framework, it is akin to a random-effects approach in that it
		assumes differences in variability due to treatment. Further,
		this method does not rely on large-sample approximations or
		continuity corrections for rare event data. This method uses
		the permutational distribution of the test statistic instead of
		asymptotic approximations for inference. The number of observed
		events drives the computation complexity for creating this
		permutational distribution. Accordingly, for this method to be
		computationally feasible, it should only be applied to meta-
		analyses with a relatively low number of observed events. To
		create this permutational distribution, a network algorithm,
		based on the work of Mehta et al. (1992) doi:10.2307/1390598
		and Corcoran et al. (2001)
		doi:10.1111/j.0006-341x.2001.00941.x, is employed using C++ and
		integrated into the package.
