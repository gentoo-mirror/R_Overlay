		Goodness of Fit Tests Based on Empirical Distribution Functions
		// Routines that allow the user to run goodness of fit tests
		based on empirical distribution functions for formal model
		evaluation in a general likelihood model. In addition,
		functions are provided to test a sample against Normal or Gamma
		distributions, validate the normality assumptions in a linear
		model, and examine the appropriateness of a Gamma distribution
		in generalized linear models with various link functions.
