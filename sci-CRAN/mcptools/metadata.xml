		Model Context Protocol Servers and Clients // Implements the
		Model Context Protocol (MCP). Users can start 'R'-based
		servers, serving functions as tools for large language models
		to call before responding to the user in MCP-compatible apps
		like 'Claude Desktop' and 'Claude Code', with options to run
		those tools inside of interactive 'R' sessions. On the  other
		end, when 'R' is the client via the 'ellmer' package, users can
		register tools from third-party MCP servers to integrate
		additional context into chats.
