		Alpha-NOMINATE Ideal Point Estimator // Provides functions to
		estimate and interpret the alpha-NOMINATE ideal point model
		developed in Carroll et al. (2013, doi:10.1111/ajps.12029).
		alpha-NOMINATE extends traditional spatial voting frameworks by
		allowing for a mixture of Gaussian and quadratic utility
		functions, providing flexibility in modeling political actors'
		preferences. The package uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		methods for parameter estimation, supporting robust inference
		about individuals' ideological positions and the shape of their
		utility functions. It also contains functions to simulate data
		from the model and to calculate the probability of a vote
		passing given the ideal points of the legislators/voters and
		the estimated location of the choice alternatives.
