		Navigated Weighting for the Inverse Probability Weighting //
		Implements the navigated weighting (NAWT) proposed by Katsumata
		(2020) arXiv:2005.10998, which improves the inverse probability
		weighting by utilizing estimating equations suitable for a
		specific pre-specified parameter of interest (e.g., the average
		treatment effects or the average treatment effects on the
		treated) in propensity score estimation. It includes the
		covariate balancing propensity score proposed by Imai and
		Ratkovic (2014) doi:10.1111/rssb.12027, which uses covariate
		balancing conditions in propensity score estimation. The point
		estimate of the parameter of interest as well as coefficients
		for propensity score estimation and their uncertainty are
		produced using the M-estimation. The same functions can be used
		to estimate average outcomes in missing outcome cases.
