		Calculates Composite Index // It uses the first-order sensitivity
		index to measure whether the weights assigned by the creator of
		the composite indicator match the actual importance of the
		variables. Moreover, the variance inflation factor is used to
		reduce the set of correlated variables. In the case of a
		discrepancy between the importance and the assigned weight, the
		script determines weights that allow adjustment of the weights
		to the intended impact of variables. If the optimised weights
		are unable to reflect the desired importance, the highly
		correlated variables are reduced, taking into account variance
		inflation factor. The final outcome of the script is the
		calculated value of the composite indicator based on optimal
		weights and a reduced set of variables, and the linear ordering
		of the analysed objects.
