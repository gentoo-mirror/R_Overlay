		Importing Interlinearized Corpora and Dictionaries as Produced by
		Descriptive Linguistics Software // Interlinearized glossed
		texts (IGT) are used in descriptive linguistics for
		representing a morphological analysis of a text through a
		morpheme-by-morpheme gloss. 'InterlineaR' provide a set of
		functions that targets several popular formats of IGT ('SIL
		Toolbox', 'EMELD XML') and that turns an IGT into a set of data
		frames following a relational model (the tables represent the
		different linguistic units: texts, sentences, word, morphems).
		The same pieces of software ('SIL FLEX', 'SIL Toolbox')
		typically produce dictionaries of the morphemes used in the
		glosses. 'InterlineaR' provide a function for turning the LIFT
		XML dictionary format into a set of data frames following a
		relational model in order to represent the dictionary entries,
		the sense(s) attached to the entries, the example(s) attached
		to senses, etc.
