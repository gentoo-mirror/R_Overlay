		Modelling and Analysis of Dynamic Computer Experiments //
		Emulating and solving inverse problems for dynamic computer
		experiments. It contains two major functionalities: (1)
		localized GP model for large-scale dynamic computer experiments
		using the algorithm proposed by Zhang et al. (2018)
		arXiv:1611.09488; (2) solving inverse problems in dynamic
		computer experiments. The current version only supports 64-bit
		version of R.
