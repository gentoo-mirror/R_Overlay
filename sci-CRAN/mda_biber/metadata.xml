		Functions for Multi-Dimensional Analysis // Multi-Dimensional
		Analysis (MDA) is an adaptation of factor analysis developed by
		Douglas Biber (1992) doi:10.1007/BF00136979. Its most common
		use is to describe language as it varies by genre, register,
		and use. This package contains functions for carrying out the
		calculations needed to describe and plot MDA results: dimension
		scores, dimension means, and factor loadings.
