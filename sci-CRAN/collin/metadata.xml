		Visualization the Effects of Collinearity in Distributed Lag
		Models and Other Linear Models // Tool to assessing whether the
		results of a study could be influenced by collinearity.
		Simulations under a given hypothesized truth regarding effects
		of an exposure on the outcome are used and the resulting curves
		of lagged effects are visualized. A user's manual is provided,
		which includes detailed examples (e.g. a cohort study looking
		for windows of vulnerability to air pollution, a time series
		study examining the linear association of air pollution with
		hospital admissions, and a time series study examining the non-
		linear association between temperature and mortality). The
		methods are described in Basagana and Barrera-Gomez (2021)
