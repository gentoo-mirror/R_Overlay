		Estimating the Parameters of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain from
		Discrete-Time Data // Estimation of Markov generator matrices
		from discrete-time observations. The implemented approaches
		comprise diagonal and weighted adjustment of matrix logarithm
		based candidate solutions as in Israel (2001)
		doi:10.1111/1467-9965.00114 as well as a quasi-optimization
		approach. Moreover, the expectation-maximization algorithm and
		the Gibbs sampling approach of Bladt and Sorensen (2005)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00508.x are included.
