		Parametric Time-Dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic //
		Producing the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic
		(ROC) curve through parametric approaches. Tools for generating
		random data, fitting, predicting and check goodness of fit are
		prepared. The methods are developed from the theoretical
		framework of proportional hazard model and copula functions.
		Using this package, users can now simulate parametric time-
		dependent ROC and run experiment to understand the behavior of
		the curve under different scenario.
