		Evaluation of Sprinkler Irrigation Uniformity and Efficiency //
		Processing and analysis of field collected or simulated
		sprinkler system catch data (depths) to characterize irrigation
		uniformity and efficiency using standard and other measures.
		Standard measures include the Christiansen coefficient of
		uniformity (CU) as found in Christiansen, J.E.(1942,
		ISBN:0138779295, "Irrigation by Sprinkling"); and distribution
		uniformity (DU), potential efficiency of the low quarter
		(PELQ), and application efficiency of the low quarter (AELQ)
		that are implementations of measures of the same notation in
		Keller, J. and Merriam, J.L. (1978) "Farm Irrigation System
		Evaluation: A Guide for Management"
		https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG745.pdf. spreval::DU.lh is
		similar to spreval::DU but is the distribution uniformity of
		the low half instead of low quarter as in DU. spreval::PELQT is
		a version of spreval::PELQ adapted for traveling systems
		instead of lateral move or solid-set sprinkler systems. The
		function spreval::eff is analogous to the method used to
		compute application efficiency for furrow irrigation presented
		in Walker, W. and Skogerboe, G.V. (1987,ISBN:0138779295,
		"Surface Irrigation: Theory and Practice"),that uses piecewise
		integration of infiltrated depth compared against soil-moisture
		deficit (SMD), when the argument "target" is set equal to SMD.
		The other functions contained in the package provide graphical
		representation of sprinkler system uniformity, and other
		standard univariate parametric and non-parametric statistical
		measures as applied to sprinkler system catch depths. A sample
		data set of field test data spreval::catchcan (catch depths) is
		provided and is used in examples and vignettes.
