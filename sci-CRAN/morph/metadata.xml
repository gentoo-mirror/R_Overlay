		3D Segmentation of Voxels into Morphologic Classes //
		Automatically segments a 3D array of voxels into mutually
		exclusive morphological elements. This package extends existing
		work for segmenting 2D binary raster data. A paper documenting
		this approach has been accepted for publication in the journal
		Landscape Ecology. Detailed references will be updated here
		once those are known.
