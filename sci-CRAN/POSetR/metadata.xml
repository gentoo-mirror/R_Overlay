		Partially Ordered Sets in R // Provides a set of basic tools for
		generating, analyzing, summarizing and visualizing finite
		partially ordered sets. In particular, it implements flexible
		and very efficient algorithms for the extraction of linear
		extensions and for the computation of mutual ranking
		probabilities and other user-defined functionals, over them.
		The package is meant as a computationally efficient "engine",
		for the implementation of data analysis procedures, on systems
		of multidimensional ordinal indicators and partially ordered
		data, in the spirit of Fattore, M. (2016) "Partially ordered
		sets and the measurement of multidimensional ordinal
		deprivation", Social Indicators Research
		DOI:10.1007/s11205-015-1059-6, and Fattore M. and Arcagni, A.
		(2018) "A reduced posetic approach to the measurement of
		multidimensional ordinal deprivation", Social Indicators
		Research DOI:10.1007/s11205-016-1501-4.
