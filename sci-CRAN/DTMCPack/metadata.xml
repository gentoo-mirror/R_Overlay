		Suite of Functions Related to Discrete-Time Discrete-State Markov
		Chains // A series of functions which aid in both simulating
		and determining the properties of finite, discrete-time,
		discrete state markov chains.  Two functions (DTMC, MultDTMC)
		produce n iterations of a Markov Chain(s)  based on transition
		probabilities and an initial distribution.  The function FPTime
		determines the first passage time into each state.  The
		function statdistr determines the stationary distribution of a
		Markov Chain.
