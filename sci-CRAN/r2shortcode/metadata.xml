		Shorten Function Names of Functions in Another Package and Create
		an Index to Make Them Accessible // When creating a package,
		authors may sometimes struggle with coming up with easy and
		straightforward function names, and at the same time hoping
		that other packages do not already have the same function
		names. In trying to meet this goal, sometimes, function names
		are not descriptive enough and may confuse the potential users.
		The purpose of this package is to serve as a package function
		short form generator and also provide shorthand names for other
		functions. Having this package will entice authors to create
		long function names without the fear of users not wanting to
		use their packages because of the long names. In a way,
		everyone wins - the authors can use long descriptive function
		names, and the users can use this package to make short
		functions names while still using the package in question.
