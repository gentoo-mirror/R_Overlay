		Pre-Compiled 'CmdStan' Models in R Packages // Similar to
		'rstantools' for 'rstan', the 'instantiate' package builds pre-
		compiled 'CmdStan' models into CRAN-ready statistical modeling
		R packages. The models compile once during installation, the
		executables live inside the file systems of their respective
		packages, and users have the full power and convenience of
		'cmdstanr' without any additional compilation after package
		installation. This approach saves time and helps R package
		developers migrate from 'rstan' to the more modern 'cmdstanr'.
		Packages 'rstantools', 'cmdstanr', 'stannis', and 'stanapi' are
		similar Stan clients with different objectives.
