		Multivariate Interpolation // Contains methods for creating
		multivariate interpolations of functions on a hypercube. If
		available through fftw3, the DCT-II/FFT is used to compute
		coefficients for a Chebyshev interpolation. Other interpolation
		methods for arbitrary Cartesian grids are also provided, a
		piecewise multilinear, and the Floater-Hormann barycenter
		method. For scattered data polyharmonic splines with a linear
		term is provided. The time-critical parts are written in C for
		speed. All interpolants are parallelized if used to evaluate
		more than one point.
