		Multivariate Chebyshev Interpolation // Contains methods for
		creating multivariate Chebyshev interpolations of functions on
		a hypercube. If available through fftw3, the DCT-II/FFT is used
		to compute the coefficients, so it is reasonably fast. Some
		interpolation methods for multivariate non-Chebyshev grids are
		also provided, as well as polyharmonic splines with a linear
		term.
