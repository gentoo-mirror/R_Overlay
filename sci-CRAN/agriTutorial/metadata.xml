		Tutorial Analysis of Some Agricultural Experiments // Example
		software for the analysis of data from designed experiments,
		especially agricultural crop experiments. The basics of the
		analysis of designed experiments are discussed using real
		examples from agricultural field trials. A range of statistical
		methods using a range of R statistical packages are
		exemplified . The experimental data is made available as
		separate data sets for each example and the R analysis code is
		made available as example code. The example code can be readily
		extended, as required.
