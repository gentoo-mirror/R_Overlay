		Estimate Parameters of the Best-Fitting JohnsonSU Distribution //
		Uses least squares optimisation to estimate the parameters of
		the best-fitting JohnsonSU distribution for a given dataset,
		with the possibility of the distributions corresponding to the
		limiting cases of the JohnsonSU distribution. The code for the
		Golden Section Search used in the optimisation has been adapted
		from E. Cai. This package has been created as an extension of
		my Master's thesis. E. Cai (2013, "Scripts and Functions: Using
		R to Implement the Golden Section Search Method for Numerical
		Optimization",
		https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/using-r-
		to-implement-the-golden-bisection-method/).
