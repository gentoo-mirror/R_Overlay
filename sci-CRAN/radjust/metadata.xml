		Replicability Adjusted p-Values for Two Independent Studies with
		Multiple Endpoints // Calculates adjusted p-values for the null
		hypothesis of no replicability across studies for two study
		designs: (i) a primary and follow-up study, where the features
		in the follow-up study are selected from the primary study, as
		described in Bogomolov and Heller (2013)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.829002 and Heller, Bogomolov and
		Benjamini (2014) doi:10.1073/pnas.1314814111; (ii) two
		independent studies, where the features for replicability are
		first selected in each study separately, as described in
		Bogomolov and Heller (2018) doi:10.1093/biomet/asy029. The
		latter design is the one encountered in a typical meta-analysis
		of two studies, but the inference is for replicability rather
		than for identifying the features that are non-null in at least
		one study.
