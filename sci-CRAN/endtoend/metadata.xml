		Transmissions and Receptions in an End to End Network // Computes
		the expectation of the number of transmissions and receptions
		considering an End-to-End transport model with limited number
		of retransmissions per packet. It provides theoretical results
		and also estimated values based on Monte Carlo simulations. It
		is also possible to consider random data and ACK probabilities.
