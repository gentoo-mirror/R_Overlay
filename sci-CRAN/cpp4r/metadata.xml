		Header-Only 'C++' and 'R' Interface // Provides a header only,
		'C++' interface to 'R' with enhancements over 'cpp11'. Enforces
		copy-on-write semantics consistent with 'R' behavior. Offers
		native support for ALTREP objects, 'UTF-8' string handling,
		modern 'C++11' features and idioms, and reduced memory
		requirements. Allows for vendoring, making it useful for
		restricted environments. Compared to 'cpp11', it adds support
		for converting 'C++' maps to 'R' lists, 'Roxygen' documentation
		directly in 'C++' code, proper handling of matrix attributes,
		support for nullable external pointers, bidirectional copy of
		complex number types, flexibility in type conversions, use of
		nullable pointers, and various performance optimizations.
