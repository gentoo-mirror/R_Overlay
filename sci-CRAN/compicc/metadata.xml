		Calculate the Confidence Interval for the Difference of ICCs //
		Contains functions to calculate the confidence interval for the
		difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients
		(ICCs) of two datasets. The package contains two functions: one
		for two dependent datasets and one for two independent
		datasets. The method for calculating the confidence intervals
		is found in Ramasundarahettige et al. (2009) DOI:
		10.1002/sim.3523.
