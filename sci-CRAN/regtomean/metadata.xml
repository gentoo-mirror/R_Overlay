		Regression Toward the Mean // In repeated measures studies with
		extreme large or small values it is common that the subjects
		measurements on average are closer to the mean of the basic
		population. Interpreting possible changes in the mean in such
		situations can lead to biased results since the values were not
		randomly selected, they come from truncated sampling. This
		method allows to estimate the range of means where treatment
		effects are likely to occur when regression toward the mean is
		present. Ostermann, T., Willich, Stefan N.  Luedtke, Rainer.
