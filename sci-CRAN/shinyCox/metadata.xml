		Create 'shiny' Applications for Cox Proportional Hazards Models
		// Takes one or more fitted Cox proportional hazards models and
		writes a 'shiny' application to a directory specified by the
		user. The 'shiny' application displays predicted survival
		curves based on user input, and contains none of the original
		data used to create the Cox model or models. The goal is
		towards visualization and presentation of predicted survival
		curves.
