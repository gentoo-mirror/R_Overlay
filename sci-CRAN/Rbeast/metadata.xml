		Bayesian Change-Point Detection and Time Series Decomposition //
		Interpretation of time series data is affected by model
		choices. Different models can give different or even
		contradicting estimates of patterns, trends, and mechanisms for
		the same data--a limitation alleviated by the Bayesian
		estimator of abrupt change,seasonality, and trend (BEAST) of
		this package. BEAST seeks to improve time series decomposition
		by forgoing the "single-best-model" concept and embracing all
		competing models into the inference via a Bayesian model
		averaging scheme. It is a flexible tool to uncover abrupt
		changes (i.e., change-points, breakpoints, structural breaks,
		or join-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and
		nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just
		tells when changes occur but also quantifies how likely the
		detected changes are true. It detects not just piecewise linear
		trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable
		to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote
		sensing, economics, climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology.
		Example applications include its use to identify regime shifts
		in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation
		from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data,
		pinpoint anomaly and extreme events in climate data, and
		unravel system dynamics in biological data. Details on BEAST
		are reported in Zhao et al. (2019)
