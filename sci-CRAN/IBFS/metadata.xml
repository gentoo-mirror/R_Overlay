		Initial Basic Feasible Solution for Transportation Problem // The
		initial basic feasible solution (IBFS) is a significant step to
		achieve the minimal total cost (optimal solution) of the
		transportation problem. However, the existing methods of IBFS
		do not always provide a good feasible solution which can reduce
		the number of iterations to find the optimal solution. This
		initial basic feasible solution can be obtained by using any of
		the following methods. a) North West Corner Method. b) Least
		Cost Method. c) Row Minimum Method. d) Column Minimum Method.
		e) Vogel's Approximation Method. etc. For more technical
		details about the algorithms please refer below URLs. https://t
