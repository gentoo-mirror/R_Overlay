		Distributional Data Analysis Techniques for Biosensor Data //
		Unified and user-friendly framework for using new
		distributional representations of biosensors data in different
		statistical modeling tasks: regression models, hypothesis
		testing, cluster analysis, visualization, and descriptive
		analysis. Distributional representations are a functional
		extension of compositional time-range metrics and we have used
		them successfully so far in modeling glucose profiles and
		accelerometer data. However, these functional representations
		can be used to represent any biosensor data such as ECG or
		medical imaging such as fMRI. Matabuena M, Petersen A, Vidal
		JC, Gude F. "Glucodensities: A new representation of glucose
