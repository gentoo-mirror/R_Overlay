		Compute and Visualize Profile Extrema Functions // Computes
		profile extrema functions for arbitrary functions. If the
		function is expensive-to-evaluate it computes profile extrema
		by emulating the function with a Gaussian process (using
		package 'DiceKriging'). In this case uncertainty quantification
		on the profile extrema can also be computed. The different
		plotting functions for profile extrema give the user a tool to
		better locate excursion sets.
