		'WhiteboxTools' R Frontend // An R frontend of the
		'WhiteboxTools' library, which is an advanced geospatial data
		analysis platform developed by Prof. John Lindsay at the
		University of Guelph's Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics
		Research Group. 'WhiteboxTools' can be used to perform common
		geographical information systems (GIS) analysis operations,
		such as cost-distance analysis, distance buffering, and raster
		reclassification. Remote sensing and image processing tasks
		include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening,
		contrast adjustments), image mosaicing, numerous filtering
		operations, simple classification (k-means), and common image
		transformations. 'WhiteboxTools' also contains advanced tooling
		for spatial hydrological analysis (e.g. flow-accumulation,
		watershed delineation, stream network analysis, sink removal),
		terrain analysis (e.g. common terrain indices such as slope,
		curvatures, wetness index, hillshading; hypsometric analysis;
		multi-scale topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data
		processing. Suggested citation: Lindsay (2016)
