		Network Analysis and Visualization // Collection of functions for
		fast manipulation, handling, and analysis of large-scale
		networks based on family and social data. Functions are utility
		functions used to manipulate data in three "formats": sparse
		adjacency matrices, pedigree trio family data, and pedigree
		family data. When possible, the functions should be able to
		handle millions of data points quickly for use in combination
		with data from large public national registers and databases.
