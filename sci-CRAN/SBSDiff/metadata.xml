		Satorra-Bentler Scaled Chi-Squared Difference Test // Calculates
		a Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-squared difference test between
		nested models that were estimated using maximum likelihood (ML)
		with robust standard errors, which cannot be calculated the
		traditional way. For details see Satorra  Bentler (2001)
		doi:10.1007/bf02296192 and Satorra  Bentler (2010)
		doi:10.1007/s11336-009-9135-y. This package may be particularly
		helpful when used in conjunction with 'Mplus' software,
		specifically when implementing the complex survey option. In
		such cases, the model estimator in 'Mplus' defaults to ML with
		robust standard errors.
