		Identification of Cancer Dysfunctional Subpathway by Integrating
		DNA Methylation, Copy Number Variation, and Gene Expression
		Data // Identify Cancer Dysfunctional Sub-pathway by
		integrating gene expression, DNA methylation and copy number
		variation, and pathway topological information. 1)We firstly
		calculate the gene risk scores by integrating three kinds of
		data: DNA methylation, copy number variation, and gene
		expression.  2)Secondly, we perform a greedy search algorithm
		to identify the key dysfunctional sub-pathways within the
		pathways for which the discriminative scores were locally
		maximal. 3)Finally, the permutation test was used to calculate
		statistical significance level for these key dysfunctional sub-
		pathways.
