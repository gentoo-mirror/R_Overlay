		Chaotic Time Series Analysis // Chaos theory has been hailed as a
		revolution of thoughts and attracting ever increasing attention
		of many scientists from diverse disciplines. Chaotic systems
		are nonlinear deterministic dynamic systems which can behave
		like an erratic and apparently random motion. A relevant field
		inside chaos theory and nonlinear time series analysis is the
		detection of a chaotic behaviour from empirical time series
		data. One of the main features of chaos is the well known
		initial value sensitivity property. Methods and techniques
		related to test the hypothesis of chaos try to quantify the
		initial value sensitive property estimating the Lyapunov
		exponents. The DChaos package provides different useful tools
		and efficient algorithms which test robustly the hypothesis of
		chaos based on the Lyapunov exponent in order to know if the
		data generating process behind time series behave chaotically
		or not.
