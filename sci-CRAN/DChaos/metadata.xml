		Chaotic Time Series Analysis // Provides several algorithms for
		the purpose of detecting chaotic signals inside univariate time
		series. We focus on methods derived from chaos theory which
		estimate the complexity of a dataset through exploring the
		structure of the attractor. We have taken into account the
		Lyapunov exponents as an ergodic measure. We have implemented
		the Jacobian method by a fit through neural networks in order
		to estimate both the largest and the spectrum of Lyapunov
		exponents. We have considered the full sample and three
		different methods of subsampling by blocks (non-overlapping,
		equally spaced and bootstrap) to estimate them. In addition, it
		is possible to make inference about them and know if the
		estimated Lyapunov exponents values are or not statistically
		significant. This library can be used with time series whose
		time-lapse is fixed or variable. That is, it considers time
		series whose observations are sampled at fixed or variable time
		intervals. For a review see David Ruelle and Floris Takens
