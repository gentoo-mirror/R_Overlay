		C/C++ Source Code to Trigger Address and Undefined Behaviour
		Sanitizers // Recent gcc and clang compiler versions provide
		functionality to test for memory violations and other undefined
		behaviour; this is often referred to as "Address Sanitizer" (or
		'ASAN') and "Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer" ('UBSAN'). The
		Writing R Extension manual describes this in some detail in
		Section 4.3 title "Checking Memory Access". . This feature has
		to be enabled in the corresponding binary, eg in R, which is
		somewhat involved as it also required a current compiler
		toolchain which is not yet widely available, or in the case of
		Windows, not available at all (via the common Rtools
		mechanism). . As an alternative, pre-built Docker containers
		such as the Rocker container 'r-devel-san' or the multi-purpose
		container 'r-debug' can be used. . This package then provides a
		means of testing the compiler setup as the known code failures
		provides in the sample code here should be detected correctly,
		whereas a default build of R will let the package pass. . The
		code samples are based on the examples from the Address
		Sanitizer Wiki at https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki.
