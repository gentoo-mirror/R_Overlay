		Transparent Assessment Framework for Reproducible Research //
		General framework to organize data, methods, and results used
		in reproducible scientific analyses. A TAF analysis consists of
		four scripts (data.R, model.R, output.R, report.R) that are run
		sequentially. Each script starts by reading files from a
		previous step and ends with writing out files for the next
		step. Convenience functions are provided to version control the
		required data and software, run analyses, clean residues from
		previous runs, manage files, manipulate tables, and produce
		figures. With a focus on stability and reproducible analyses,
		the TAF package comes with no dependencies. TAF forms a base
		layer for the 'icesTAF' package and other scientific
		applications.
