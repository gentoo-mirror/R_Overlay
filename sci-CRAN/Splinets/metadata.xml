		Functional Data Analysis using Splines and Orthogonal Spline
		Bases // Splines are efficiently represented through their
		Taylor expansion at the knots. The representation accounts for
		the support sets and is thus suitable for sparse functional
		data. The B-splines and orthogonal bases of splines that reside
		on small total support are implemented. The orthogonal bases
		and are utilized for functional data analysis. Random spline
		generator is implemented as well as all fundamental algebraic
		and calculus operations on splines. The optimal, in the least
		square sense, functional fit to data consisting of sampled
		values of functions as well as splines build over another set
		of knots is obtained. Podgrski, K. (2021)  arXiv:2102.00733.
