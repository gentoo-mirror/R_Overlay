		Functional Data Analysis using Splines and Orthogonal Spline
		Bases // Splines are efficiently represented through their
		Taylor expansion at the knots. The representation accounts for
		the support sets and is thus suitable for sparse functional
		data. Two cases of boundary conditions are considered: zero-
		boundary or periodic-boundary for all derivatives except the
		last. The periodical splines are represented graphically using
		polar coordinates. The B-splines and orthogonal bases of
		splines that reside on small total support are implemented. The
		orthogonal bases are referred to as 'splinets' and are utilized
		for functional data analysis. Random spline generator is
		implemented as well as  all fundamental algebraic and calculus
		operations on splines.  The optimal, in the least square sense,
		functional fit by 'splinets' to data consisting of sampled
		values of functions as well as splines build over another set
		of knots is obtained and used for functional data analysis.
