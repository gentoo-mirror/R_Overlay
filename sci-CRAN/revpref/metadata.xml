		Tools for Computational Revealed Preference Analysis // Tools to
		(i) check consistency of a finite set of consumer demand
		observations with a number of revealed preference axioms at a
		given efficiency level, (ii) compute goodness-of-fit indices
		when the data do not obey the axioms, and (iii) compute power
		against uniformly random behavior.
