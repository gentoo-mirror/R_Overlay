		Visualization of Structures in High-Dimensional Data // By
		gaining the property of emergence through self-organization,
		the enhancement of SOMs(self organizing maps) is called
		Emergent SOM (ESOM). The result of the projection by ESOM is a
		grid of neurons which can be visualised as a three dimensional
		landscape in form of the Umatrix. Further details can be found
		in the referenced publications (see url). This package offers
		tools for calculating and visualising the ESOM as well as
		Umatrix, Pmatrix and UStarMatrix. All the functionality is also
		available through graphical user interfaces implemented in
		'shiny'.
