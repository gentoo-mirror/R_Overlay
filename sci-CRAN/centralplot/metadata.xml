		Show the Strength of Relationships Between Centre and Peripheral
		Items // The degree of correlation between centre and
		peripheral items are shown by the length of the line between
		them. You can self-define the length by inputing the "distance"
		parameter. For example, you can input (1 - Pearson's
		correlation coefficient) as "distance" so that the stronger the
		correlation between centre and peripheral item, the nearer they
		will be in this plot. Also, If you do a hypothesis test and the
		null hypothesis is centre and peripheral items are the same,
		you can input -log(P) as distance. To sum up, the stronger the
		correlation between centre and peripheral is, the smaller the
		"distance" parameter should be. Due to its high degree of
		freedom, it can be applied to many different circumstance.
