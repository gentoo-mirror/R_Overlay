		'Open Tracing' // 'Open Tracing' https://opentracing.io allows
		developers to add instrumentation to their application code
		using interfaces that are vendor-agnostic. This is used to
		monitor services, triage failures and find performance
		bottlenecks, among other things. The 'ot' package has generic
		methods to be extended when implementing the specification for
