		Fits Regression  ARMA Models Subject to Constraints to the
		Coefficient // Fits or generalized linear models either a
		regression with Autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) errors for
		time series data. The package makes it easy to incorporate
		constraints into the model's coefficients. The model is
		specified by an objective function (Gaussian, Binomial or
		Poisson) or an ARMA order (p,q), a vector of bound constraints
		for the coefficients (i.e beta1  0) and the possibility to
		incorporate restrictions among coefficients (i.e beta1  beta2).
		The references of this packages are the same as 'stats' package
		for glm() and arima() functions. See Brockwell, P. J. and
		Davis, R. A. (1996, ISBN-10: 9783319298528). For the different
		optimizers implemented, it is recommended to consult the
		documentation of the corresponding packages.
