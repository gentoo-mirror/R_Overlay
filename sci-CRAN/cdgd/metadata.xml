		Causal Decomposition of Group Disparities // The causal
		decompositions of group disparities developed by Yu and Elwert
		(2023) https://ang-yu.github.io/files/Causal_Decomposition_of_G
		roup_Disparities_2023.pdf. This package implements the
		estimators for the decomposition components that are based on
		efficient influence functions. For the nuisance functions of
		the estimators, both parametric and nonparametric options are
		provided, as well as manual options in case the default models
		are not satisfying.
