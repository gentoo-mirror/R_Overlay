		Causal Decomposition of Group Disparities // The framework of
		causal decomposition of group disparities developed by Yu and
		Elwert (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2306.16591. This package
		implements the decomposition estimators that are based on
		efficient influence functions. For the nuisance functions of
		the estimators, both parametric and nonparametric options are
		provided, as well as manual options in case the default models
		are not satisfying.
