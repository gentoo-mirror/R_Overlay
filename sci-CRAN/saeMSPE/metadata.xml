		Compute MSPE Estimates for the Fay Herriot Model and Nested Error
		Regression Model // We describe a new R package entitled
		'saeMSPE' for the well-known Fay Herriot model and nested error
		regression model in small area estimation. Based on this
		package, it is possible to easily compute various common mean
		squared predictive error (MSPE) estimators, as well as several
		existing variance component predictors as a byproduct, for
		these two models.
