		The Second Dimension of Spatial Association // Most of the
		current methods explore spatial association using observations
		at sample locations, which are defined as the first dimension
		of spatial association (FDA). The proposed concept of the
		second dimension of spatial association (SDA), as described in
		Yongze Song (2022) doi:10.1016/j.jag.2022.102834, aims to
		extract in-depth information about the geographical environment
		from locations outside sample locations for exploring spatial
		association.
