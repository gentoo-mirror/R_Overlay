		The Second Dimension of Spatial Associations // Most of the
		current methods explore spatial associations using observations
		at sample locations, which are defined as the first dimension
		of spatial associations (FDA). The proposed concept of the
		second dimension of spatial associations (SDA) aims to extract
		in-depth information about the geographical environment from
		locations outside sample locations for exploring spatial
		associations.
