		Distributional Stochastic Frontier Analysis // Framework to fit
		distributional stochastic frontier models. Casts the stochastic
		frontier model into the flexible framework of distributional
		regression or otherwise known as General Additive Models of
		Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). Allows for linear, non-
		linear, random and spatial effects on all the parameters of the
		distribution of the output, e.g. effects on the production or
		cost function, heterogeneity of the noise and inefficiency.
		Available distributions are the normal-halfnormal and normal-
		exponential distribution. Estimation via the fast and reliable
		routines of the 'mgcv' package. For more details see
