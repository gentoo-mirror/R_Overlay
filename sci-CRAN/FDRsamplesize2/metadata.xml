		Computing Power and Sample Size for the False Discovery Rate in
		Multiple Applications // Defines a collection of functions to
		compute average power and sample size for studies that use the
		false discovery rate as the final measure of statistical
		significance. A three-rectangle approximation method of a
		p-value histogram is proposed to derive a formula to compute
		the statistical power for analyses that involve the FDR. The
		methodology paper of this package is under review.
