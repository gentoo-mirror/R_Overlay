		Feature Extraction from Grouped Data // An R6 implementation for
		calculating features from grouped data. The output will be one
		row for each group. This functionality is often needed in the
		feature extraction process of machine learning problems. Very
		large datasets are supported, since data is only read into RAM
		when needed. Calculation can be done in parallel and the
		process can be monitored. Global error handling is supported.
		Results are available in one final dataframe.
