		Multiomics Data Integration // Provides functions to do 'O2PLS-
		DA' analysis for multiple omics data integration. The algorithm
		came from "O2-PLS, a two-block (XY) latent variable regression
		(LVR) method with an integral OSC filter" which published by
		Johan Trygg and Svante Wold at 2003 doi:10.1002/cem.775.
		'O2PLS' is a bidirectional multivariate regression method that
		aims to separate the covariance between two data sets (it was
		recently extended to multiple data sets) (Lfstedt and Trygg,
		2011 doi:10.1002/cem.1388; Lfstedt et al., 2012
		doi:10.1016/j.aca.2013.06.026) from the systematic sources of
		variance being specific for each data set separately.
