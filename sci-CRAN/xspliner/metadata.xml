		Assisted Model Building, using Surrogate Black-Box Models to
		Train Interpretable Spline Based Additive Models // Builds
		generalized linear model with automatic data transformation.
		The 'xspliner' helps to build simple, interpretable models that
		inherits informations provided by more complicated ones. The
		resulting model may be treated as explanation of provided black
		box, that was supplied prior to the algorithm.
