		Simulation Methods for Legislative Redistricting // Enables
		researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified
		target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo algorithms.  The package allows for the
		implementation of various constraints in the redistricting
		process such as geographic compactness and population parity
		requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of various
		summary statistics and plotting functionality are also
		included. The package implements methods described in Fifield,
		Higgins, Imai and Tarr (2020)
