		Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods for Redistricting Simulation //
		Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-
		specified target distribution using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
		algorithm. The package allows for the implementation of various
		constraints in the redistricting process such as geographic
		compactness and population parity requirements.  The algorithm
		also can be used in combination with efficient simulation
		methods such as simulated and parallel tempering algorithms.
		Tools for analysis such as inverse probability reweighting and
		plotting functionality are included. The package implements
		methods described in Fifield, Higgins, Imai and Tarr (2016) ``A
		New Automated Redistricting Simulator Using Markov Chain Monte
		Carlo,'' working paper available at
		http://http://imai.princeton.edu/research/files/redist.pdf.
