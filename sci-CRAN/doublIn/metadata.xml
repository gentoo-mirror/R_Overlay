		Estimate Incubation or Latency Time using Doubly Interval
		Censored Observations // Visualize contact tracing data using a
		'shiny' app and estimate the incubation or latency time of an
		infectious disease respecting the following characteristics in
		the analysis; (i) doubly interval censoring with (partly)
		overlapping or distinct windows; (ii) an infection risk
		corresponding to exponential growth; (iii) right truncation
		allowing for individual truncation times; (iv) different
		choices concerning the family of the distribution. For our
		earlier work, we refer to Arntzen et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1002/sim.9726. A paper describing our approach in detail
		will follow.
