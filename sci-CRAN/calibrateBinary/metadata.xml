		Calibration for Computer Experiments with Binary Responses //
		Performs the calibration procedure proposed by Sung et al.
		(2018+) arXiv:1806.01453. This calibration method is
		particularly useful when the outputs of both computer and
		physical experiments are binary and the estimation for the
		calibration parameters is of interest.
