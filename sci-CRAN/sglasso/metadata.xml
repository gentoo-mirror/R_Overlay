		Lasso Method for RCON(V,E) Models // RCON(V, E) models are a kind
		of restriction of the Gaussian Graphical Models defined by a
		set of equality constraints on the entries of the concentration
		matrix. 'sglasso' package implements the structured graphical
		lasso (sglasso) estimator proposed in Abbruzzo et al. (2014)
		for the weighted l1-penalized RCON(V, E) model. Two cyclic
		coordinate algorithms are implemented to compute the sglasso
		estimator, i.e. a cyclic coordinate minimization (CCM) and a
		cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm.
