		Design of Portfolio of Stocks to Track an Index // Computation of
		sparse portfolios for financial index tracking, i.e., joint
		selection of a subset of the assets that compose the index and
		computation of their relative weights (capital allocation). The
		level of sparsity of the portfolios, i.e., the number of
		selected assets, is controlled through a regularization
		parameter. Different tracking measures are available, namely,
		the empirical tracking error (ETE), downside risk (DR), Huber
		empirical tracking error (HETE), and Huber downside risk (HDR).
		See vignette for a detailed documentation and comparison, with
		several illustrative examples. The package is based on the
		paper: K. Benidis, Y. Feng, and D. P. Palomar, "Sparse
		Portfolios for High-Dimensional Financial Index Tracking," IEEE
		Trans. on Signal Processing, vol. 66, no. 1, pp. 155-170, Jan.
		2018. doi:10.1109/TSP.2017.2762286.
