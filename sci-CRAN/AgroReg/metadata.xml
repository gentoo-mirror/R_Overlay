		Regression Analysis Linear and Nonlinear for Agriculture //
		Linear and nonlinear regression analysis common in agricultural
		science papers (Archontoulis  Miguez (2015).
		doi:10.2134/agronj2012.0506). The package includes linear,
		quadratic, cubic, inverse quadratic, exponential, negative
		exponential, biexponential, Gaussian, three- or four-parameter
		logistic, four- or five-parameter Brain-Cousens logistic, four-
		or five-parameter Cedergreen-Ritz-Streibig logistic models.
		five parameters, Gompertz logistic, Michaelis-Menten,
		logarithmic, linear-linear segmented, linear-plate segmented,
		quadratic-plate segmented, nonparametric loess. The functions
		return the model coefficients and their respective p values,
		coefficient of determination, root mean square error, AIC, BIC,
		as well as graphs with the equations automatically.
