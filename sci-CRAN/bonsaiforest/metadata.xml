		Shrinkage Based Forest Plots // Subgroup analyses are routinely
		performed in clinical trial analyses. From a methodological
		perspective, two key issues of subgroup analyses are
		multiplicity (even if only predefined subgroups are
		investigated) and the low sample sizes of subgroups which lead
		to highly variable estimates, see e.g. Yusuf et al (1991)
		doi:10.1001/jama.1991.03470010097038. This package implements
		subgroup estimates based on Bayesian shrinkage priors, see
		Carvalho et al (2019)
		https://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/carvalho09a.html. In addition,
		estimates based on penalized likelihood inference are
		available, based on Simon et al (2011)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v039.i05. The corresponding shrinkage based
		forest plots address the aforementioned issues and can
		complement standard forest plots in practical clinical trial
		analyses.
