		Tools for Analyzing Climate Extremes // Functions for fitting GEV
		and POT (via point process fitting) models for extremes in
		climate data, providing return values, return probabilities,
		and return periods for stationary and nonstationary models.
		Also provides differences in return values and differences in
		log return probabilities for contrasts of covariate values.
		Functions for estimating risk ratios for event attribution
		analyses, including uncertainty. Under the hood, many of the
		functions use functions from 'extRemes', including for fitting
		the statistical models.
