		Raster Thresholding Using Otsus Algorithm // Provides tools to
		process raster data and apply Otsu-based thresholding for
		burned area mapping and other image segmentation tasks.
		Implements the method described by Otsu (1979)
		doi:10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076, a data-driven technique that
		determines an optimal threshold by maximizing the inter-class
		variance of pixel intensities. It includes validation functions
		to assess segmentation accuracy against reference data using
		standard accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and
		F1-score.
