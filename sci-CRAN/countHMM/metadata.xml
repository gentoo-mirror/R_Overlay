		Penalized Estimation of Flexible Hidden Markov Models for Time
		Series of Counts // Provides tools for penalized estimation of
		flexible hidden Markov models for time series of counts w/o the
		need to specify a (parametric) family of distributions. These
		include functions for model fitting, model checking, and state
		decoding. For details, see Adam, T., Langrock, R., and Wei,
		C.H. (2019): Penalized Estimation of Flexible Hidden Markov
		Models for Time Series of Counts. arXiv:1901.03275.
