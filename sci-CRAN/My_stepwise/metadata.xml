		Stepwise Variable Selection Procedures for Regression Analysis //
		The stepwise variable selection procedure (with iterations
		between the 'forward' and 'backward' steps) can be used to
		obtain the best candidate final regression model in regression
		analysis. All the relevant covariates are put on the 'variable
		list' to be selected. The significance levels for entry (SLE)
		and for stay (SLS) are usually set to 0.15 (or larger) for
		being conservative. Then, with the aid of substantive
		knowledge, the best candidate final regression model is
		identified manually by dropping the covariates with p value
		0.05 one at a time until all regression coefficients are
		significantly different from 0 at the chosen alpha level of
		0.05.
