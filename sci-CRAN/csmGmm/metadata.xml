		Conditionally Symmetric Multidimensional Gaussian Mixture Model
		// Implements the conditionally symmetric multidimensional
		Gaussian mixture model (csmGmm) for large-scale testing of
		composite null hypotheses in genetic association applications
		such as mediation analysis, pleiotropy analysis, and
		replication analysis. In such analyses, we typically have J
		sets of K test statistics where K is a small number (e.g. 2 or
		3) and J is large (e.g. 1 million). For each one of the J sets,
		we want to know if we can reject all K individual nulls. Please
		see the vignette for a quickstart guide. The paper describing
		these methods is "Testing a Large Number of Composite Null
		Hypotheses Using Conditionally Symmetric Multidimensional
		Gaussian Mixtures in Genome-Wide Studies" by Sun R, McCaw Z,
		Lin X (Journal of the American Statistical Association 2025,
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2024.2422124).
