		Estimating and Testing Direct Effects in Directed Acyclic Graphs
		using Estimating Equations // In many studies across different
		disciplines, detailed measures of the variables of interest are
		available. If assumptions can be made regarding the direction
		of effects between the assessed variables, this has to be
		considered in the analysis. The functions in this package
		implement the novel approach CIEE (causal inference using
		estimating equations; Konigorski et al., 2018,
		DOI:10.1002/gepi.22107) for estimating and testing the direct
		effect of an exposure variable on a primary outcome, while
		adjusting for indirect effects of the exposure on the primary
		outcome through a secondary intermediate outcome and potential
		factors influencing the secondary outcome. The underlying
		directed acyclic graph (DAG) of this considered model is
		described in the vignette. CIEE can be applied to studies in
		many different fields, and it is implemented here for the
		analysis of a continuous primary outcome and a time-to-event
		primary outcome subject to censoring. CIEE uses estimating
		equations to obtain estimates of the direct effect and robust
		sandwich standard error estimates. Then, a large-sample Wald-
		type test statistic is computed for testing the absence of the
		direct effect. Additionally, standard multiple regression,
		regression of residuals, and the structural equation modeling
		approach are implemented for comparison.
