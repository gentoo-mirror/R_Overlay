		Parallel Dynamic Web-Scraping Using 'RSelenium' // A system to
		increase the efficiency of dynamic web-scraping with
		'RSelenium' by leveraging parallel processing. You provide a
		function wrapper for your 'RSelenium' scraping routine with a
		set of inputs, and 'parsel' runs it in several browser
		instances. Chunked input processing as well as error catching
		and logging ensures seamless execution and minimal data loss,
		even when unforeseen 'RSelenium' errors occur.
