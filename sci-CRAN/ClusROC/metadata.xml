		ROC Analysis in Three-Class Classification Problems for Clustered
		Data // Statistical methods for ROC surface analysis in three-
		class classification problems for clustered data and in
		presence of covariates. In particular, the package allows to
		obtain covariate-specific point and interval estimation for:
		(i) true class fractions (TCFs) at fixed pairs of thresholds;
		(ii) the ROC surface; (iii) the volume under ROC surface (VUS);
		(iv) the optimal pairs of thresholds. Methods considered in
		points (i), (ii) and (iv) are proposed and discussed in To et
		al. (2022) doi:10.1177/09622802221089029. Referring to point
		(iv), three  different selection criteria are implemented:
		Generalized Youden Index (GYI), Closest to Perfection (CtP) and
		Maximum Volume (MV). Methods considered in point (iii) are
		proposed and discussed in Xiong et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1177/0962280217742539. Visualization tools are also
		provided. We refer readers to the articles cited above for all
		details.
