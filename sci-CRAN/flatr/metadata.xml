		Transforms Contingency Tables to Data Frames, and Analyses Them
		// Contingency Tables are a pain to work with when you want to
		run regressions. This package takes them, flattens them into a
		long data frame, so you can more easily analyse them! As well,
		you can calculate other related statistics. All of this is done
		so in a 'tidy' manner, so it should tie in nicely with
		'tidyverse' series of packages.
