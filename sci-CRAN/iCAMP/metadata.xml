		Infer Community Assembly Mechanisms by Phylogenetic-Bin-Based
		Null Model Analysis // To implement a general framework to
		quantitatively infer Community Assembly Mechanisms by
		Phylogenetic-bin-based null model analysis, abbreviated as
		'iCAMP' (Ning et al 2020) doi:10.1038/s41467-020-18560-z. It
		can quantitatively assess the relative importance of different
		community assembly processes, such as selection, dispersal, and
		drift, for both communities and each phylogenetic group
		('bin'). Each bin usually consists of different taxa from a
		family or an order. The package also provides functions to
		implement some other published methods, including neutral taxa
		percentage (Burns et al 2016) doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.142 based
		on neutral theory model (Sloan et al 2006)
		doi:10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00956.x and quantifying assembly
		processes based on entire-community null models ('QPEN', Stegen
		et al 2013) doi:10.1038/ismej.2013.93. It also includes some
		handy functions, particularly for big datasets, such as
		phylogenetic and taxonomic null model analysis at both
		community and bin levels, between-taxa niche difference and
		phylogenetic distance calculation, phylogenetic signal test
		within phylogenetic groups, midpoint root of big trees, etc.
		Version 1.3.x mainly improved the function for 'QPEN' and added
		function 'icamp.cate()' to summarize 'iCAMP' results for
		different categories of taxa (e.g. core versus rare taxa).
