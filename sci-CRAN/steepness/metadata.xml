		Testing Steepness of Dominance Hierarchies // steepness is a
		package that computes steepness as a property of dominance
		hierarchies. Steepness is defined as the absolute slope of the
		straight line fitted to the normalized David's scores. The
		normalized David's scores can be obtained on the basis of
		dyadic dominance indices corrected for chance or by means of
		proportions of wins. Given an observed sociomatrix, it computes
		hierarchy's steepness and estimates statistical significance by
		means of a randomization test.
