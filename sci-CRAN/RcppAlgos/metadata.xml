		High Performance Tools for Combinatorics and Computational
		Mathematics // Provides optimized functions implemented in C++
		with 'Rcpp' for solving problems in combinatorics and
		computational mathematics. There are combination/permutation
		functions that are both flexible as well as efficient with
		respect to speed and memory. Constraint parameters allow for
		generation of all combinations/permutations of a vector meeting
		specific criteria (e.g. finding all combinations such that the
		sum is less than a bound). Capable of generating specific
		combinations/permutations (e.g. retrieve only the nth
		lexicographical result) which sets up nicely for
		parallelization as well as random sampling. Gmp support permits
		exploration where the total number of results is large (e.g.
		comboSample(10000, 500, n = 4)). Additionally, there are
		several highly efficient number theoretic functions that are
		useful for problems common in computational mathematics. Some
		of these functions make use of the fast integer division
		library 'libdivide' by http://ridiculousfish.com. The
		primeSieve function is based on the segmented sieve of
		Eratosthenes implementation by Kim Walisch. It is capable of
		generating all primes less than a billion in just over 1
		second. It can also quickly generate prime numbers over a range
		(e.g. primeSieve(10^13, 10^13+10^9)). Finally, there is a prime
		counting function that implements a simple variations of
		Legendre's formula based on the algorithm by Kim Walisch.
