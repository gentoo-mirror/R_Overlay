		Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics // Provides
		optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp' for solving
		problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics. There
		is a combination function and a permutation function that are
		both flexible as well as efficient with respect to speed and
		memory. There are optional constraint parameters that when
		utilized, generate all combinations/permutations of a vector
		meeting a specific criteria (E.g. finding all combinations such
		that the sum is less than a bound). Both functions are capable
		of handling mulitsets as well. Additionally, there are various
		sieving functions that quickly generate essential components
		for problems common in computational mathematics (E.g. number
		of coprime elements, divisors, prime factorizations, and
		complete factorizations for many numbers as well as primes
		numbers in a range).
