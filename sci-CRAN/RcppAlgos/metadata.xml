		Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics // Provides
		optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp' for solving
		problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics. There
		is a combination function and a permutation function that are
		both flexible as well as efficient with respect to speed and
		memory. There are optional contraint arguments that when
		employed, generate all combinations/permutations of a vector
		meeting a specific criteria (E.g. finding all combinations such
		that the sum is less than a bound). The generalized permutation
		function is also capable of producing all permutations of
		multisets. Additionally, there are various sieving functions
		that quickly generate essential components for problems common
		in computational mathematics (E.g. number of comprime elements,
		divisors, prime factorizations, and complete factorizations for
		many numbers as well as primes in a range).
