		Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics // Provides
		optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp'. There is a
		generalized combinations function that is highly efficient
		(both speed and memory). There are optional contraint arguments
		that when employed, generate all combinations of a vector
		meeting a specific criteria (E.g. finding all combinations such
		that the sum is less than a bound). Additionally, there are
		various sieving functions that quickly generate essential
		components for problems common in computational mathematics
		(E.g. number of comprime elements, divisors, prime
		factorizations, and complete factorizations for many numbers as
		well as generating primes in a range).
