		High Performance Tools for Combinatorics and Computational
		Mathematics // Provides optimized functions implemented in C++
		with 'Rcpp' for solving problems in combinatorics and
		computational mathematics. Utilizes parallel programming via
		'RcppThread' for maximal performance. Also makes use of the
		RMatrix class from the 'RcppParallel' library. There are
		combination/permutation functions with constraint parameters
		that allow for generation of all combinations/permutations of a
		vector meeting specific criteria (e.g. generating integer
		partitions/compositions or finding all combinations such that
		the sum is between two bounds). Capable of generating specific
		combinations/permutations (e.g. retrieve only the nth
		lexicographical result) which sets up nicely for
		parallelization as well as random sampling. Gmp support permits
		exploration where the total number of results is large (e.g.
		comboSample(10000, 500, n = 4)). Additionally, there are
		several high performance number theoretic functions that are
		useful for problems common in computational mathematics. Some
		of these functions make use of the fast integer division
		library 'libdivide'. The primeSieve function is based on the
		segmented sieve of Eratosthenes implementation by Kim Walisch.
		It is also efficient for large numbers by using the cache
		friendly improvements originally developed by Toms Oliveira.
		Finally, there is a prime counting function that implements
		Legendre's formula based on the work of Kim Walisch.
