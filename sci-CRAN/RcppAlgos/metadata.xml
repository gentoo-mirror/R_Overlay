		Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics // Provides
		optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp' for solving
		problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics. There
		is a combination function and a permutation function that are
		both flexible as well as efficient with respect to speed and
		memory. There are optional constraint parameters that when
		utilized, generate all combinations/ permutations of a vector
		meeting specific criteria (e.g. finding all combinations such
		that the sum is less than a bound). Both functions are capable
		of handling multisets as well. Additionally, there are several
		highly efficient number theoretic functions that are useful for
		problems common in computational mathematics. These include
		various sieving functions that can quickly generate the
		following: prime numbers, number of coprime elements, number of
		divisors, prime factorizations, and complete factorizations.
		Some of these functions make use of the fast integer division
		library 'libdivide' by http://ridiculousfish.com. The
		primeSieve function is based on the segmented sieve of
		Eratosthenes implementation by Kim Walisch. It is capable of
		generating all primes less than a billion in just over 1
		second. It can also quickly generate prime numbers over a range
		(e.g. primeSieve(10^13, 10^13+10^9)). There are stand-alone
		vectorized functions for general factoring (e.g. all divisors
		of number), primality testing, as well as prime factoring (this
		function implements a non-gmp variant of Pollard's rho
		algorithm). Finally, there is a prime counting function that
		implements a simple variation of Legendre's formula based off
		of the algorithm by Kim Walisch. It is capable of returning the
		number of primes below a trillion in under 0.5 seconds.
