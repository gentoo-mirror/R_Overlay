		web tool for estimating under-five deaths caused by poor-quality
		antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa // This package allows
		users to calculate the number of under-five child deaths caused
		by consumption of poor quality antimalarials across 39 sub-
		Saharan nations. The package supports one function, that starts
		an interactive web tool created using the shiny R package. The
		web tool runs locally on the user's machine. The web tool
		allows users to set input parameters (prevalence of poor
		quality antimalarials, case fatality rate of children who take
		poor quality antimalarials, and sample size) which are then
		used to perform an uncertainty analysis following the Latin
		hypercube sampling scheme. Users can download the output
		figures as PDFs, and the output data as CSVs. Users can also
		download their input parameters for reference. This package was
		designed to accompany the analysis presented in: J. Patrick
		Renschler, Kelsey Walters, Paul Newton, Ramanan Laxminarayan
		"Estimated under-five deaths associated with poor-quality
		antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa", 2014. Paper submitted.
