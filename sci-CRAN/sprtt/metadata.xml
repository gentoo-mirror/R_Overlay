		Sequential Probability Ratio Tests: Using t-Statistic // The
		seq_ttest() function is the implementation of Abraham Walds
		(1947) doi:10.2134/agronj1947.00021962003900070011x Sequential
		Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) for the test of a normal mean
		(difference) with unknown variance in R (R Core Team, 2018). It
		performs sequential t tests developed by Rushton (1950)
		doi:10.2307/2332385, Rushton (1952) doi:10.2307/2334026 and
		Hajnal (1961) doi:10.2307/2333131, based on the SPRT.
		Specifically, seq_ttest() performs one-sample, two-sample, and
		paired t tests for testing one- and two-sided hypotheses.  The
		test is to be applied to the data during the sampling process,
		ideally after each observation. At any stage, it will return a
		decision to either continue sampling or terminate and accept
		one of the specified hypotheses. For more information on the
		SPRT t test, see Schnuerch  Erdfelder (2019)
