		Calibration Plots for the Transition Probabilities from
		Multistate Models // Assess the calibration of an existing
		(i.e. previously developed) multistate model through
		calibration plots. Calibration is assessed using one of three
		methods. 1) Calibration methods for binary logistic regression
		models applied at a fixed time point in conjunction with
		inverse probability of censoring weights. 2) Calibration
		methods for multinomial logistic regression models applied at a
		fixed time point in conjunction with inverse probability of
		censoring weights. 3) Pseudo-values estimated using the Aalen-
		Johansen estimator of observed risk. All methods are applied in
		conjunction with landmarking when required. These calibration
		plots evaluate the calibration (in a validation cohort of
		interest) of the transition probabilities estimated from an
		existing multistate model. While package development has
		focused on multistate models, calibration plots can be produced
		for any model which utilises information post baseline to
		update predictions (e.g. dynamic models); competing risks
		models; or standard single outcome survival models, where
		predictions can be made at any landmark time. Please see Pate
		et al. (2024) doi:10.1002/sim.10094 and Pate et al. (2024)
