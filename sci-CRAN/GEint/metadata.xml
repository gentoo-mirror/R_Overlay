		Misspecified Models for Gene-Environment Interaction // The first
		major functionality is to compute the bias in misspecified
		linear gene-environment interaction models. The most
		generalized function for this objective is GE_bias().  However
		GE_bias() requires specification of many higher order moments
		of covariates in the model.  If users are unsure about how to
		calculate/estimate these higher order moments, it may be easier
		to use GE_bias_normal_squaredmis().  This function places many
		more assumptions on the covariates (most notably that they are
		all jointly generated from a multivariate normal distribution)
		and is thus able to automatically calculate many of the higher
		order moments automatically, necessitating only that the user
		specify some covariances.  There are also functions to solve
		for the bias through simulation and non-linear equation
		solvers, these can be used to check your work. Second major
		functionality is to implement the Bootstrap Inference with
		Correct Sandwich (BICS) testing procedure, which we have found
		to provide better finite-sample performance than other
		inference procedures for testing GxE interaction.  More details
		on these functions are available in Sun, Carroll, Christiani,
		and Lin (2018) doi:10.1111/biom.12813.
