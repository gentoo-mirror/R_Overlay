		Visualisation, Exploration, and Web Communication of
		Archaeological Spatial Data // An R 'Shiny' application for
		visual and statistical exploration and web communication of
		archaeological spatial data, either remains or sites. It offers
		interactive 3D and 2D visualisations (cross sections and maps
		of remains, timeline of the work made in a site) which can be
		exported in SVG and HTML formats. It performs simple spatial
		statistics (convex hull, regression surfaces, 2D kernel density
		estimation) and allows exporting data to other online
		applications for more complex methods. 'archeoViz' can be used
		offline locally or deployed on a server, either with
		interactive input of data or with a static data set. Example is
		provided at https://analytics.huma-num.fr/archeoviz/en.
