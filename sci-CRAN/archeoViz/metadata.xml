		Visualisation, Exploration, and Web Communication of
		Archaeological Spatial Data // An R 'Shiny' application for the
		visualisation, interactive exploration, and web communication
		of archaeological spatial data. It includes interactive 3D and
		2D visualisations, generation of cross sections and maps of the
		remains, and display an interactive timeline of the work made
		in a site. Simple spatial statistics can be performed (convex
		hull, regression surfaces, 2D kernel density estimation), as
		well as exporting data to other online applications for more
		complex methods. 'archeoViz' can be used locally or deployed on
		a server, either with interactive input of data or with a
		static data set. Example is provided at https://analytics.huma-
		num.fr/archeoviz/en.
