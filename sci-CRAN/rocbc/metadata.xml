		Statistical Inference for Box-Cox Based Receiver Operating
		Characteristic Curves // Generation of Box-Cox based ROC curves
		and several aspects of inferences and hypothesis testing. Can
		be used when inferences for one biomarker (Bantis LE, Nakas CT,
		Reiser B. (2018)doi:10.1002/bimj.201700107) are of interest or
		when comparisons of two correlated biomarkers (Bantis LE, Nakas
		CT, Reiser B. (2021)doi:10.1002/bimj.202000128) are of
		interest. Provides inferences and comparisons around the AUC,
		the Youden index, the sensitivity at a given specificity level
		(and vice versa), the optimal operating point of the ROC curve
		(in the Youden sense), and the Youden based cutoff.
