		Simulation of Parameterized Stochastic Boolean Networks // A
		Boolean network is a particular kind of discrete dynamical
		system where the variables are simple binary switches. Despite
		its simplicity, Boolean network modeling has been a successful
		method to describe the behavioral pattern of various phenomena.
		Applying stochastic noise to Boolean networks is a useful
		approach for representing the effects of various perturbing
		stimuli on complex systems. A number of methods have been
		developed to control noise effects on Boolean networks using
		parameters integrated into the update rules. This package
		provides functions to examine three such methods: Boolean
		network with perturbations (BNp), described by Trairatphisan et
		al. (2013) doi:10.1186/1478-811X-11-46, stochastic discrete
		dynamical systems (SDDS), proposed by Murrugarra et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1186/1687-4153-2012-5, and Boolean network with
		probabilistic edge weights (PEW), presented by Deritei et al.
		(2022) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010536. This package includes
		source code derived from the 'BoolNet' package, which is
