		Systematical Metabolic Reconstruction // In the past decade,
		genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have widely been used to
		comprehend the systems biology of metabolic pathways within an
		organism. Different GSMs are constructed using various
		techniques that require distinct steps, but the input data,
		information conversion and software tools are neither concisely
		defined nor mathematically or programmatically formulated in a
		context-specific manner.The tool that quantitatively and
		qualitatively specifies each reconstruction steps and can
		generate a template list of reconstruction steps dynamically
		selected from a reconstruction step reservoir, constructed
		based on all available published papers.
