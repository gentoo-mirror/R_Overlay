		Working with Healthcare Databases // A system for identifying
		diseases or events from healthcare databases and preparing data
		for epidemiological studies. It includes capabilities not
		supported by 'SQL', such as matching strings by 'stringr' style
		regular expressions, and can compute comorbidity scores (Quan
		et al. (2005) doi:10.1097/01.mlr.0000182534.19832.83) directly
		on a database server. The implementation is based on 'dbplyr'
		with full 'tidyverse' compatibility.
