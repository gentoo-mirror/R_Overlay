		Summarizing Distributions of Latent Structures // Summaries of
		distributions on clusterings and feature allocations are
		provided. Specifically, point estimates are obtained by the
		sequentially-allocated latent structure optimization (SALSO)
		algorithm to minimize squared error loss, absolute error loss,
		Binder loss, or the lower bound of the variation of information
		loss. Clustering uncertainty can be assessed with the
		confidence calculations and the associated plot.
