		Spatial Bayesian Factor Analysis // Implements a spatial Bayesian
		non-parametric factor analysis model with inference in a
		Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Spatial
		correlation is introduced in the columns of the factor loadings
		matrix using a Bayesian non-parametric prior, the probit stick-
		breaking process. Areal spatial data is modeled using a
		conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior and point-referenced
		spatial data is treated using a Gaussian process. The response
		variable can be modeled as Gaussian, probit, Tobit, or Binomial
		(using Polya-Gamma augmentation). Temporal correlation is
		introduced for the latent factors through a hierarchical
		structure and can be specified as exponential or first-order
		autoregressive. Full details of the package can be found in the
		accompanying vignette. Furthermore, the details of the package
		can be found in "Bayesian Non-Parametric Factor Analysis for
		Longitudinal Spatial Surfaces", by Berchuck et al (2019),
		arXiv:1911.04337. The paper is in press at the journal Bayesian
		Analysis.
