		Utilities for Strings and Function Arguments // The gsubfn
		function is like gsub but can take a replacement function or
		certain other objects instead of the replacement string.
		Matches and back references are input to the replacement
		function and replaced by the function output.   gsubfn can be
		used to split strings based on content rather than delimiters
		and for quasi-perl-style string interpolation. The package also
		has facilities for translating formulas to functions and
		allowing such formulas in function calls instead of functions.
		This can be used with R functions such as apply, sapply,
		lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot, Filter and any other function
		that expects another function as an input argument or functions
		like cat or sql calls that may involve strings where
		substitution is desirable. There is also a facility for
		returning multiple objects from functions and a version of
		transform that allows the RHS to refer to LHS used in the same
		transform.
