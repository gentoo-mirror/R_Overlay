		Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing Tools // Support the
		analysis of drone derived imagery and point clouds as a cheap
		and easy to use alternative/complement to light detection and
		ranging data. It provides functionality to analyze poor quality
		digital aerial images as taken by low budget ready to fly
		drones. This includes supported machine learning based
		classification functions, comprehensive texture analysis,
		segmentation algorithms as well as forest relevant analyzes of
		metrics and measures on the derived products.
