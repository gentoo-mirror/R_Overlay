		Exactly Computing the Tail of the Poisson-Binomial Distribution
		// An exact method for computing the Poisson-Binomial
		Distribution (PBD). The package provides a function for
		generating a random sample from the PBD, as well as two
		distinct approaches for computing the density, distribution,
		and quantile functions of the PBD. The first method uses
		direct-convolution, or a dynamic-programming approach which is
		numerically stable but can be slow for a large input due to its
		quadratic complexity. The second method is much faster on large
		inputs thanks to its use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based
		convolutions. Notably in this case the package uses an
		exponential shift to practically guarantee the relative
		accuracy of the computation of an arbitrarily small tail of the
		PBD -- something that FFT-based methods often struggle with.
		This ShiftConvolvePoiBin method is described in Peres, Lee and
		Keich (2020) arXiv:2004.07429 where it is also shown to be
		competitive with the fastest implementations for exactly
		computing the entire Poisson-Binomial distribution.
