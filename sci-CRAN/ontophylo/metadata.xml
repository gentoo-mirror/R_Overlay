		Ontology-Informed Phylogenetic Comparative Analyses // Provides
		new tools for analyzing discrete trait data integrating bio-
		ontologies and phylogenetics. It expands on the previous work
		of Tarasov et al. (2019) doi:10.1093/isd/ixz009. The PARAMO
		pipeline allows to reconstruct ancestral phenomes treating
		groups of morphological traits as a single complex character.
		The pipeline incorporates knowledge from ontologies during the
		amalgamation of individual character stochastic maps. Here we
		expand the current PARAMO functionality by adding new
		statistical methods for inferring evolutionary phenome dynamics
		using non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). The new
		functionalities include: (1) reconstruction of evolutionary
		rate shifts of phenomes across lineages and time; (2)
		reconstruction of morphospace dynamics through time; and (3)
		estimation of rates of phenome evolution at different levels of
		anatomical hierarchy (e.g., entire body or specific regions
		only). The package also includes user-friendly tools for
		visualizing evolutionary rates of different anatomical regions
		using vector images of the organisms of interest.
