		Survival Prediction Ensemble Classification Tool // A tool for
		survival analysis using a discrete time approach with ensemble
		binary classification. 'spect' provides a simple interface
		consistent with commonly used R data analysis packages, such as
		'caret', a variety of parameter options to help facilitate
		search automation, a high degree of transparency to the end-
		user - all intermediate data sets and parameters are made
		available for further analysis and useful, out-of-the-box
		visualizations of model performance. Methods for transforming
		survival data into discrete-time are adapted from the
		'autosurv' package by Suresh et al., (2022)
