		Forest Population Structure and Numeric Dynamics // Analysis of
		forest population structure and quantitative dynamics is the
		research and evaluation of the composition, distribution, age
		structure and changes in quantity over time of various
		populations in the forest. By deeply understanding these
		characteristics of forest populations, scientific basis can be
		provided for the management, protection and sustainable
		utilization of forest resources. This R package conducts a
		systematic analysis of forest population structure and
		quantitative dynamics through analyzing age structure,
		compiling life tables, population quantitative dynamic change
		indices and time series models, in order to provide support for
		forest population protection and sustainable management.
