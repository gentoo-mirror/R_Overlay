		Swarm Intelligence for Self-Organized Clustering // Algorithms
		implementing populations of agents that interact with one
		another and sense their environment may exhibit emergent
		behavior such as self-organization and swarm intelligence.
		Here, a swarm system called Databionic swarm (DBS) is
		introduced which was published in Thrun, M.C., Ultsch A.:
		"Swarm Intelligence for Self-Organized Clustering" (2020),
		Artificial Intelligence, DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2020.103237. DBS
		is able to adapt itself to structures of high-dimensional data
		such as natural clusters characterized by distance and/or
		density based structures in the data space. The first module is
		the parameter-free projection method called Pswarm (Pswarm()),
		which exploits the concepts of self-organization and emergence,
		game theory, swarm intelligence and symmetry considerations.
		The second module is the parameter-free high-dimensional data
		visualization technique, which generates projected points on
		the topographic map with hypsometric tints defined by the
		generalized U-matrix (GeneratePswarmVisualization()). The third
		module is the clustering method itself with non-critical
		parameters (DBSclustering()). Clustering can be verified by the
		visualization and vice versa. The term DBS refers to the method
		as a whole. It enables even a non-professional in the field of
		data mining to apply its algorithms for visualization and/or
		clustering to data sets with completely different structures
		drawn from diverse research fields. The comparison to common
		projection methods can be found in the book of Thrun, M.C.:
		"Projection Based Clustering through Self-Organization and
		Swarm Intelligence" (2018) DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9.
