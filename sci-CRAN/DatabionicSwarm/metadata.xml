		Swarm Intelligence for Self-Organized Clustering // Algorithms
		implementing populations of agents which interact with one
		another and sense their environment may exhibit emergent
		behavior such as self-organization and swarm intelligence. Here
		a swarm system, called databionic swarm (DBS), is introduced
		which is able to adapt itself to structures of high-dimensional
		data such as natural clusters characterized by distance and/or
		density based structures in the data space. The first module is
		the parameter-free projection method Pswarm, which exploits the
		concepts of self-organization and emergence, game theory, swarm
		intelligence and symmetry considerations. The second module is
		a parameter-free high-dimensional data visualization technique,
		which generates projected points on a topographic map with
		hypsometric colors based on the generalized U-matrix. The third
		module is the clustering method itself with non-critical
		parameters. The clustering can be verified by the visualization
		and vice versa. The term DBS refers to the method as a whole.
		DBS enables even a non-professional in the field of data mining
		to apply its algorithms for visualization and/or clustering to
		data sets with completely different structures drawn from
		diverse research fields.
