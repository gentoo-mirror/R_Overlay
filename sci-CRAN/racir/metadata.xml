		Rapid A/Ci Response (RACiR) Data Analysis // Contains functions
		useful for reading in Licor 6800 files, correcting and
		analyzing rapid A/Ci response (RACiR) data. Requires some user
		interaction to adjust the calibration (empty chamber) data file
		to a useable range. Calibration uses a 1st to 5th order
		polynomial as suggested in Stinziano et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1111/pce.12911. Data can be processed individually or
		batch processed for all files paired with a given calibration
		file. RACiR is a trademark of LI-COR Biosciences, and used with
		permission.
