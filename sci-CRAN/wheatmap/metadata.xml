		Incrementally Build Complex Plots using Natural Semantics //
		Builds complex plots, heatmaps in particular, using natural
		semantics. Bigger plots can be assembled using directives such
		as 'LeftOf', 'RightOf', 'TopOf', and 'Beneath' and more. Other
		features include clustering, dendrograms and integration with
		'ggplot2' generated grid objects. This package is particularly
		designed for bioinformaticians to assemble complex plots for
		publication.
