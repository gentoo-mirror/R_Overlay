		Bidirectional Two-Stage Least Squares Estimation // Implements
		bidirectional two-stage least squares (Bi-TSLS) estimation for
		identifying bidirectional causal effects between two variables
		in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The method uses
		proxy variables (negative control exposure and outcome) along
		with at least one covariate to handle confounding.
