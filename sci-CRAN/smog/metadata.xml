		Structural Modeling by using Overlapped Group Penalty // Fits a
		linear non-penalized phenotype (demographic) variables and
		penalized groups of prognostic effect and predictive effect, by
		satisfying such hierarchy structures that if a predictive
		effect exists, its prognostic effect must also exist. This
		package can deal with continuous, binomial or multinomial, and
		survival response variables, underlying the assumption of
		Gaussian, binomial (multinomial), and Cox proportional hazard
		models, respectively. It is implemented by combining the
		iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm and the alternating
		direction method of multipliers algorithms. The main method is
		built in C++, and the complementary methods are written in R.
