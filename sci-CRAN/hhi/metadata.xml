		Calculate and Visualize the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index // Based
		on the aggregated shares retained by individual firms or actors
		within a market or space, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
		measures the level of concentration in the market or space. It
		is often used as a measure of competition, where 0 equals
		perfect competition amongst firms or actors and 10,000 equals
		perfect monopoly. This package allows for intuitive and
		straightforward computation of the HHI, requiring placement of
		objects directly into the function, including the data frame
		first, followed by the name of the vector (or variable)
		corresponding with the market shares in quotation marks. The
		package also includes a plot function for quick visual display
		of HHI time series across any measure of time (year, quarter,
		month, etc.) Suggested citation of the HHI: Rhoades, Stephen A.
		(1993, "The herfindahl-hirschman index." Federal Reserve
		Bulletin 79: 188).
