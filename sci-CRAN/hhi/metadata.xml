		Calculate and Visualize the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index // Based
		on the aggregated shares retained by individual firms or actors
		within a market or space, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
		measures the level of concentration in a space. This package
		allows for intuitive and straightforward computation of HHI
		scores, requiring placement of objects of interest directly
		into the function. The package also includes a plot function
		for quick visual display of an HHI time series using any
		measure of time (year, quarter, month, etc.). For usage, please
		cite the Journal of Open Source Software paper associated with
		the package: Waggoner, Philip D. (2018)
