		Calculate MIMS Dissolved Gas Concentrations Without Getting a
		Headache // Calculate dissolved gas concentrations from raw
		MIMS (Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer) signal data. Use
		mimsy() on a formatted CSV file to return dissolved gas
		concentrations (mg and microMole) of N2, O2, Ar based on gas
		solubility at temperature, pressure, and salinity. See
		references Benson and Krause (1984), Garcia and Gordon (1992),
		Stull (1947), and Hamme and Emerson (2004) for more
		information. Easily save the output to a nicely-formatted
		multi-tab 'Excel' workbook with mimsy.save(). Supports dual-
		temperature standard calibration for dual-bath MIMS setups.
