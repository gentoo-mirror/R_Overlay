		Random number generator WELL19937a with 53 or 32 bit output //
		Long period linear random number generator WELL19937a by F.
		Panneton, P. L'Ecuyer and M. Matsumoto. The initialization
		algorithm allows to seed the generator with a numeric vector of
		an arbitrary length and uses MRG32k5a by P. L'Ecuyer to achieve
		good quality of the initialization. The output function may be
		set to provide numbers from the interval (0,1) with 53 (the
		default) or 32 random bits. WELL19937a is of similar type as
		Mersenne Twister and has the same period. WELL19937a is
		slightly slower than Mersenne Twister, but has better
		equidistribution and "bit-mixing" properties and faster
		recovery from states with prevailing zeros than Mersenne
		Twister. All WELL generators with orders 512, 1024, 19937 and
		44497 can be found in randtoolbox package.
