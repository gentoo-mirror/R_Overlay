		Splitting Conic Solver // Solves convex cone programs via
		operator splitting. Can solve: linear programs ('LPs'), second-
		order cone programs ('SOCPs'), semidefinite programs ('SDPs'),
		exponential cone programs ('ECPs'), and power cone programs
		('PCPs'), or problems with any combination of those cones.
		'SCS' uses 'AMD' (a set of routines for permuting sparse
		matrices prior to factorization) and 'LDL' (a sparse 'LDL'
		factorization and solve package) from 'SuiteSparse'
		(https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html).
