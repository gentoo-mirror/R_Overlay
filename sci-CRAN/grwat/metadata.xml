		River Hydrograph Separation and Analysis // River hydrograph
		separation and daily runoff time series analysis. Provides
		various filters to separate baseflow and quickflow. Implements
		advanced separation technique by Rets et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1134/S0097807822010146 which involves meteorological
		data to reveal genetic components of the runoff: ground, rain,
