		Mixture and Non Mixture Parametric Cure Models to Estimate Cure
		Indicators // Fits a variety of cure models using excess hazard
		modeling methodology such as the mixture model proposed by
		Phillips et al. (2002) doi:10.1002/sim.1101 The Weibull
		distribution is used to represent the survival function of the
		uncured patients; Fits also non-mixture cure model such as the
		time-to-null excess hazard model proposed by Boussari et al.
