		Optimal Selection of SNPs Using a Unified Local Function //
		Applies a unified local function to select SNPs for low-density
		SNPs. The method is described in Wu et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1111/age.12916. Briefly, the local function gives
		different weights to the uniformity (U score) and average
		Shannon entropy (E score), depending on the inputs of the
		weights, thus facilitating SNP designs under varied scenarios
		for low-density SNP chips, including selecting uniformly-
		distributed SNPs or SNPs with the highest minor allele
		frequencies. This is an educational version. For more
		information about this package, please contact Dr. Nick Wu.
