		Vector Fields from Spatial Time Series of Population Abundance //
		Functions for converting time series of spatial abundance or
		density data in raster format to vector fields of population
		movement using the digital image correlation technique. More
		specifically, the functions in the package compute cross-
		covariance using discrete fast Fourier transforms for
		computational efficiency. Vectors in vector fields point in the
		direction of highest two dimensional cross-covariance. The
		package has a novel implementation of the digital image
		correlation algorithm that is designed to detect persistent
		directional movement when image time series extend beyond a
		sequence of two raster images.
