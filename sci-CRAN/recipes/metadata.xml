		Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Steps for Modeling // A
		recipe prepares your data for modeling. We provide an
		extensible framework for pipeable sequences of feature
		engineering steps provides preprocessing tools to be applied to
		data. Statistical parameters for the steps can be estimated
		from an initial data set and then applied to other data sets.
		The resulting processed output can then be used as inputs for
		statistical or machine learning models.
