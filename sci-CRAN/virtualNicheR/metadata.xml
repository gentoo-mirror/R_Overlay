		Generating Virtual Fundamental and Realised Niches // The ability
		to generate virtual niches enables virtual ecology experiments
		that have been advocated for evaluating species-environment
		relationship models. Using multivariate normal distributions
		and matrix algebra this package provides a unique computational
		framework to generate integrated fundamental and realised
		niches, which is important given differences in possible
		complexity of realised niche shapes that result from biotic
		interactions Etherington and Omondiagbe (2019)
