		Analysing 'SNP' and 'Silicodart' Data - Basic Functions //
		Facilitates the import and analysis of 'SNP' (single nucleotide
		'polymorphism') and 'silicodart' (presence/absence) data. The
		main focus is on data generated by 'DarT' (Diversity Arrays
		Technology), however, data from other sequencing platforms can
		be used once 'SNP' or related fragment presence/absence data
		from any source is imported. Genetic datasets are stored in a
		derived 'genlight' format (package 'adegenet'), that allows for
		a very compact storage of data and metadata. Functions are
		available for importing and exporting of 'SNP' and 'silicodart'
		data, for reporting on and filtering on various criteria (e.g.
		'callrate', 'heterozygosity', 'reproducibility', maximum allele
		frequency). Additional functions are available for
		visualization (e.g. Principle Coordinate Analysis) and creating
		a spatial representation using maps. 'dartR.base' is the 'base'
		package of the 'dartRverse' suits of packages. To install the
		other packages, we recommend to install the 'dartRverse'
		package, that supports the installation of all packages in the
		'dartRverse'. If you want to cite 'dartR', you find the
		information by typing citation('dartR.base') in the console.
