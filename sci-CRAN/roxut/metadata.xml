		Document Unit Tests Roxygen-Style // Much as 'roxygen2' allows
		one to document functions in the same file as the function
		itself, 'roxut'  allows one to write the unit tests in the same
		file as the function.  Once processed, the unit tests are moved
		to the appropriate directory.  Currently supports 'testthat'
		and 'tinytest' frameworks. The 'roxygen2' package provides much
		of the infrastructure.
