		Scoring Algorithm for the Implicit Association Test (IAT) // This
		minimalist package is designed to quickly score raw data
		outputted from an Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald,
		McGhee,  Schwartz, 1998) doi:10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464. IAT
		scores are calculated as specified by Greenwald, Nosek, and
		Banaji (2003) doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197. Outputted values
		can be interpreted as effect sizes. The input function consists
		of three arguments. First, indicate the name of the dataset to
		be analyzed. This is the only required input. Second, indicate
		the number of trials in your entire IAT (the default is set to
		220, which is typical for most IATs). Last, indicate whether
		congruent trials (e.g., flowers and pleasant) or incongruent
		trials (e.g., guns and pleasant) were presented first for this
		participant (the default is set to congruent). The script will
		tell you how long it took to run the code, the effect size for
		the participant, and whether that participant should be
		excluded based on the criteria outlined by Greenwald et al.
		(2003). Data files should consist of six columns organized in
		order as follows: Block (0-6), trial (0-19 for training blocks,
		0-39 for test blocks), category (dependent on your IAT), the
		type of item within that category (dependent on your IAT), a
		dummy variable indicating whether the participant was correct
		or incorrect on that trial (0=correct, 1=incorrect), and the
		participants reaction time (in milliseconds). Three sample
		datasets are included in this package (labeled 'IAT',
		'TooFastIAT', and 'BriefIAT') to practice with.
