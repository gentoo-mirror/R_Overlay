		Declarative Feature Extraction from Tabular Data Records //
		Extract features from tabular data in a declarative fashion,
		with a focus on processing medical records. Features are
		specified as JSON and are independently processed before being
		joined. Input data can be provided as CSV files or as data
		frames. This setup ensures that data is transformed in a
		modular and reproducible manner, and allows the same pipeline
		to be easily applied to new data.
