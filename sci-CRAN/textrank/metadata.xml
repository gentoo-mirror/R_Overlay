		Summarize Text by Ranking Sentences // The 'textrank' algorithm
		is an extension of the 'Pagerank' algorithm for text. The
		algorithm allows to summarize text by calculating how sentences
		are related to one another. This is done by looking at
		overlapping terminology used in sentences in order to set up
		links between sentences. The resulting sentence network is next
		plugged into the 'Pagerank' algorithm which identifies the most
		important sentences in your text and ranks them. More
		information can be found in the paper from Mihalcea, Rada
		Tarau, Paul (2004) http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-3252.
