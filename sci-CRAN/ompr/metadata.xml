		Model and Solve Mixed Integer Linear Programs // Model mixed
		integer linear programs in an algebraic way directly in R. The
		model is solver-independent and thus offers the possibility to
		solve a model with different solvers. It currently only
		supports linear constraints and objective functions. See the
		'ompr' website https://dirkschumacher.github.io/ompr for more
		information, documentation and examples.
