		Visualization of T-Cell Clonal Expansion // Visualize T-cell
		clonal expansion via circle-packing. 'APackOfTheClones' can
		integrate single-cell RNA sequencing and T-cell receptor
		libraries from the 10X genomics Single Cell Immune Profiling
		and Cell Ranger pipeline, to produce a simple, publication-
		ready visualization of the clonal expansion. The method was
		originally implemented by Murray Christian and Ben Murrell in
		the following immunology study: Ma et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1126/sciimmunol.abg6356.
