		Visualization of Clonal Expansion for Single Cell Immune Profiles
		// Visualize clonal expansion via circle-packing.
		'APackOfTheClones' extends 'scRepertoire' to produce a
		publication-ready visualization of clonal expansion at a single
		cell resolution, by representing expanded clones as differently
		sized circles. The method was originally implemented by Murray
		Christian and Ben Murrell in the following immunology study: Ma
		et al. (2021) doi:10.1126/sciimmunol.abg6356.
