		Read EPUB File Metadata and Text // Provides functions supporting
		the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB
		files. The 'epubr' package provides functions supporting the
		reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files.
		E-book metadata and text content are parsed separately and
		joined together in a tidy, nested tibble data frame. E-book
		formatting is not completely standardized across all
		literature. It can be challenging to curate parsed e-book
		content across an arbitrary collection of e-books perfectly and
		in completely general form, to yield a singular, consistently
		formatted output. Many EPUB files do not even contain all the
		same pieces of information in their respective metadata. EPUB
		file parsing functionality in this package is intended for
		relatively general application to arbitrary EPUB e-books.
		However, poorly formatted e-books or e-books with highly
		uncommon formatting may not work with this package. There may
		even be cases where an EPUB file has DRM or some other property
		that makes it impossible to read with 'epubr'. Text is read 'as
		is' for the most part. The only nominal changes are minor
		substitutions, for example curly quotes changed to straight
		quotes. Substantive changes are expected to be performed
		subsequently by the user as part of their text analysis.
		Additional text cleaning can be performed at the user's
		discretion, such as with functions from packages like 'tm' or
		'qdap'.
