		Read EPUB File Metadata and Text // Provides functions supporting
		the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB
		files. E-book formatting is non-standard enough across all
		literature that no function can curate parsed e-book content
		across an arbitrary collection of e-books, in completely
		general form, resulting in a singular, consistently formatted
		output containing all the same variables. EPUB file parsing
		functionality in this package is intended for relatively
		general application to arbitrary e-books. However, poorly
		formatted e-books or e-books with highly uncommon formatting
		may not work with this package. Text is read 'as is'.
		Additional text cleaning should be performed by the user at
		their discretion, such as with functions from packages like
		'tm' or 'qdap'.
