		WordNet Interface // An interface to WordNet using the Jawbone
		Java API to WordNet. WordNet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) is
		a large lexical database of English.  Nouns, verbs, adjectives
		and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms
		(synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.  Synsets are
		interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical
		relations. Please note that WordNet(R) is a registered
		tradename.  Princeton University makes WordNet available to
		research and commercial users free of charge provided the terms
		of their license
		(http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/license/) are followed,
		and proper reference is made to the project using an
		appropriate citation
		(http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/citing-wordnet/).
