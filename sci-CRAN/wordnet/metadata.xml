		WordNet Interface // An interface to WordNet using the Jawbone
		Java API to WordNet. WordNet (https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)
		is a large lexical database of English.  Nouns, verbs,
		adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive
		synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.
		Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and
		lexical relations. Please note that WordNet(R) is a registered
		tradename.  Princeton University makes WordNet available to
		research and commercial users free of charge provided the terms
		of their license (https://wordnet.princeton.edu/license-and-
		commercial-use) are followed, and proper reference is made to
		the project using an appropriate citation
		(https://wordnet.princeton.edu/citing-wordnet). The WordNet
		database files need to be made available separately, either via
		package 'wordnetDicts' from https://datacube.wu.ac.at,
		installing system packages where available, or direct download
		from https://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNdb-3.0.tar.gz.
