		Merging Linkage Maps by Linear Programming // Creates a consensus
		genetic map by merging linkage maps from different populations.
		The software uses linear programming (LP) to efficiently
		minimize the mean absolute error between the consensus map and
		the linkage maps.  This minimization is performed subject to
		linear inequality constraints that ensure the ordering of the
		markers in the linkage maps is preserved.  When marker order is
		inconsistent between linkage maps, a minimum set of ordinal
		constraints is deleted to resolve the conflicts.
