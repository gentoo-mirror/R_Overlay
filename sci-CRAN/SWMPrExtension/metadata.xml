		Functions for Analyzing and Plotting Estuary Monitoring Data //
		Tools for performing routine analysis and plotting tasks with
		environmental data from the System Wide Monitoring Program of
		the National Estuarine Research Reserve System
		https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/. This package builds on the
		functionality of the 'SWMPr' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=SWMPr, which is used to
		retrieve and organize the data. The combined set of tools
		address common challenges associated with continuous time
		series data for environmental decision making, and are intended
		for use in annual reporting activities. References: Beck,
