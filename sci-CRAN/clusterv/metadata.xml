		Assessment of Cluster Stability by Randomized Maps // The
		reliability of clusters is estimated using random projections.
		A set of stability measures is provided to assess the
		reliability of the clusters discovered by a generic clustering
		algorithm. The stability measures are taylored to high
		dimensional data (e.g. DNA microarray data) (Valentini, G
