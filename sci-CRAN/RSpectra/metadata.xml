		Solvers for Large-Scale Eigenvalue and SVD Problems // R
		interface to the 'Spectra' library https://spectralib.org/ for
		large-scale eigenvalue and SVD problems. It is typically used
		to compute a few eigenvalues/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g.,
		the k largest eigenvalues, which is usually more efficient than
		eigen() if k  n. This package provides the 'eigs()' function
		that does the similar job as in 'Matlab', 'Octave', 'Python
		SciPy' and 'Julia'. It also provides the 'svds()' function to
		calculate the largest k singular values and corresponding
		singular vectors of a real matrix. The matrix to be computed on
		can be dense, sparse, or in the form of an operator defined by
		the user.
