		Flexible Occupancy Estimation with Stan // Fit occupancy models
		in 'Stan' via 'brms'. The full variety of 'brms' formula-based
		effects structures are available to use in multiple classes of
		occupancy model, including single-season models, models with
		data augmentation for never-observed species, dynamic
		(multiseason) models with explicit colonization and extinction
		processes, and dynamic models with autologistic occupancy
		dynamics. Formulas can be specified for all relevant
		distributional terms, including detection and one or more of
		occupancy, colonization, extinction, and autologistic depending
		on the model type. Several important forms of model post-
		processing are provided.  References: Brkner (2017)
