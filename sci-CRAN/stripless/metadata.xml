		Structured Trellis Displays Without Strips for Lattice Graphics
		// For making Trellis-type conditioning plots without strip
		labels. This is useful for displaying the structure of results
		from factorial designs and other studies when many conditioning
		variables would clutter the display with layers of redundant
		strip labels. Settings of the variables are encoded by layout
		and spacing in the trellis array and decoded by a separate
		legend. The functionality is implemented by a single S3 generic
		strucplot() function that is a wrapper for the Lattice
		package's xyplot() function. This allows access to all Lattice
		graphics capabilities in the usual way.
