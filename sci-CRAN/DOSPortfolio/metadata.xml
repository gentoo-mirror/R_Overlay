		Dynamic Optimal Shrinkage Portfolio // Constructs dynamic optimal
		shrinkage estimators for the weights of the global minimum
		variance portfolio which are reconstructed at given
		reallocation points as derived in Bodnar, Parolya, and Thorsn
		(2021) (arXiv:2106.02131). Two dynamic shrinkage estimators are
		available in this package. One using overlapping samples while
