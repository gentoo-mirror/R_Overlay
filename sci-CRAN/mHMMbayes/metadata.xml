		Multilevel Hidden Markov Models Using Bayesian Estimation // An
		implementation of the multilevel (also known as mixed or random
		effects) hidden Markov model using Bayesian estimation in R.
		The multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization of
		the well-known hidden Markov model, for the latter see Rabiner
		(1989) doi:10.1109/5.18626. The multilevel HMM is tailored to
		accommodate (intense) longitudinal data of multiple individuals
		simultaneously, see e.g., de Haan-Rietdijk et al.
		doi:10.1080/00273171.2017.1370364. Using a multilevel
		framework, we allow for heterogeneity in the model parameters
		(transition probability matrix and conditional distribution),
		while estimating one overall HMM. The model can be fitted on
		multivariate data with a categorical distribution, and include
		individual level covariates (allowing for e.g., group
		comparisons on model parameters). Parameters are estimated
		using Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward
		recursion within a hybrid Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. The
		package also includes various visualization options, a function
		to simulate data, and a function to obtain the most likely
		hidden state sequence for each individual using the Viterbi
		algorithm.
