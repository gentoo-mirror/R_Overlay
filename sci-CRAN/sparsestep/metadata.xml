		SparseStep Regression // Implements the SparseStep model for
		solving regression problems with a sparsity constraint on the
		parameters. The SparseStep regression model was proposed in Van
		den Burg, Groenen, and Alfons (2017) arXiv:1701.06967. In the
		model, a regularization term is added to the regression problem
		which approximates the counting norm of the parameters. By
		iteratively improving the approximation a sparse solution to
		the regression problem can be obtained.  In this package both
		the standard SparseStep algorithm is implemented as well as a
		path algorithm which uses golden section search to determine
		solutions with different values for the regularization
		parameter.
