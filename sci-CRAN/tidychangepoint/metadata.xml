		A Tidy Framework for Changepoint Detection Analysis //
		Changepoint detection algorithms for R are widespread but have
		different interfaces and reporting conventions. This makes the
		comparative analysis of results difficult. We solve this
		problem by providing a tidy, unified interface for several
		different changepoint detection algorithms. We also provide
		consistent numerical and graphical reporting leveraging the
		'broom' and 'ggplot2' packages.
