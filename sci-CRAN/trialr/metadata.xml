		Clinical Trial Designs in 'rstan' // A collection of clinical
		trial designs and methods, implemented in 'rstan' and R,
		including: the Continual Reassessment Method by O'Quigley et
		al. (1990) doi:10.2307/2531628; EffTox by Thall  Cook (2004)
		doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00218.x; and the Augmented Binary
		method by Wason  Seaman (2013) doi:10.1002/sim.5867; and more.
		We provide functions to aid model-fitting and analysis. The
		'rstan' implementations may also serve as a cookbook to anyone
		looking to extend or embellish these models. We hope that this
		package encourages the use of Bayesian methods in clinical
		trials. There is a preponderance of early phase trial designs
		because this is where Bayesian methods are used most. If there
		is a method you would like implemented, please get in touch.
