		Clinical Trial Designs in 'RStan' // A showcase of Bayesian
		clinical trial designs, implemented in 'RStan' and R, including
		the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and EffTox. Given the
		emphasis on flexibility in Bayesian analysis, the
		implementations in a common language and style may serve as a
		cookbook to encourage the use of Bayesian methods in trials.
		Compiled 'RStan' models are installed, alongside helper classes
		and functions to work with models. There is a preponderance of
		early phase trial designs because this is where Bayesian
		methods are used most. If there is a published Bayesian design
		you want implemented in 'Stan', get in touch.
