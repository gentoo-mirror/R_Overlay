		Clinical Trial Designs in 'RStan' // A showcase of Bayesian
		clinical trial designs, implemented in 'RStan' and R. Some
		designs are implemented in R for the first time (e.g. 'EffTox'
		by Thall and Cook, 2004, https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/s
		oftwaredownload/SingleSoftware.aspx?Software_Id=2). Given the
		emphasis on flexibility in Bayesian analysis, the
		implementations in a common language and style may serve as a
		cookbook to encourage the use of Bayesian methods in trials.
		Compiled 'RStan' models are provided in addition to helper
		functions to perform simulations and inference on observed
		trial outcomes. There is a preponderance of early phase trial
		designs because this is where Bayesian methods are used most.
		If there is a published Bayesian design you want implemented in
		'Stan', get in touch.
