		Financial Projections and Planning for Health Care Practices //
		Provides a shiny interface for a free, open-source managerial
		accounting-like system for health care practices. This package
		allows health care administrators to project revenue with
		monthly adjustments and procedure-specific boosts up to a
		3-year period. Granular data (patient-level) to aggregated data
		(department- or hospital-level) can all be used as valid inputs
		provided historical volume and revenue data is available. For
		more details on managerial accounting techniques, see Brewer et
		al. (2015, ISBN:9780078025792).
