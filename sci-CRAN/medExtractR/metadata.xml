		Extraction of Medication Information from Clinical Text //
		Function and support for medication and dosing information
		extraction from free-text clinical notes. Medication entities
		for the basic medExtractR implementation that can be extracted
		include drug name, strength, dose amount, dose, frequency,
		intake time, dose change, and time of last dose. The basic
		medExtractR is outlined in Weeks, Beck, McNeer, Williams,
		Bejan, Denny, Choi (2020) doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocz207. The
		extended medExtractR_tapering implementation is intended to
		extract dosing information for more tapering schedules, which
		are far more complex. The tapering extension allows for the
		extraction of additional entities including dispense amount,
		refills, dose schedule, time keyword, transition, and
		preposition.
