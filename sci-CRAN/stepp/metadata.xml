		Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) // A method
		to explore the treatment-covariate interactions in survival or
		generalized linear model (GLM) for continuous, binomial and
		count data arising from two or more treatment arms of a
		clinical trial. A permutation distribution approach to
		inference is implemented, based on permuting the covariate
		values within each treatment group.
