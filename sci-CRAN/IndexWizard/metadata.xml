		Constructing and Analyzing Complex Selection Indices // Allows
		the construction selection indices based on estimated breeding
		values in animal and plant breeding and to calculate several
		analytic measures around to assess its impact on genetic and
		phenotypic progress. The methodology thereby allows to analyze
		genetic gain of traits in the breeding goal which are not part
		of the actual index and automatically computes several analytic
		measures. It further allows to retrospectively derive realized
		economic weights from observed genetic trends. The framework is
		described in Simianer, H., Heise, J., Rensing, S., Pook, T.
		Geibel, J. and Reimer, C. (2023)
