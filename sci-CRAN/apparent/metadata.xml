		Accurate Parentage Analysis in the Absence of Guiding Information
		// Performs parentage analysis based on a test of genetic
		identity between expected progeny (EPij), built using Single
		Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) homozygous loci from all pairs of
		possible parents (i and j), and all potential offspring (POk).
		Using the Gower Dissimilarity metric (GD), genetic identity
		between EPij and POk is taken as evidence that individuals i
		and j are the true parents of offspring k.  Evaluation of triad
		(two parents + offspring) significance is based on the
		distribution of all GD (EPij|k) values. Specifically, a Dixon
		test is used to identify a gap-based threshold that separates
		true triads and from spurious associations. For any offspring
		not successfully assigned to a pair of parents, perhaps due to
		the absence of one parent from the test population, a non-
		mandatory Dyad analysis can be employed to identify a likely
		single parent for a given offspring. In this analysis, a two-
		stage test is applied to discriminate an offspring's true
		parent from its other close relatives (e.g. siblings) that may
		also be present in the population. In the first stage,
		'apparent' calculates the mean GD (GDM) between a POk and all
		expected progeny arising from the j possible triads involving
		potential parent i. In the second stage, it calculates a
		coefficient of variation (GDCV) among the pairwise GD's between
		POk and each expected progeny arising from the j triads
		involving potential parent i. An individual that is
		simultaneously a low outlier in the first test and a high
		outlier in the second is identified as a likely parent of POk.
		In an effort to facilitate interpretation, results of both the
		triad and optional dyad analyses are presented in tabular and
		graphical form.
