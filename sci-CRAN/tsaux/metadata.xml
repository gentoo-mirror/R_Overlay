		Time Series Forecasting Auxiliary Functions // A suite of
		auxiliary functions that enhance time series estimation and
		forecasting, including a robust anomaly detection routine based
		on Chen and Liu (1993) doi:10.2307/2290724 (imported and
		wrapped from the 'tsoutliers' package), utilities for managing
		calendar and time conversions, performance metrics to assess
		both point forecasts and distributional predictions, advanced
		simulation by allowing the generation of time series
		componentssuch as trend, seasonal, ARMA, irregular, and
		anomaliesin a modular fashion based on the innovations form of
		the state space model and a number of transformation methods
		including Box-Cox, Logit, 'Softplus-Logit' and Sigmoid.
