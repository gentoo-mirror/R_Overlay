		Agreement of Nominal Scale Raters with a Gold Standard //
		Estimate agreement of a group of raters with a gold standard
		rating on a nominal scale. For a single gold standard rater the
		average pairwise agreement of raters with this gold standard is
		provided. For a group of gold standard raters the approach of
		S. Vanbelle, A. Albert (2009) doi:10.1007/s11336-009-9116-1 is
		implemented. Bias and standard error are estimated via delete-1
		jackknife.
