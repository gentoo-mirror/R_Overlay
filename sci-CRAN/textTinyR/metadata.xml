		Text Processing for Small or Big Data Files // It offers
		functions for splitting, parsing, tokenizing and creating a
		vocabulary for big text data files. Moreover, it includes
		functions for building a document-term matrix and extracting
		information from those (term-associations, most frequent
		terms). It also embodies functions for calculating token
		statistics (collocations, look-up tables, string
		dissimilarities) and functions to work with sparse matrices.
		Lastly, it includes functions for Word Vector Representations
		(i.e. 'GloVe', 'fasttext') and incorporates functions for the
		calculation of (pairwise) text document dissimilarities. The
		source code is based on 'C++11' and exported in R through the
		'Rcpp', 'RcppArmadillo' and 'BH' packages.
