		Read and Write TIFF Files // Reads and writes TIFF format images
		and returns them as a pixmap object. Because the resulting
		object can be very large for even modestly sized TIFF images,
		images can be reduced as they are read for improved
		performance.  This package is a wrapper around libtiff
		(www.libtiff.org), on which it depends (i.e. the libtiff shared
		library must be on your PATH for the binary to work, and
		tiffio.h must be on your system to build the package from
		source). By using libtiff's highlevel TIFFReadRGBAImage
		function, this package inherently supports a wide range of
		image formats and compression schemes. This package also
		provides an implementation of the Ridler Autothresholding
		algorithm for easy generation of binary masks as described in
		Ridler  Calvard (1978) doi:10.1109/TSMC.1978.4310039.
