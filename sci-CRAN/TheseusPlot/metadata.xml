		Visualizing Decomposition of Differences in Rate Metrics //
		Provides tools for decomposing differences in rate metrics
		between two groups into contributions from individual subgroups
		and visualizing them as a "Theseus Plot". Inspired by the story
		of the Ship of Theseus, the method replaces subgroup data from
		one group with that of another step by step, recalculating the
		overall metric at each stage to quantify subgroup
		contributions. A Theseus Plot combines the stepwise progression
		of a waterfall plot with the comparative bars of a bar chart,
		offering an intuitive way to understand subgroup-level effects.
