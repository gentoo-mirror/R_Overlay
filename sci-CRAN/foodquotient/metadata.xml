		Food Quotient and Nutrient Analysis for HSFFQ // Aids in
		analysing data from a food frequency questionnaire known as the
		Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire (HSFFQ). Functions
		from this package use answers from the HSFFQ to generate
		estimates of daily consumed micronutrients, calories,
		macronutrients on an individual level. The package also
		calculates food quotients on individual and group levels.
		Foodquotient calculation is an often tedious step in the
		calculation of total human energy expenditure (TEE) using the
		doubly labeled water method, which is the gold standard for
		measuring TEE.
