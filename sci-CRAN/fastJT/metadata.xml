		Efficient Jonckheere-Terpstra Test Statistics for Robust Machine
		Learning and Genome-Wide Association Studies // This
		'Rcpp'-based package implements highly efficient functions for
		the calculation of the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic. It can be
		used for a variety of applications, including feature selection
		in machine learning problems, or to conduct genome-wide
		association studies (GWAS) with multiple quantitative
		phenotypes. The code leverages 'OpenMP' directives for multi-
		core computing to reduce overall processing time.
