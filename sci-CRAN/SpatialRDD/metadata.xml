		Conduct Multiple Types of Geographic Regression Discontinuity
		Designs // Spatial versions of Regression Discontinuity Designs
		(RDDs) are becoming increasingly popular as tools for causal
		inference. However, conducting state-of-the-art analyses often
		involves tedious and time-consuming steps. This package offers
		comprehensive functionalities for executing all required
		spatial and econometric tasks in a streamlined manner.
		Moreover, it equips researchers with tools for performing
		essential placebo and balancing checks comprehensively. The
		fact that researchers do not have to rely on 'APIs' of external
		'GIS' software ensures replicability and raises the standard
		for spatial RDDs.
