		Leveraging eQTLs to Identify Individual-Level Tissue of Interest
		for a Complex Trait // Genetic predisposition for complex
		traits is often manifested through multiple tissues of interest
		at different time points in the development. As an example, the
		genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested through
		inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation
		of genes expressed in the brain and/or through the control of
		fat storage in the adipose tissue by dysregulation of genes
		expressed in adipose tissue. We present a method eGST (eQTL-
		based genetic subtyper) that integrates tissue-specific eQTLs
		with GWAS data for a complex trait to probabilistically assign
		a tissue of interest to the phenotype of each individual in the
		study. eGST estimates the posterior probability that an
		individual's phenotype can be assigned to a tissue based on
		individual-level genotype data of tissue-specific eQTLs and
		marginal phenotype data in a genome-wide association study
		(GWAS) cohort. Under a Bayesian framework of mixture model,
		eGST employs a maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-
		maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the tissue-specific
		posterior probability across individuals. Methodology is
		available from: A Majumdar, C Giambartolomei, N Cai, MK Freund,
		T Haldar, T Schwarz, J Flint, B Pasaniuc (2019)
