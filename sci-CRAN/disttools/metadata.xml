		Distance Object Manipulation Tools // Provides convenient methods
		for accessing the data in 'dist' objects with minimal memory
		and computational overhead. 'disttools' can be used to extract
		the distance between any pair or combination of points encoded
		by a 'dist' object using only the indices of those points. This
		is an improvement over existing functionality, which requires
		either coercing a 'dist' object into a matrix or calculating
		the one dimensional index corresponding to a pair of
		observations. Coercion to a matrix is undesirable because doing
		so doubles the amount of memory required for storage. In
		contrast, there is no inherent downside to the latter solution.
		However, in part due to several edge cases, correctly and
		efficiently implementing such a solution can be challenging.
		'disttools' abstracts away these challenges and provides a
		simple interface to access the data in a 'dist' object using
		the latter approach.
