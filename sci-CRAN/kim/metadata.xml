		A Toolkit for Behavioral Scientists // A collection of functions
		for analyzing data typically collected or used by behavioral
		scientists. Examples of the functions include a function that
		compares groups in a factorial experimental design, a function
		that conducts two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a
		function that cleans a data set generated by Qualtrics surveys.
		Some of the functions will require installing additional
		package(s). Such packages and other references are cited within
		the section describing the relevant functions. Many functions
		in this package rely heavily on these two popular R packages:
		Dowle et al. (2021)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table. Wickham et al.
		(2021) https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2.
