		BLUE for Combining Location and Scale Information in a Meta-
		Analysis // The sample mean and standard deviation are two
		commonly used statistics in meta-analyses, but some trials use
		other summary statistics such as the median and quartiles to
		report the results. Therefore, researchers need to transform
		those information back to the sample mean and standard
		deviation. This package implemented sample mean estimators by
		Luo et al. (2016) arXiv:1505.05687, sample standard deviation
		estimators by Wan et al. (2014) arXiv:1407.8038, and the best
		linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) of location and scale
		parameters by Yang et al. (2018, submitted) based on sample
		quantiles derived summaries in a meta-analysis.
