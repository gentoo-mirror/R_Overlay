		Practical Item Response Theory and Computer-Based Testing in R //
		An implementation of item response theory (IRT) and computer-
		based testing in R. It is designed for bridging the gap between
		theoretical advancements in psychometric research and their
		applications in practice. Currently, it consists of five
		modules: (1) common IRT functions, (2) estimation procedures,
		(3) automated test assembly framework, (4) computerized
		adaptive testing framework, (5) multistage testing framework.
		See detailed documentation at
