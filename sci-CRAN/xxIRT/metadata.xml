		Practical Item Response Theory and Computer-Based Testing in R //
		An implementation of item response theory and computer-based
		testing in R. It is designed for bridging the gap between
		theoretical advancements in psychometric research and their
		applications in practice. Currently, it consists of five
		modules: (1) common item response theory functions, (2)
		estimation procedures, (3) automated test assembly framework,
		(4) computerized adaptive testing framework, (5) multistage
		testing framework. See detailed documentation at
		https://github.com/xluo11/xxIRT.
