		Easy Differential Privacy // An implementation of major general-
		purpose mechanisms for privatizing statistics, models, and
		machine learners, within the framework of differential privacy
		of Dwork et al. (2006) doi:10.1007/11681878_14. Example
		mechanisms include the Laplace mechanism for releasing numeric
		aggregates, and the exponential mechanism for releasing set
		elements. A sensitivity sampler (Rubinstein  Alda, 2017)
		arXiv:1706.02562 permits sampling target non-private function
		sensitivity; combined with the generic mechanisms, it permits
		turn-key privatization of arbitrary programs.
