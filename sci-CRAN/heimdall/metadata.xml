		Drift Adaptable Models // By analyzing streaming datasets, it is
		possible to observe significant changes in the data
		distribution or models' accuracy during their prediction
		(concept drift). The goal of 'heimdall' is to measure when
		concept drift occurs. The package makes available several
		state-of-the-art methods. It also tackles how to adapt models
		in a nonstationary context. Some concept drifts methods are
		described in Tavares (2022) doi:10.1007/s12530-021-09415-z.
