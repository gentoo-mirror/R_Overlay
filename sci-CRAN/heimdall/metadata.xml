		Drift Adaptable Models // In streaming data analysis, it is
		crucial to detect significant shifts in the data distribution
		or the accuracy of predictive models over time, a phenomenon
		known as concept drift. The package aims to identify when
		concept drift occurs and provide methodologies for adapting
		models in non-stationary environments. It offers a range of
		state-of-the-art techniques for detecting concept drift and
		maintaining model performance. Additionally, the package
		provides tools for adapting models in response to these
		changes, ensuring continuous and accurate predictions in
		dynamic contexts. Methods for concept drift detection are
		described in Tavares (2022) doi:10.1007/s12530-021-09415-z.
