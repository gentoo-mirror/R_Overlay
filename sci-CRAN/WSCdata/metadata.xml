		A New Four-Arm Within-Study Comparison Data on Math and
		Vocabulary Training // This dataset was collected using a new
		four-arm within-study comparison design. The study aimed to
		examine the impact of a mathematics training intervention and a
		vocabulary study session on post-test scores in mathematics and
		vocabulary, respectively. The innovative four-arm within-study
		comparison design facilitates both experimental and quasi-
		experimental identification of average causal effects.
