		The FPCdpca Criterion on Distributed Principal Component Analysis
		// We consider optimal subset selection in the setting that one
		needs to use only one data subset to represent the whole data
		set with minimum information loss, and devise a novel
		intersection-based criterion on selecting optimal subset,
		called as the FPC criterion, to handle with the optimal sub-
		estimator in distributed principal component analysis; That is,
		the FPCdpca. The philosophy of the package is described in Guo
