		Statistical Depth Functions for Multivariate Analysis // Data
		depth concept offers a variety of powerful and user friendly
		tools for robust exploration and inference for multivariate
		data. The offered techniques may be successfully used in cases
		of lack of our knowledge on parametric models generating data
		due to their nature. The package consist of among others
		implementations of several data depth techniques involving
		multivariate quantile-quantile plots, multivariate scatter
		estimators, multivariate Wilcoxon tests and robust regressions.
