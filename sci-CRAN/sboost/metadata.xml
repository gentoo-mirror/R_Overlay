		Machine Learning with AdaBoost on Decision Stumps // Creates
		classifier for binary outcomes using Adaptive Boosting
		(AdaBoost) algorithm on decision stumps with a fast C++
		implementation. For a description of AdaBoost, see Freund and
		Schapire (1997) doi:10.1006/jcss.1997.1504. This type of
		classifier is nonlinear, but easy to interpret and visualize.
		Feature vectors may be a combination of continuous (numeric)
		and categorical (string, factor) elements. Methods for
		classifier assessment, predictions, and cross-validation also
		included.
