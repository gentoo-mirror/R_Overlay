		Machine Learning with AdaBoost on Decision Stumps // Creates
		classifier for binary outcomes using Freund and Schapire's
		Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm on decision stumps with
		a fast C++ implementation. This type of classifier is
		nonlinear, but easy to interpret and visualize. Feature vectors
		may be a combination of continuous (numeric) and categorical
		(string, factor) elements. Methods for classifier assessment,
		predictions, and cross-validation also included.
