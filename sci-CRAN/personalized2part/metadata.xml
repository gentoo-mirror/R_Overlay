		Two-Part Estimation of Treatment Rules for Semi-Continuous Data
		// Implements the methodology of Huling, Smith, and Chen (2020)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1801449, which allows for subgroup
		identification for semi-continuous outcomes by estimating
		individualized treatment rules. It uses a two-part modeling
		framework to handle semi-continuous data by separately modeling
		the positive part of the outcome and an indicator of whether
		each outcome is positive, but still results in a single
		treatment rule. High dimensional data is handled with a
		cooperative lasso penalty, which encourages the coefficients in
		the two models to have the same sign.
