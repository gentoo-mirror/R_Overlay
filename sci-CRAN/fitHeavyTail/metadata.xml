		Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails // Robust
		estimation methods for the mean vector, scatter matrix, and
		covariance matrix (if it exists) from data (possibly containing
		NAs) under multivariate heavy-tailed distributions such as
		angular Gaussian (via Tyler's method), Cauchy, and Student's t
		distributions. Additionally, a factor model structure can be
		specified for the covariance matrix. The latest revision also
		includes the multivariate skewed t distribution. The package is
		based on the papers: Sun, Babu, and Palomar (2014); Sun, Babu,
		and Palomar (2015); Liu and Rubin (1995); Zhou, Liu, Kumar, and
		Palomar (2019); Pascal, Ollila, and Palomar (2021).
