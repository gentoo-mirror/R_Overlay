		AI Screening Tools in R for Systematic Reviewing // Provides
		functions to conduct title and abstract screening in systematic
		reviews using large language models, such as the Generative
		Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models from 'OpenAI'
		https://platform.openai.com/. These functions can enhance the
		quality of title and abstract screenings while reducing the
		total screening time significantly. In addition, the package
		includes tools for quality assessment of title and abstract
		screenings, as described in Vembye, Christensen, Mlgaard, and
		Schytt (2024) DOI:10.31219/osf.io/yrhzm.
