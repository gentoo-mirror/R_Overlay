		Visualisation and Annotation of 360 Degree Imagery // Provides a
		customisable R 'shiny' app for immersively visualising, mapping
		and annotating panospheric (360 degree) imagery. The flexible
		interface allows annotation of any geocoded images using up to
		4 user specified dropdown menus. The app uses 'leaflet' to
		render maps that display the geo-locations of images and
		panellum https://pannellum.org/, a lightweight panorama viewer
		for the web, to render images in virtual 360 degree viewing
		mode. Key functions include the ability to draw on  export
		parts of 360 images for downstream applications. Users can also
		draw polygons and points on map imagery related to the
		panoramic images and export them for further analysis.
		Downstream applications include using annotations to train
		Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) models and
		geospatial modelling and analysis of camera based survey data.
