		Iterative Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction
		Terms for Feature Selection // Based on large margin principle,
		this package performs feature selection methods:
		"IM4E"(Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy
		Algorithm); "imIM4E"(imbalance Iterative Margin-Maximization
		under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); "Immigrate"(Iterative Max-Min
		Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction Terms Algorithm);
		"BIM"(Boosted version of IMMIGRATE algorithm);
		"Simba"(Iterative Search Margin Based Algorithm); "LFE"(Local
		Feature Extraction Algorithm). This package also performs
		prediction for the above feature selection methods. See Zhao et
		al. (2018) arXiv:1810.02658 for more details.
