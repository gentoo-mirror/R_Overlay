		Phase Plane Analysis of One and Two Dimensional Autonomous ODE
		Systems // Performs a qualitative analysis of one and two
		dimensional autonomous ODE systems, using phase plane methods.
		Programs are available to identify and classify equilibrium
		points, plot the direction field, and plot trajectories for
		multiple initial conditions. In the one dimensional case, a
		program is also available to plot the phase portrait. Whilst in
		the two dimensional case, programs are additionally available
		to plot nullclines and stable/unstable manifolds of saddle
		points. Many example systems are provided for the user.
