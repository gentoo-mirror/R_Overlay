		Filter Noisy Data // Noise filter based on determining the
		proportion of neighboring points. A false point will be
		rejected if it has only few neighbors, but accepted if the
		proportion of neighbors in a rectangular frame is high. The
		size of the rectangular frame as well as the cut-off value,
		i.e. of a minimum proportion of neighbor-points, may be
		supplied or can be calculated automatically. Originally
		designed for the cleaning of heart rates, but suitable for
		filtering any slowly-changing physiological variable.For more
		information see Signer (2010)doi:
