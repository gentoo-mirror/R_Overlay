		Fit High-Dimensional Proportional Hazards Models // Variable
		selection in a high dimensional setting is becoming a task of
		key importance, particularly in the biomedical sciences where
		data is often high-dimensional. This package implements
		methodology designed to performs variable selection in a high-
		dimensional settings, whilst also providing mechanisms for
		uncertainty quantification and effect estimations. Broadly, we
		use a spike-and-slab prior with Laplace slab and Dirac spike
		and seek to approximate the corresponding posterior using
		variational inference. Our variational approximation thereby
		provides posterior inclusion probabilities, point estimates for
		the effect sizes and uncertainty quantification for the effect
		sizes.
