		Fit High-Dimensional Proportional Hazards Models //
		Implementation of methodology designed to perform: (i) variable
		selection, (ii) effect estimation, and (iii) uncertainty
		quantification, for high-dimensional survival data. Our method
		uses a spike-and-slab prior with Laplace slab and Dirac spike
		and approximates the corresponding posterior using variational
		inference, a popular method in machine learning for scalable
		conditional inference. Although approximate, the variational
		posterior provides excellent point estimates and good control
		of the false discovery rate. For more information see
		Komodromos et al. (2021) arXiv:2112.10270.
