		'ICD' Programs for Injury Categorization in R // Categorization
		and scoring of injury severity typically involves trained
		personnel with access to injured persons or their medical
		records. 'icdpicr' contains a function that provides automated
		calculation of Abbreviated Injury Scale ('AIS') and Injury
		Severity Score ('ISS') from International Classification of
		Diseases ('ICD') codes and may be a useful substitute to manual
		injury severity scoring. 'ICDPIC' was originally developed in
		'Stata', and 'icdpicr' is an open-access update that accepts
		both 'ICD-9' and 'ICD-10' codes.
