		Fast Sparse Wrapper Algorithm for Generalized Linear Models and
		Testing Procedures for Network of Highly Predictive Variables
		// Provides a fast implementation of the SWAG algorithm for
		Generalized Linear Models which allows to perform a meta-
		learning procedure that combines screening and wrapper methods
		to find a set of extremely low-dimensional attribute
		combinations. The package then performs test on the network of
		selected models to identify the variables that are highly
		predictive by using entropy-based network measures.
