		Hidden Markov Models with Extra Zeros // Contains functions for
		hidden Markov models with observations having extra zeros as
		defined in the following two publications, Wang, T., Zhuang,
		J., Obara, K. and Tsuruoka, H. (2016) doi:10.1111/rssc.12194;
		Wang, T., Zhuang, J., Buckby, J., Obara, K. and Tsuruoka, H.
		(2018) doi:10.1029/2017JB015360. The observed response variable
		is either univariate or bivariate Gaussian conditioning on
		presence of events, and extra zeros mean that the response
		variable takes on the value zero if nothing is happening. Hence
		the response is modelled as a mixture distribution of a
		Bernoulli variable and a continuous variable. That is, if the
		Bernoulli variable takes on the value 1, then the response
		variable is Gaussian, and if the Bernoulli variable takes on
		the value 0, then the response is zero too. This package
		includes functions for simulation, parameter estimation,
		goodness-of-fit, the Viterbi algorithm, and plotting the
		classified 2-D data. Some of the functions in the package are
		based on those of the R package 'HiddenMarkov' by David Harte.
		This updated version has included an example dataset and R code
		examples to show how to transform the data into the objects
		needed in the main functions. We have also made changes to
		increase the speed of some of the functions.
