		EM Algorithm for Maximum Likelihood Estimation by Non-Precise
		Information // The EM algorithm is a powerful tool for
		computing maximum likelihood estimates with incomplete data.
		This package will help to applying EM algorithm based on
		triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (as two kinds of
		incomplete data). A method is proposed for estimating the
		unknown parameter in a parametric statistical model when the
		observations are triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. This
		method is based on maximizing the observed-data likelihood
		defined as the conditional probability of the fuzzy data; for
		more details and formulas see Denoeux (2011)
