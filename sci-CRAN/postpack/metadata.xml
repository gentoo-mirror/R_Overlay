		Utilities for Processing Posterior Samples Stored in 'mcmc.lists'
		// The aim of 'postpack' is to provide the infrastructure for a
		standardized workflow for 'mcmc.list' objects. These objects
		can be used to store output from models fitted with Bayesian
		inference using 'JAGS', 'WinBUGS', 'OpenBUGS', 'NIMBLE',
		'Stan', or even custom MCMC algorithms. Although the 'coda' R
		package provides some methods for these objects, it is somewhat
		limited in easily performing post-processing tasks for specific
		nodes. Models are ever increasing in their complexity and the
		number of tracked nodes, and oftentimes a user may wish to
		summarize/diagnose sampling behavior for only a small subset of
		nodes at a time for a particular question or figure. Thus, many
		'postpack' functions support performing tasks on a subset of
		nodes, where the subset is specified with regular expressions.
		The functions in 'postpack' streamline the extraction,
		summarization, and diagnostics of specific monitored nodes
		after model fitting. Further, because there is rarely only ever
		one model under consideration, 'postpack' scales efficiently to
		perform the same tasks on output from multiple models
		simultaneously, facilitating rapid assessment of model
		sensitivity to changes in assumptions.
