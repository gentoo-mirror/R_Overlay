		Bayes Factors, Model Choice and Variable Selection in Linear
		Models // Conceived to calculate Bayes factors in linear models
		and then to provide a formal Bayesian answer to testing and
		variable selection problems. From a theoretical side, the
		emphasis in this package is placed on the prior distributions
		and it allows a wide range of them: Jeffreys (1961); Zellner
		and Siow(1980)DOI:10.1007/bf02888369; Zellner and Siow(1984);
		Zellner (1986)DOI:10.2307/2233941; Fernandez et al.
		(2001)DOI:10.1016/s0304-4076(00)00076-2; Liang et al.
		(2008)DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337  and Bayarri et al.
		(2012)DOI:10.1214/12-aos1013. The interaction with the package
		is through a friendly interface that syntactically mimics the
		well-known lm() command of R. The resulting objects can be
		easily explored providing the user very valuable information
		(like marginal, joint and conditional inclusion probabilities
		of potential variables; the highest posterior probability
		model, HPM; the median probability model, MPM) about the
		structure of the true -data generating- model. Additionally,
		this package incorporates abilities to handle problems with a
		large number of potential explanatory variables through
		parallel and heuristic versions of the main commands, Garcia-
		Donato and Martinez-Beneito
