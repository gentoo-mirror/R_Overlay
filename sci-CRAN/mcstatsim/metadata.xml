		Monte Carlo Statistical Simulation Tools Using a Functional
		Approach // A lightweight package designed to facilitate
		statistical simulations through functional programming. It
		centralizes the simulation process into a single higher-order
		function, enhancing manageability and usability without adding
		overhead from external dependencies. The package includes
		ready-to-use functions for common simulation targets. A
		detailed example can be found on
		https://github.com/ielbadisy/mcstatsim.
