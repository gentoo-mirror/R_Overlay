		Create ToxPi Prioritization Models // Enables users to build
		'ToxPi' prioritization models and provides functionality within
		the grid framework for plotting ToxPi graphs. 'toxpiR' allows
		for more customization than the 'ToxPi GUI' (https://toxpi.org)
		and integration into existing workflows for greater ease-of-
		use, reproducibility, and transparency. toxpiR package behaves
		nearly identically to the GUI; the package documentation
		includes notes about all differences. The vignettes download
		example files from https://github.com/ToxPi/ToxPi-example-
		files.
