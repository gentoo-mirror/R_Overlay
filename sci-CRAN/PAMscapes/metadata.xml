		Tools for Summarising and Analysing Soundscape Data // A variety
		of tools relevant to the analysis of marine soundscape data.
		There are tools for downloading AIS (automatic identification
		system) data from Marine Cadastre
		https://marinecadastre.gov/ais/, connecting AIS data to GPS
		coordinates, plotting summaries of various soundscape
		measurements, and downloading relevant environmental variables
		(wind, swell height) from the National Center for Atmospheric
		Research data server https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/.
		Most tools were developed to work well with output from
		'Triton' software, but can be adapted to work with any similar
		measurements.
