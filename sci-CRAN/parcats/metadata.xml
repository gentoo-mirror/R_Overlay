		Interactive Parallel Categories Diagrams for 'easyalluvial' //
		Complex graphical representations of data are best explored
		using interactive elements. 'parcats' adds interactive graphing
		capabilities to the 'easyalluvial' package. The 'plotly.js'
		parallel categories diagrams offer a good framework for
		creating interactive flow graphs that allow manual drag and
		drop sorting of dimensions and categories, highlighting single
		flows and displaying mouse over information. The 'plotly.js'
		dependency is quite heavy and therefore is outsourced into a
		separate package.
