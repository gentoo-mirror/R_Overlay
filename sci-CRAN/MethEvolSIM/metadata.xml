		Simulate DNA Methylation Dynamics on Different Genomic Structures
		along Genealogies // DNA methylation is an epigenetic
		modification involved in genomic stability, gene regulation,
		development and disease. DNA methylation occurs mainly through
		the addition of a methyl group to cytosines, for example to
		cytosines in a CpG dinucleotide context (CpG stands for a
		cytosine followed by a guanine). Tissue-specific methylation
		patterns lead to genomic regions with different characteristic
		methylation levels. E.g. in vertebrates CpG islands (regions
		with high CpG content) that are associated to promoter regions
		of expressed genes tend to be unmethylated. 'MethEvolSIM' is a
		model-based simulation software for the generation and
		modification of cytosine methylation patterns along a given
		tree, which can be a genealogy of cells within an organism, a
		coalescent tree of DNA sequences sampled from a population, or
		a species tree. The simulations are based on an extension of
		the model of Grosser  Metzler (2020)
		doi:10.1186/s12859-020-3438-5 and allows for changes of the
		methylation states at single cytosine positions as well as
		simultaneous changes of methylation frequencies in genomic
		structures like CpG islands.
