		Fast Two Stage Multiple Change Point Detection // A novel and
		fast two stage method for simultaneous multiple change point
		detection and variable selection for piecewise stationary
		autoregressive (PSAR) processes and linear regression model. It
		also simultaneously performs variable selection for each
		autoregressive model and hence the order selection.
