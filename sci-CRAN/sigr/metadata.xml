		Succinctly and correctly format statistical summaries of
		various models and tests (F-test, Chi-Sq-test, Fisher-test,
		T-test, and rank-significance).  The main purpose is unified
		reporting of experimental results, working around issue such as
		the difficulty of extracting model summary facts (such as with
		'lm'/'glm').  This package also includes empirical tests, such
		as bootstrap estimates.
