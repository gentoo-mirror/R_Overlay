		Tracking the Progress of Mc*pply with Progress Bar // A light-
		weight package helps you track and visualize the progress of
		parallel version of vectorized R functions (mc*apply).
		Parallelization (mc.core  1) works only on *nix (Linux, Unix
		such as macOS) system due to the lack of fork() functionality,
		which is essential for mc*apply, on Windows.
