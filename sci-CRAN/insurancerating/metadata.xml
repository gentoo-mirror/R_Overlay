		Analytic Insurance Rating Techniques // Methods for insurance
		rating. It provides a data driven strategy for the construction
		of insurance tariff classes. This strategy is based on the work
		by Antonio and Valdez (2012) doi:10.1007/s10182-011-0152-7. The
		package also adds functionality showing additional lines for
		the reference categories in the levels of the coefficients in
		the output of a generalized linear regression analysis. In
		addition it implements a procedure determining the level of a
		factor with the largest exposure, and thereafter changing the
		base level of the factor to this level.
