		Analytic Insurance Rating Techniques // Methods for insurance
		rating. It provides a data driven strategy for the construction
		of insurance tariff classes. This strategy is based on the work
		by Antonio and Valdez (2012) doi:10.1007/s10182-011-0152-7.
		insurancerating also provides recipes on how to easily perform
		univariate analyses on an insurance portfolio. In addition it
		adds functionality to include reference categories in the
		levels of the coefficients in the output of a generalized
		linear regression analysis.
