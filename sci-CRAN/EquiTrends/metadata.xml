		Equivalence Testing for Pre-Trends in Difference-in-Differences
		Designs // Testing for parallel trends is crucial in the
		Difference-in-Differences framework. To this end, this package
		performs equivalence testing in the context of Difference-in-
		Differences estimation. It allows users to test if pre-
		treatment trends in the treated group are equivalent to those
		in the control group. Here, equivalence means that rejection of
		the null hypothesis implies that a function of the pre-
		treatment placebo effects (maximum absolute, average or root
		mean squared value) does not exceed a pre-specified threshold
		below which trend differences are considered negligible. The
		package is based on the theory developed in Dette  Schumann
