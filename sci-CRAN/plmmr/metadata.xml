		Penalized Linear Mixed Models for Correlated Data // Fits
		penalized linear mixed models that correct for unobserved
		confounding factors. 'plmmr' infers and corrects for the
		presence of unobserved confounding effects such as population
		stratification and environmental heterogeneity. It then fits a
		linear model via penalized maximum likelihood. Originally
		designed for the multivariate analysis of single nucleotide
		polymorphisms (SNPs) measured in a genome-wide association
		study (GWAS), 'plmmr' eliminates the need for subpopulation-
		specific analyses and post-analysis p-value adjustments.
		Functions for the appropriate processing of 'PLINK' files are
		also supplied. For examples, see the package homepage.
