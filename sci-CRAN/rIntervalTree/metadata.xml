		An Interval Tree Tool for Real Numbers // This tool can be used
		to build binary interval trees using real number inputs. The
		tree supports queries of intervals overlapping a single number
		or an interval (start, end). Intervals with same bounds but
		different names are treated as distinct intervals. Insertion of
		intervals is also allowed. Deletion of intervals is not
		implemented at this point. See  Mark de Berg, Otfried Cheong,
		Marc van Kreveld, Mark Overmars (2008). Computational Geometry:
		Algorithms and Applications, for a reference.
