		Small Area Estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian Method for Rao
		Yu Model // We designed this package to provide several
		functions for area level of small area estimation using
		hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method. This package provides model
		using panel data for variable interest.This package also
		provides a dataset produced by a data generation. The 'rjags'
		package is employed to obtain parameter estimates. Model-based
		estimators involves the HB estimators which include the mean
		and the variation of mean. For the reference, see Rao and
		Molina (2015).
