		'hms' Based Timer // Tracks elapsed clock time using a
		`hms::hms()` scalar, which if running has an attribute named
		start that specifies the system time when the timer was
		started.  The elapsed time is the value of the scalar plus the
		difference between the current system time and the system time
		when the timer was started.
