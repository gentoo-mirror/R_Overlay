		Joint Dimension Reduction and Spatial Clustering // Joint
		dimension reduction and spatial clustering is conducted for
		Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data,
		and more details can be referred to Yi Yang, Xingjie Shi, Wei
		Liu et al. (2021) doi:10.1101/2021.06.05.447181. It is not only
		computationally efficient and scalable to the sample size
		increment, but also is capable of choosing the smoothness
		parameter and the number of clusters as well.
