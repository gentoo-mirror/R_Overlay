		Joint Dimension Reduction and Spatial Clustering // Joint
		dimension reduction and spatial clustering is conducted for
		Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data,
		and more details can be referred to Wei Liu, Xu Liao, Xiang
		Zhou, Shijie Shi and Jin Liu. (2021)
		doi:10.1101/2021.12.25.474153. It is not only computationally
		efficient and scalable to the sample size increment, but also
		is capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number
		of clusters as well.
