		Signature Survival Analysis // When multiple Cox proportional
		hazard models are performed on clinical data (month or year and
		status) and a set of differential expressions of genes, the
		results (Hazard risks, z-scores and p-values) can be used to
		create gene-expression signatures. Weights are calculated using
		the survival p-values of genes and are utilized to calculate
		expression values of the signature across the selected genes in
		all patients in a cohort. A Single or multiple univariate or
		multivariate Cox proportional hazard survival analyses of the
		patients in one cohort can be performed by using the gene-
		expression signature and visualized using our survival plots.
