		Epidemic Volatility Index as an Early-Warning Tool // This is an
		R package implementing the epidemic volatility index (EVI), as
		discussed by Kostoulas et. al. (2021) and variations by Pateras
		et. al. (2023). EVI is a new, conceptually simple, early
		warning tool for oncoming epidemic waves. EVI is based on the
		volatility of newly reported cases per unit of time, ideally
		per day, and issues an early warning when the volatility change
		rate exceeds a threshold.
