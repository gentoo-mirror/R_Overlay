		Electoral Analysis // Functions to obtain an important number of
		electoral indicators described in the package, which can be
		divided into two large sections: The first would be the one
		containing the indicators of electoral disproportionality, such
		as, Rae index, LoosemoreHanby index, etc. The second group is
		intended to study the dimensions of the party system vote,
		through the indicators of electoral fragmentation,
		polarization, volatility, etc. Moreover, multiple seat
		allocation simulations can also be performed based on different
		allocation systems, such as the D'Hondt method, Sainte-Lagu,
		etc. Finally, some of these functions have been built so that,
		if the user wishes, the data provided by the Spanish Ministry
		of Home Office for different electoral processes held in Spain
		can be obtained automatically. All the above will allow the
		users to carry out deep studies on the results obtained in any
		type of electoral process. The methods are described in: Oate,
		Pablo and Ocaa, Francisco A. (1999, ISBN:9788474762815); Ruiz
		Rodrguez, Leticia M. and Otero Felipe, Patricia (2011,
		ISBN:9788474766226).
