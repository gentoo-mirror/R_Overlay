		Reliable Plying of Remote or Big Data with R // Methods to use
		'dplyr' remote data sources ('SQL' databases, 'Spark' 2.0.0 and
		above) in a reliable "generic" fashion (generic meaning user
		code works similarly on all such sources, without needing per-
		source adaption). Adds convenience functions to make such tasks
		more like working with an in-memory R 'data.frame'.
