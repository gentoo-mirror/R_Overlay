		Multiple Imputation using Chained Random Forests // Functions for
		methods for multiple imputation using chained random forests.
		Implemented algorithms can handle missing data in both
		continuous and categorical variables by using prediction-based
		or node-based conditional distributions constructed using
		random forests. For prediction-based imputation, the method
		based on the empirical distribution of out-of-bag prediction
		errors of random forests and the method based on normality
		assumption are provided. For node-based imputation, the method
		based on the conditional distribution formed by predicting
		nodes of random forests and the method based on measures of
		proximities of random forests are provided. More details of the
		statistical methods can be found in Hong et al. (2020)
		arXiv:2004.14823.
