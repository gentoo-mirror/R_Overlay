		Multiple Imputation using Chained Random Forests // An R package
		for methods of multiple imputation using chained random
		forests. Implemented methods can handle missing data in mixed
		types of by using prediction-based or node-based conditional
		distributions constructed using random forests. For prediction-
		based imputation, the method based on the empirical
		distribution of out-of-bag prediction errors of random forests,
		and the method based on normality assumption are provided for
		continuous variables. And the method based on predicted
		probabilities is provided for categorical variables. For node-
		based imputation, the method based on the conditional
		distribution formed by the predicting nodes of random forests,
		and the method based on proximity measures of random forests
		are provided. More details of the statistical methods can be
		found in Hong et al. (2020) arXiv:2004.14823.
