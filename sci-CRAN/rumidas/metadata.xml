		Univariate GARCH-MIDAS, Double-Asymmetric GARCH-MIDAS and MEM-
		MIDAS // Adds the MIxing-Data Sampling (MIDAS, Ghysels et al.
		(2007) doi:10.1080/07474930600972467) components to a variety
		of GARCH and MEM (Engle (2002) doi:10.1002/jae.683) models,
		with the aim of predicting the volatility with additional low-
		frequency (that is, MIDAS) terms. The estimation takes place
		through simple functions, which provide in-sample and (if
		present) and out-of-sample evaluations. 'rumidas' also offers a
		summary tool, which synthesizes the main information of the
		estimated model. There is also the possibility of generating
		one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasts.
