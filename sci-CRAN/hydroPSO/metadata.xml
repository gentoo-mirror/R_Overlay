		Particle Swarm Optimisation, with focus on Environmental Models
		// This package implements a state-of-the-art version of the
		Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm (SPSO-2011 and
		SPSO-2007 capable). hydroPSO can be used as a replacement of
		the 'optim' R function for (global) optimization of non-smooth
		and non-linear functions. However, the main focus of hydroPSO
		is the calibration of environmental and other real-world models
		that need to be executed from the system console. hydroPSO is
		model-independent, allowing the user to easily interface any
		computer simulation model with the calibration engine (PSO).
		hydroPSO  communicates with the model through the model's own
		input and output files, without requiring access to the model's
		source code. Several PSO variants and controlling options are
		included to fine-tune the performance of the calibration engine
		to different calibration problems. An advanced sensitivity
		analysis function together with user-friendly plotting
		summaries facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the
		calibration results. hydroPSO is parallel-capable, to alleviate
		the computational burden of complex models with "long"
		execution time. Bugs reports/comments/questions are very
		welcomed (in English, Spanish or Italian).
