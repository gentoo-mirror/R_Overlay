		Particle Swarm Optimisation, with Focus on Environmental Models
		// State-of-the-art version of the Particle Swarm Optimisation
		(PSO) algorithm (SPSO-2011 and SPSO-2007 capable). hydroPSO can
		be used as a replacement of the 'optim' R function for (global)
		optimization of non-smooth and non-linear functions. However,
		the main focus of hydroPSO is the calibration of environmental
		and other real-world models that need to be executed from the
		system console. hydroPSO is model-independent, allowing the
		user to easily interface any computer simulation model with the
		calibration engine (PSO). hydroPSO  communicates with the model
		through the model's own input and output files, without
		requiring access to the model's source code. Several PSO
		variants and controlling options are included to fine-tune the
		performance of the calibration engine to different calibration
		problems. An advanced sensitivity analysis function together
		with user-friendly plotting summaries facilitate the
		interpretation and assessment of the calibration results.
		hydroPSO is parallel-capable, to alleviate the computational
		burden of complex models with "long" execution time. Bugs
		reports/comments/questions are very welcomed (in English,
		Spanish or Italian). See Zambrano-Bigiarini and Rojas (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.01.004 for more details.
