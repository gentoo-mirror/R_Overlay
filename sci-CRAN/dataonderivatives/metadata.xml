		Easily Source Publicly Available Data on Derivatives // Post
		Global Financial Crisis derivatives reforms have lifted the
		veil off over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets. Swap
		Execution Facilities (SEFs) and Swap Data Repositories (SDRs)
		now publish data on swaps that are traded on or reported to
		those facilities (respectively). This package provides you the
		ability to get this data from supported sources.
