		Easily Source Publicly Available Data on Derivatives // Post-GFC
		derivatives reforms have lifted the veil off over-the-counter
		(OTC) derivative markets. Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs) and
		Swap Data Repositories (SDRs) now publish data on swaps that
		are traded on or reported to those facilities (respectively).
		This package provides you the ability to get this data from
		supported sources.
