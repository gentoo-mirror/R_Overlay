		Thermoluminescence Glow Curve Deconvolution // Deconvolving
		thermoluminescence glow curves according to various kinetic
		models (first-order, second-order, general-order, and mixed-
		order) using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. It
		provides the possibility of setting constraints or fixing any
		of parameters. It offers an interactive way to initialize
		parameters by clicking with a mouse on a plot at positions
		where peak maxima should be located. The optimal estimate is
		obtained by "trial-and-error". It also provides routines for
		simulating first-order, second-order, and general-order glow
		peaks.
