		Prediction Explanation with Dependence-Aware Shapley Values //
		Complex machine learning models are often hard to interpret.
		However, in many situations it is crucial to understand and
		explain why a model made a specific prediction. Shapley values
		is the only method for such prediction explanation framework
		with a solid theoretical foundation. Previously known methods
		for estimating the Shapley values do, however, assume feature
		independence. This package implements the method described in
		Aas, Jullum and Lland (2019) arXiv:1903.10464, which accounts
		for any feature dependence, and thereby produces more accurate
		estimates of the true Shapley values.
