		Rigorous Data Reduction and Error Propagation of Ar40 / Ar39 Data
		// Processes noble gas mass spectrometer data to determine the
		isotopic composition of argon (comprised of Ar36, Ar37, Ar38,
		Ar39 and Ar40) released from neutron-irradiated potassium-
		bearing minerals. Then uses these compositions to calculate
		precise and accurate geochronological ages for multiple samples
		as well as the covariances between them. Error propagation is
		done in matrix form, which jointly treats all samples and all
		isotopes simultaneously at every step of the data reduction
		process. Includes methods for regression of the time-resolved
		mass spectrometer signals to t=0 ('time zero') for both single-
		and multi-collector instruments, blank correction, mass
		fractionation correction, detector intercalibration, decay
		corrections, interference corrections, interpolation of the
		irradiation parameter between neutron fluence monitors, and
		(weighted mean) age calculation. All operations are performed
		on the logs of the ratios between the different argon isotopes
		so as to properly treat them as 'compositional data', sensu
		Aitchison [1986, The Statistics of Compositional Data, Chapman
		and Hall].
