		Survival Distributions with Piece-Wise Constant Hazards //
		Density, distribution function, ... hazard function, cumulative
		hazard function, survival function for survival distributions
		with piece-wise constant hazards and multiple states and
		methods to plot and summarise those distributions. A derivation
		of the used algorithms can be found in my masters thesis
