		Process Metadata from the 'Open Graph Protocol' // Social media
		sites often embed cards when links are shared, based on
		metadata in the 'Open Graph Protocol' (https://ogp.me/). This
		supports extracting that metadata from a website. It further
		allows for the creation of tags to add to a website to support
		the 'Open Graph Protocol' and provides a list of the standard
		tags and their required properties.
