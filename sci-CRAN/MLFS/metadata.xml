		Machine Learning Forest Simulator // Climate-sensitive forest
		simulator based on the principles of machine learning. It
		stimulates all key processes in the forest: radial growth,
		height growth, mortality, crown recession, regeneration and
		harvesting. The method for predicting tree heights was
		described by Skudnik and Jevenak (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120017, while the method for
		predicting basal area increments (BAI) was described by Jevenak
		and Skudnik (2021) doi:10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118601.
