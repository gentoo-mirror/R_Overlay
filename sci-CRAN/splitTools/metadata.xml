		Tools for Data Splitting // Fast, lightweight toolkit for data
		splitting. Data sets can be partitioned into disjoint groups
		(e.g. into training, validation, and test) or into (repeated)
		k-folds for subsequent cross-validation. Besides basic splits,
		the package supports stratified, grouped as well as blocked
		splitting. Furthermore, cross-validation folds for time series
		data can be created. See e.g. Hastie et al. (2001)
		doi:10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7 for the basic background on data
		partitioning and cross-validation.
