		Standardized Climate Indices Such as SPI, SRI or SPEI //
		Functions for generating Standardized Climate Indices (SCI).
		SCI is a transformation of (smoothed) climate (or
		environmental) time series that  removes seasonality and forces
		the data to take values of the standard normal distribution.
		SCI was originally developed for precipitation. In this case it
		is known as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).
