		Data Pre-Processing for Bacterial Genome-Wide Association Studies
		// Standardize the pre-processing of genomic variants before
		performing a bacterial genome-wide association study (bGWAS).
		'prewas' creates a variant matrix (where each row is a variant,
		each column is a sample, and the entries are presence - 1 - or
		absence - 0 - of the variant) that can be used as input for
		bGWAS tools. When creating the binary variant matrix, 'prewas'
		can perform 3 pre-processing steps including: dealing with
		multiallelic SNPs, (optional) dealing with SNPs in overlapping
		genes, and choosing a reference allele. 'prewas' can output
		matrices for use with both SNP-based bGWAS and gene-based
		bGWAS. This method is described in Saund et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000368. 'prewas' can also provide gene
		matrices for variants with specific annotations from the
		'SnpEff' software (Cingolani et al. 2012).
