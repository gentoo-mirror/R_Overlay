		Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of North American BBS Data // The
		North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a long-running
		program that seeks to monitor the status and trends of the
		breeding birds in North America. Since its start in 1966, the
		BBS has accumulated over 50 years of data for over 500 species
		of North American Birds. Given the temporal and spatial
		structure of the data, hierarchical Bayesian models are used to
		assess the status and trends of these 500+ species of birds.
		'bbsBayes' allows you to perform hierarchical Bayesian analysis
		of BBS data. You can run a full model analysis for one or more
		species that you choose, or you can take more control and
		specify how the data should be stratified, prepared for 'JAGS',
		or modelled. The functions provided here allow you to replicate
		analyses performed by the United State Geological Survey (USGS,
		see Link and Sauer (2011) doi:10.1525/auk.2010.09220) and
		Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS, see Smith and Edwards (2020)
		doi:10.1101/2020.03.26.010215).
