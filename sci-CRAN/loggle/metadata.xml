		Local Group Graphical Lasso Estimation // Provides a set of
		methods that learn time-varying graphical models based on data
		measured over a temporal grid. The underlying statistical model
		is motivated by the needs to describe and understand evolving
		interacting relationships among a set of random variables in
		many real applications, for instance the study of how stocks
		interact with each other and how such interactions change over
		time. The time-varying graphical models are estimated under the
		assumption that the graph topology changes gradually over time.
		For more details on estimating time-varying graphical models,
		please refer to: Yang, J.  Peng, J. (2018) arXiv:1804.03811.
