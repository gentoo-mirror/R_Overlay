		One Sector Armington-CES Gravity Model with General Equilibrium
		// Implements a one-sector Armington-CES gravity model with
		general equilibrium (GE) effects. This model is designed to
		analyze international and domestic trade by capturing the
		impacts of trade costs and policy changes within a general
		equilibrium framework. Additionally, it includes a local
		parameter to run simulations on productivity. The package
		provides functions for calibration, simulation, and analysis of
		the model.
