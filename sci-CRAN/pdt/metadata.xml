		Permutation Distancing Test // Permutation (randomisation) test
		for single-case phase design data with two phases (e.g., pre-
		and post-treatment). Correction for dependency of observations
		is done through stepwise resampling the time series while
		varying the distance between observations. The required
		distance 0,1,2,3.. is determined based on repeated dependency
		testing while stepwise increasing the distance. In preparation:
		Vroegindeweij et al. "A Permutation distancing test for single-
		case observational AB phase design data: A Monte Carlo
		simulation study".
