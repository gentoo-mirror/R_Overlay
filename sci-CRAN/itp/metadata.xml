		The Interpolate, Truncate, Project (ITP) Root-Finding Algorithm
		// Implements the Interpolate, Truncate, Project (ITP) root-
		finding algorithm developed by Oliveira and Takahashi (2021)
		doi:10.1145/3423597. The user provides the function, from the
		real numbers to the real numbers, and an interval with the
		property that the values of the function at its endpoints have
		different signs. If the function is continuous over this
		interval then the ITP method estimates the value at which the
		function is equal to zero. If the function is discontinuous
		then a point of discontinuity at which the function changes
		sign may be found. The function can be supplied using either an
		R function or an external pointer to a C++ function. Tuning
		parameters of the ITP algorithm can be set by the user. Default
		values are set based on arguments in Oliveira and Takahashi
		(2021).
