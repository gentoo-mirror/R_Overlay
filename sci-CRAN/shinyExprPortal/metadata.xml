		A Configurable 'shiny' Portal for Sharing Analysis of Molecular
		Expression Data // Enables deploying configuration file-based
		'shiny' apps with minimal programming for interactive
		exploration and analysis showcase of molecular expression data.
		For exploration, supports visualization of correlations between
		rows of an expression matrix and a table of observations, such
		as clinical measures, and comparison of changes in expression
		over time. For showcase, enables visualizing the results of
		differential expression from package such as 'limma', co-
		expression modules from 'WGCNA' and lower dimensional
		projections.
