		Fundamental Clustering Problems Suite // Many conventional
		Clustering Algorithms are provided in this package with
		consistent input and output, which enables the user to tryout
		algorithms swiftly. Additionally, 26 statistical approaches for
		the estimation of the number of clusters as well as the the
		mirrored density plot (MD-plot) of clusterability are provided.
		Moreover, the fundamental clustering problems suite (FCPS)
		offers a variety of clustering challenges any algorithm should
		handle when facing real world data. Nine of the here presented
		artificial datasets were named FCPS in Ultsch, A.: "Clustering
		with SOM: U*C", In Workshop on Self-Organizing Maps, 2005.
