		Fundamental Clustering Problems Suite // Many conventional
		clustering algorithms are provided in this package with
		consistent input and output, which enables the user to try out
		algorithms swiftly. Additionally, 26 statistical approaches for
		the estimation of the number of clusters as well as the the
		mirrored density plot (MD-plot) of clusterability are
		implemented. The packages is published in Thrun, M.C., Stier
		Q.: "Fundamental Clustering Algorithms Suite" (2021),
		SoftwareX, DOI:10.1016/j.softx.2020.100642. Moreover, the
		fundamental clustering problems suite (FCPS) offers a variety
		of clustering challenges any algorithm should handle when
		facing real world data, see Thrun, M.C., Ultsch A.: "Clustering
		Benchmark Datasets Exploiting the Fundamental Clustering
		Problems" (2020), Data in Brief, DOI:10.1016/j.dib.2020.105501.
