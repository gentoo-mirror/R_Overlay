		Fundamental Clustering Problems Suite // Many conventional
		Clustering Algorithms are provided in this package with
		consistent input and output, which enables the user to tryout
		algorithms swiftly. Moreover, the fundamental clustering
		problems suite (FCPS) offers a variety of clustering challenges
		any algorithm should handle when facing real world data. The
		datasets were introduced in Ultsch, A.: "Clustering with SOM:
		U*C", In Workshop on Self-Organizing Maps, 2005.
