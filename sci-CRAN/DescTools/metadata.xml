		Tools for Descriptive Statistics // A collection of miscellaneous
		basic statistic functions and convenience wrappers for
		efficiently describing data. The author's intention was to
		create a toolbox, which facilitates the (notoriously time
		consuming) first descriptive tasks in data analysis, consisting
		of calculating descriptive statistics, drawing graphical
		summaries and reporting the results. The package contains
		furthermore functions to produce documents using MS Word (or
		PowerPoint) and functions to import data from Excel. Many of
		the included functions can be found scattered in other packages
		and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for
		collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated
		in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might
		depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to
		provide a common and consistent interface as far as function
		and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are
		concerned. Google style guides were used as naming rules (in
		absence of convincing alternatives). The 'BigCamelCase' style
		was consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed
		R packages as well.
