		Model-Free Reinforcement Learning // Performs model-free
		reinforcement learning in R. This implementation enables the
		learning of an optimal policy based on sample sequences
		consisting of states, actions and rewards. In addition, it
		supplies multiple predefined reinforcement learning algorithms,
		such as experience replay. Methodological details can be found
		in Sutton and Barto (1998) ISBN:0262039249.
