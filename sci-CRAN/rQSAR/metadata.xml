		QSAR Modeling with Multiple Algorithms: MLR, PLS, and Random
		Forest // Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)
		modeling is a valuable tool in computational chemistry and drug
		design, where it aims to predict the activity or property of
		chemical compounds based on their molecular structure. In this
		vignette, we present the 'rQSAR' package, which provides
		functions for variable selection and QSAR modeling using
		Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Squares (PLS),
		and Random Forest algorithms.
