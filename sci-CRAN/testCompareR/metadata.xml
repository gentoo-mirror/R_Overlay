		Comparing Two Diagnostic Tests with Dichotomous Results using
		Paired Data // Provides a method for comparing the results of
		two binary diagnostic tests using paired data. Users can
		rapidly perform descriptive and inferential statistics in a
		single function call. Options permit users to select which
		parameters they are interested in comparing and methods for
		correction for multiple comparisons. Confidence intervals are
		calculated using the methods with the best coverage. Hypothesis
		tests use the methods with the best asymptotic performance. A
		summary of the methods is available in Roldn-Nofuentes (2020)
		doi:10.1186/s12874-020-00988-y. This package is targeted at
		clinical researchers who want to rapidly and effectively
		compare results from binary diagnostic tests.
