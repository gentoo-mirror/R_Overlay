		Adjusted Relative Risk from Logistic Regression // Adjusted odds
		ratio conditional on potential confounders can be directly
		obtained from logistic regression. However, those adjusted odds
		ratios have been widely incorrectly interpreted as a relative
		risk. As relative risk is often of interest in public health,
		we provide a simple code to return adjusted relative risks from
		logistic regression model under potential confounders.
