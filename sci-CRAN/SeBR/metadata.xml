		Semiparametric Bayesian Regression Analysis // Monte Carlo
		sampling algorithms for semiparametric Bayesian regression
		analysis. These models feature a nonparametric (unknown)
		transformation of the data paired with widely-used regression
		models including linear regression, spline regression, quantile
		regression, and Gaussian processes. The transformation enables
		broader applicability of these key models, including for real-
		valued, positive, and compactly-supported data with challenging
		distributional features. The samplers prioritize computational
		scalability and, for most cases, Monte Carlo (not MCMC)
		sampling for greater efficiency. Details of the methods and
		algorithms are provided in Kowal and Wu (2024)
