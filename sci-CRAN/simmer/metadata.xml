		Discrete-Event Simulation for R // A process-oriented and
		trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) package for R.
		It is designed as a generic yet powerful framework. The
		architecture encloses a robust and fast simulation core written
		in 'C++' with automatic monitoring capabilities. It provides a
		rich and flexible R API that revolves around the concept of
		trajectory, a common path in the simulation model for entities
		of the same type.
