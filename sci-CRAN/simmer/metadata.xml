		Discrete-Event Simulation for R // A process-oriented and
		trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) package for R.
		It is designed as a generic yet powerful framework. The
		architecture encloses a robust and fast simulation core written
		in 'C++' with automatic monitoring capabilities. It provides a
		rich and flexible R API that revolves around the concept of
		trajectory, a common path in the simulation model for entities
		of the same type. Documentation about 'simmer' is provided by
		several vignettes included in this package, via the paper by
		Ucar, Smeets  Azcorra (2019, doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i02), and
		the paper by Ucar, Hernndez, Serrano  Azcorra (2018,
		doi:10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700960); see 'citation("simmer")' for
		details.
