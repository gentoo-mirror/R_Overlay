		developers when preparing a single package or a set of
		integrated packages to submit to CRAN. Provide additional
		resources to facilitate the automation of the following
		individual or batch processing: check local source packages;
		build local .tar.gz source files; install packages from local
		.tar.gz files; detect conflicts between function names in the
		environment. The additional resources include determining the
		identity and ordering of the packages to process when updating
		an imported package.
