		Arrange 'Grobs' in Tables // Tools to make it easier to work with
		"tables" of 'grobs'. The 'gtable' package defines a 'gtable'
		grob class that specifies a grid along with a list of grobs and
		their placement in the grid. Further the package makes it easy
		to manipulate and combine 'gtable' objects so that complex
		compositions can be build up sequentially.
