		Estimate Brain Networks Using Empirical Population Priors //
		Functions implementing the template ICA model proposed in Mejia
		et al. (2019) doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1679638 and the spatial
		template ICA model proposed in proposed in Mejia et al.
		(2020+). For both models, subject-level brain networks are
		estimated as deviations from known population-level networks,
		which can be estimated using standard ICA algorithms. Both
		models employ an expectation-maximization algorithm for
		estimation of the latent brain networks and unknown model
		parameters.
