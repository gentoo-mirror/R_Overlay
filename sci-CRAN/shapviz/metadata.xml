		SHAP Visualizations // Visualizations for SHAP (SHapley Additive
		exPlanations), such as waterfall plots, force plots, various
		types of importance plots, and dependence plots.  These plots
		act on a 'shapviz' object created from a matrix of SHAP values
		and a corresponding feature dataset. Wrappers for the R
		packages 'xgboost', 'lightgbm', 'fastshap', and 'treeshap' are
		added for convenience.  By separating visualization and
		computation, it is possible to display factor variables in
		graphs, even if the SHAP values are calculated by a model that
		requires numerical features. The plots are inspired by those
		provided by the 'shap' package in Python, but there is no
		dependency on it.
