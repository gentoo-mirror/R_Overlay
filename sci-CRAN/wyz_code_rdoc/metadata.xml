		Wizardry Code Offensive Programming R Documentation // Allows to
		generate automatically R documentation files from offensive
		programming test cases. It populates most of the section of the
		documentation content from the offensive programming
		instrumentation. This reduces greatly the package producer
		effort and time to get to a fully documented manual page for
		any instrumented function. Following documentation sections are
		now automatically filled from instrumentation data: title,
		description, usage, arguments, value, author, examples.
		Sections references, notes and keyword are instrumented to
		industrialize their production. Produced manual pages are ready
		for completion (e.g note section if needed), language and
		phrasal adjustments. Main task for the package producer is now
		review, no more content production.  Refer to chapter 11 of
		Offensive Programming Book, Fabien GELINEAU (2019,
		ISBN:979-10-699-4075-8), to learn about details and get value
		from this package.
