		Wizardry Code Offensive Programming R Documentation // Allows to
		generate on-demand or by batch, any R documentation file,
		whatever is kind, data, function, class or package. It
		populates documentation sections, either automatically or by
		considering your input. Input code could be standard R code or
		offensive programming code. Documentation content completeness
		depends on the type of code you use. With offensive programming
		code, expect generated documentation to be fully completed,
		from a format and content point of view. With some standard R
		code, you will have to activate post processing to fill-in any
		section that requires complements. Produced manual page
		validity is automatically tested against R documentation
		compliance rules. Documentation language proficiency, wording
		style, and phrasal adjustments remains your job.
