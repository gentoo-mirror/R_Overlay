		Interpretation of Point Forecasts as State-Dependent Quantiles
		and Expectiles // Estimate specification models for the state-
		dependent level of an optimal quantile/expectile forecast. Wald
		Tests and the test of overidentifying restrictions are
		implemented. Plotting of the estimated specification model is
		possible. The package contains two data sets with forecasts and
		realizations: the daily accumulated precipitation at London, UK
		from the high-resolution model of the European Centre for
		Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF, https://www.ecmwf.int/)
		and GDP growth Greenbook data by the US Federal Reserve. See
		Schmidt, Katzfuss and Gneiting (2015) arXiv:1506.01917 for more
		details on the identification and estimation of a directive
		behind a point forecast.
