		Robust Group Variable Screening Based on Maximum Lq-Likelihood
		Estimation // Produces a group screening procedure that is
		based on maximum Lq-likelihood estimation, to simultaneously
		account for the group structure and data contamination in
		variable screening. The methods are described in Li, Y., Li,
		R., Qin, Y., Lin, C.,  Yang, Y. (2021) Robust Group Variable
		Screening Based on Maximum Lq-likelihood Estimation. Statistics
		in Medicine, 40:6818-6834.doi:10.1002/sim.9212.
