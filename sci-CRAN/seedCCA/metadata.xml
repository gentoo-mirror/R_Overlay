		Seeded Canonical Correlation Analysis // Functions for dimension
		reduction through the seeded canonical correlation analysis are
		provided. A classical canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is
		one of useful statistical methods in multivariate data
		analysis, but it is limited in use due to the matrix inversion
		for large p small n data. To overcome this, a seeded CCA has
		been proposed in Im, Gang and Yoo (2015)
		\doi{10.1002/cem.2691}. The seeded CCA is a two-step procedure.
		The sets of variables are initially reduced by successively
		projecting cov(X,Y) or cov(Y,X) onto cov(X) and cov(Y),
		respectively, without loss of information on canonical
		correlation analysis, following Cook, Li and Chiaromonte (2007)
		\doi{10.1093/biomet/asm038} and Lee and Yoo (2014)
		\doi{10.1111/anzs.12057}. Then, the canonical correlation is
		finalized with the initially-reduced two sets of variables.
