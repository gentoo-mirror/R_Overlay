		Micro-RNA Quality Control and Diagnosis // A complete and
		dedicated analytical toolbox for quality control and diagnosis
		based on subject-related measurements of micro-RNA (miRNA)
		expressions. The package consists of a set of functions that
		allow to train, optimize and use a Bayesian classifier that
		relies on multiplets of measured miRNA expressions. The package
		also implements the quality control tools required to
		preprocess input datasets. In addition, the package provides a
		function to carry out a statistical analysis of miRNA
		expressions, which can give insights to improve the
		classifier's performance. The method implemented in the package
		was first introduced in L. Ricci, V. Del Vescovo, C. Cantaloni,
		M. Grasso, M. Barbareschi and M. A. Denti, "Statistical
		analysis of a Bayesian classifier based on the expression of
		miRNAs", BMC Bioinformatics 16:287, 2015
		doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0715-9. The package is thoroughly
		described in M. Castelluzzo, A. Perinelli, S. Detassis, M. A.
		Denti and L. Ricci, "MiRNA-QC-and-Diagnosis: An R package for
		diagnosis based on MiRNA expression", SoftwareX 12:100569, 2020
		doi:10.1016/j.softx.2020.100569. Please cite both these works
		if you use the package for your analysis. DISCLAIMER: The
