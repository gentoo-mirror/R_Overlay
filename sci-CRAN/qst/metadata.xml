		Store Tables in SQL Database // Provides functions for quickly
		writing (and reading back) a data.frame to file in 'SQLite'
		format. The name stands for *Store Tables using 'SQLite'*, or
		alternatively for *Quick Store Tables* (either way, it could be
		pronounced as *Quest*). For data.frames containing the
		supported data types it is intended to work as a drop-in
		replacement for the 'write_*()' and 'read_*()' functions
		provided by similar packages.
