		Tree-Based Varying Coefficient Regression for Generalized Linear
		and Ordinal Mixed Models // Recursive partitioning for varying
		coefficient generalized linear models and ordinal linear mixed
		models. Special features are coefficient-wise partitioning,
		non-varying coefficients and partitioning of time-varying
		variables in longitudinal regression. A description of a part
		of this package was published by Burgin and Ritschard (2017)
