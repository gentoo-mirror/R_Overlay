		Moving Sum Based Procedures for Changes in the Mean //
		Implementations of MOSUM-based statistical procedures and
		algorithms for detecting multiple changes in the mean. This
		comprises the MOSUM procedure for estimating multiple mean
		changes from Eichinger and Kirch (2018) doi:10.3150/16-BEJ887
		and the multiscale algorithmic extension from Cho and Kirch
		(2021) arXiv:1910.12486, as well as the bootstrap procedure for
		generating confidence intervals about the locations of change
		points as proposed in Cho and Kirch (2021) arXiv:2106.12844.
		See also Meier, Kirch and Cho (2021) doi:10.18637/jss.v097.i08
		which accompanies the R package.
