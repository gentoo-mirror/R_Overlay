		Moving Sum Based Procedures for Changes in the Mean //
		Implementations of MOSUM-based statistical procedures and
		algorithms for detecting multiple changes in the mean. This
		comprises the MOSUM procedure for estimating multiple mean
		changes from Eichinger and Kirch (2018) doi:10.3150/16-BEJ887
		and the multiscale algorithmic extension from Cho and Kirch
		(2022) doi:10.1007/s10463-021-00811-5, as well as the bootstrap
		procedure for generating confidence intervals about the
		locations of change points as proposed in Cho and Kirch (2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2022.107552. See also Meier, Kirch and Cho
		(2021) doi:10.18637/jss.v097.i08 which accompanies the R
		package.
