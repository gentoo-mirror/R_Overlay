		Annotation of Isotopes, Adducts and Fragmentation Adducts for in-
		Source LC/MS Metabolomics Data // Annotates data from liquid
		chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS)
		metabolomics experiments. Based on a network algorithm
		(O.Senan, A. Aguilar- Mogas, M. Navarro, O. Yanes, R.Guimer and
		M. Sales-Pardo, Metabolomics Conference (2016), Dublin),
		'CliqueMS' builds a weighted similarity network where nodes are
		features and edges are weighted according to the similarity of
		this features. Then it searches for the most plausible division
		of the similarity network into cliques (fully connected
		components). Finally it annotates metabolites within each
		clique, obtaining for each annotated metabolite the neutral
		mass and their features, corresponding to isotopes, ionization
		adducts and fragmentation adducts of that metabolite.
