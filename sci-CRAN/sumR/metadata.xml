		Approximates Summation of Discrete Series // Application of
		theoretical results which ensure that the summation of an
		infinite discrete series is within an arbitrary margin of error
		of its true value. The C code under the hood is shared through
		header files to allow users to sum their own low level
		functions as well. Based on the paper by Braden (1992) doi:
