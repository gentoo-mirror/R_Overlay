		Utility Functions for Multilevel Mediation Analysis // The
		ultimate goal is to support 2-2-1, 2-1-1, and 1-1-1 models for
		multilevel mediation, the option of a moderating variable for
		either the a, b, or both paths, and covariates. Currently the
		1-1-1 model is supported and several options of random effects;
		the initial code for bootstrapping was evaluated in simulations
		by Falk, Vogel, Hammami, and Mioevi (2024)
		doi:10.3758/s13428-023-02079-4. Support for Bayesian estimation
		using 'brms' comprises ongoing work. Currently only continuous
		mediators and outcomes are supported. Factors for any
		predictors must be numerically represented.
