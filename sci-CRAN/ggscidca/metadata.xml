		Plotting Decision Curve Analysis with Coloured Bars // Decision
		curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing
		prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences,
		requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and
		can be applied to models that have either continuous or
		dichotomous results. The 'ggscidca' package adds coloured bars
		of discriminant relevance to the traditional decision curve.
		Improved practicality and aesthetics. This method was described
		by Balachandran VP (2015) doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(14)71116-7.
