		Soil Organic Carbon and CN Ratio Driven Nitrogen Modelling
		Framework // Can be used to model the fate of soil organic
		carbon and soil organic nitrogen and to calculate N
		mineralisation rates. Provides a framework that numerically
		solves differential equations of soil organic carbon models
		based on first-order kinetics and extends these models to
		include the nitrogen component. The name 'sorcering' is an
		acronym for 'Soil ORganic Carbon  CN Ratio drIven Nitrogen
		modellinG framework'.
