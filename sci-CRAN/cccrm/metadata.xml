		Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Repeated (and Non-
		Repeated) Measures // Estimates the Concordance Correlation
		Coefficient to assess agreement. The scenarios considered are
		non-repeated measures, non-longitudinal repeated measures
		(replicates) and longitudinal repeated measures. It also
		includes the estimation of the one-way intraclass correlation
		coefficient also known as reliability index. The estimation
		approaches implemented are variance components and U-statistics
		approaches. Description of methods can be found in Fleiss
		(1986) doi:10.1002/9781118032923 and Carrasco et al. (2013)
