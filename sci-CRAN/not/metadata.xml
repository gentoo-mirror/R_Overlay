		Narrowest-Over-Threshold Change-Point Detection // Provides
		efficient implementation of the Narrowest-Over-Threshold
		methodology for detecting an unknown number of change-points
		occurring at unknown locations in one-dimensional data
		following deterministic signal + noise model, see  R.
		Baranowski, Y. Chen and P. Fryzlewicz (2019)
		doi:10.1111/rssb.12322. Currently implemented scenarios are:
		piecewise-constant signal, piecewise-constant signal with a
		heavy-tailed noise, piecewise-linear signal, piecewise-
		quadratic signal, piecewise-constant signal and with piecewise-
		constant variance of the noise.
