		Narrowest-Over-Threshold Change-Point Detection // Provides
		efficient implementation of the Narrowest-Over-Threshold
		methodology for detecting an unknown number of change-points
		occurring at unknown locations in one-dimensional data
		following 'deterministic signal + noise' model. Currently
		implemented scenarios are: piecewise-constant signal,
		piecewise-constant signal with a heavy-tailed noise, piecewise-
		linear signal, piecewise-quadratic signal, piecewise-constant
		signal and with piecewise-constant variance of the noise.
