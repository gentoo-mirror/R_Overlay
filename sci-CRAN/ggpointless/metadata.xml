		Emphasize Observations with Points // Add minimal emphasis to
		your plots. 'ggpointless' is a small extension of the 'ggplot2'
		library making it easy to highlight the first, or last
		observations, sample minimum and maximum. The goal is to
		provide additional context. Or just some visual sugar.
