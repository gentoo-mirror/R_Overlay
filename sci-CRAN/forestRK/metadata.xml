		Implements the Forest-R.K. Algorithm for Classification Problems
		// Provides functions that calculates common types of splitting
		criteria used in random forests for classification problems, as
		well as functions that make predictions based on a single tree
		or a Forest-R.K. model; the package also provides functions to
		generate importance plot for a Forest-R.K. model, as well as
		the 2D multidimensional-scaling plot of data points that are
		colour coded by their predicted class types by the Forest-R.K.
		model. This package is based on: Bernard, S., Heutte, L., Adam,
		S., (2008, ISBN:978-3-540-85983-3) "Forest-R.K.: A New Random
		Forest Induction Method", Fourth International Conference on
		Intelligent Computing, September 2008, Shanghai, China,
		pp.430-437.
