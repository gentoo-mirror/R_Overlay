		Swash-Backwash Model for the Single Epidemic Wave // The Swash-
		Backwash Model for the Single Epidemic Wave was developed by
		Cliff and Haggett (2006) doi:10.1007/s10109-006-0027-8 to model
		the velocity of spread of infectious diseases across space.
		This package enables the calculation of the Swash-Backwash
		Model for user-supplied panel data on regional infections. The
		package also provides additional functions for bootstrap
		confidence intervals and data management.
