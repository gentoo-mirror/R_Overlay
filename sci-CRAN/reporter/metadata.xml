		Creates Statistical Reports // Contains functions to create
		regulatory-style statistical reports. Originally designed to
		create tables, listings, and figures for the pharmaceutical,
		biotechnology, and medical device industries, these reports are
		generalized enough that they could be used in any industry.
		Generates text, rich-text, PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word file
		formats. The package specializes in printing wide and long
		tables with automatic page wrapping and splitting. Reports can
		be produced with a minimum of function calls, and without
		relying on other table packages.  The package supports titles,
		footnotes, page header, page footers, spanning headers, page by
		variables, and automatic page numbering.
