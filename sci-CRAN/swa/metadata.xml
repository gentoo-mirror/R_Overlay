		Subsampling Winner Algorithm for Classification // This algorithm
		conducts variable selection in the classification setting. It
		repeatedly subsamples variables and runs linear discriminant
		analysis (LDA) on the subsampled variables. Variables are
		scored based on the AUC and the t-statistics. Variables then
		enter a competition and the semi-finalist variables will be
		evaluated in a final round of LDA classification. The algorithm
		then outputs a list of variable selected. Qiao, Sun and Fan
