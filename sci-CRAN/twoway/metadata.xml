		Analysis of Two-Way Tables // Carries out analyses of two-way
		tables with one observation per cell, together with graphical
		displays for an additive fit and a diagnostic plot for
		removable 'non-additivity' via a power transformation of the
		response. It implements Tukey's Exploratory Data Analysis
		methods, including a 1-degree-of-freedom test for row*column
		'non-additivity', linear in the row and column effects.
