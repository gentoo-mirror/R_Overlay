		Construct Reproducible Analytic Data Sets as R Packages // A
		framework to help construct R data packages in a reproducible
		manner. Potentially time consuming processing of raw data sets
		into analysis ready data sets is done in a reproducible manner
		and decoupled from the usual 'R CMD build' process so that data
		sets can be processed into R objects in the data package and
		the data package can then be shared, built, and installed by
		others without the need to repeat computationally costly data
		processing.  The package maintains data provenance by turning
		the data processing scripts into package vignettes, as well as
		enforcing documentation and version checking of included data
		objects. Data packages can be version controlled on 'GitHub',
		and used to share data for manuscripts, collaboration and
		reproducible research.
