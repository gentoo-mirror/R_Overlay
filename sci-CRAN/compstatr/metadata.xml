		Tools for St. Louis Crime Data // Provides a set of tools for
		creating yearly data sets of St. Louis Metropolitan Police
		Department (SLMPD) crime data, which are available from January
		2008 onward as monthly CSV releases on their website
		(http:www.slmpd.org/Crimereports.shtml). Once data are
		validated and created (monthly data releases have varying
		numbers of columns as well as different column names and
		formats), 'compstatr' also provides functions for categorizing
		and mapping crimes in St. Louis. The categorization tools that
		are provided will also work with any police department that
		uses 5 and 6 digit numeric codes to identify specific crimes.
		These data provide researchers and policy makers detailed data
		for St. Louis, which in the last several years has had some of
		the highest or the highest violent crime rates in the United
		States.
