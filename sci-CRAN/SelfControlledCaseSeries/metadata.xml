		Self-Controlled Case Series // Execute the self-controlled case
		series (SCCS) design using observational data in the OMOP
		Common Data Model. Extracts all necessary data from the
		database and transforms it to the format required for SCCS. Age
		and season can be modeled using splines assuming constant
		hazard within calendar months. Event-dependent censoring of the
		observation period can be corrected for. Many exposures can be
		included at once (MSCCS), with regularization on all
		coefficients except for the exposure of interest. Includes
		diagnostics for all major assumptions of the SCCS.
