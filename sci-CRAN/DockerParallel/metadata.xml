		Using the Docker Container to Create R Workers on Local or Cloud
		Platform // This is the core package that provides both the
		user API and developer API to deploy the parallel cluster on
		the cloud using the container service. The user can call
		clusterPreset() to define the cloud service provider and
		container and makeDockerCluster() to create the cluster. The
		developer should see "developer's cookbook" on how to define
		the cloud provider and container.
