		ROBustness in Network // Many community detection algorithms have
		been developed in network analysis. However, their applications
		leave unaddressed the statistical validation of the results,
		for this reason we developed ROBIN (ROBustness In Network), a
		useful method for the validation of community detection. It has
		a double aim, it studies the robustness of a single community
		detection algorithm and compares two community detection
		algorithms to understand which provides the best partition.
