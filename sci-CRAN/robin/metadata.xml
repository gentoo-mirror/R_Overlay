		ROBustness in Network // In network analysis, many community
		detection algorithms have been developed. However, their
		applications leave unaddressed one important question: the
		statistical validation of the results. robin (ROBustness In
		Network) is an R package for the validation of community
		detection. It has a double aim: to study the robustness of a
		community detection algorithm and to compare the robustness of
		different community detection algorithms on the same network.
