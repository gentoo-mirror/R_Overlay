		ROBustness in Network // Assesses the robustness of the community
		structure of a network found by one or more community detection
		algorithm to give indications about their reliability. It
		detects if the community structure found by a set of algorithms
		is statistically significant and compares the different
		selected detection algorithms on the same network. robin helps
		to choose among different community detection algorithms the
		one that better fits the network of interest. Reference in
