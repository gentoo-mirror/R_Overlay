		Extra String Manipulation Functions // There are some things that
		I wish were easier with the 'stringr' or 'stringi' packages.
		The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers from
		strings. 'stringr' and 'stringi' make you figure out the
		regular expression for yourself; 'strex' takes care of this for
		you. There are many other handy functionalities in 'strex'.
		Contributions to this package are encouraged: it is intended as
		a miscellany of string manipulation functions that cannot be
		found in 'stringi' or 'stringr'.
