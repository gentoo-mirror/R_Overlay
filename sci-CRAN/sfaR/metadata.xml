		Stochastic Frontier Analysis using R // Maximum likelihood
		estimation for stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of production
		(profit) and cost functions. The package includes several
		distributions for the one-sided error term (i.e. Rayleigh,
		Gamma, Weibull, lognormal, uniform, generalized exponential and
		truncated skewed Laplace) as well as the latent class
		stochastic frontier model (LCM) as described in Dakpo et al.
		(2021) doi:10.1111/1477-9552.12422. Several possibilities in
		terms of optimization algorithms are proposed.
