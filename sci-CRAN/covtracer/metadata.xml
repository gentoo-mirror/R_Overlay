		Contextualizing Tests // Dissects a package environment or 'covr'
		coverage object in order to cross reference tested code with
		the lines that are evaluated, as well as linking those
		evaluated lines to the documentation that they are described
		within. Connecting these three pieces of information provides a
		mechanism of linking tests to documented behaviors.
