		Choice of Omega in the BAC Algorithm // The Bayesian Adjustment
		for Confounding (BAC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2012) can be used
		to estimate the causal effect of a continuous exposure on a
		continuous outcome. This package provides an approximate
		sensitivity analysis of BAC with regards to the hyperparameter
		omega. BACprior also provides functions to guide the user in
		their choice of an appropriate omega value. The method is based
		on Lefebvre, Atherton and Talbot (2014).
