		Visualize the Effect of a Continuous Variable on a Time-to-Event
		Outcome // Graphically display the (causal) effect of a
		continuous variable on a time-to-event outcome using multiple
		different types of plots based on g-computation. Those
		functions include, among others, survival area plots, survival
		contour plots, survival quantile plots and 3D surface plots.
		Due to the use of g-computation, all plot allow confounder-
		adjustment naturally. For details, see Robin Denz, Nina
		Timmesfeld (2023) doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000001630.
