		Tools for Biostatistics, Public Policy, and Law // Statistical
		tests widely utilized in biostatistics, public policy, and law.
		Along with the well-known tests for equality of means and
		variances, randomness, and measures of relative variability,
		the package contains new robust tests of symmetry, omnibus and
		directional tests of normality, and their graphical
		counterparts such as robust QQ plot, robust trend tests for
		variances, etc. All implemented tests and methods are
		illustrated by simulations and real-life examples from legal
		statistics, economics, and biostatistics.
