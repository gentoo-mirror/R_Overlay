		Ternary Residual Effect Designs // There are some experimental
		scenarios where each experimental unit receives a sequence of
		treatments across multiple periods, and treatment effects
		persist beyond the period of application. It focuses on the
		construction and calculation of the parametric value of the
		residual effect designs balanced for carryover effects, also
		referred to as crossover designs, change-over designs, or
		repeated measurements designs (Aggarwal and Jha,
		2010doi:10.1080/15598608.2010.10412013). The primary objective
		of the package is to generate a new class of Balanced Ternary
		Residual Effect Designs (BTREDs), balanced for carryover
		effects tailored explicitly for situations where the number of
		periods is less than or equal to the number of treatments. In
		addition, the package provides four new classes of Partially
		Balanced Ternary Residual Effect Designs (PBTREDs), constructed
		using incomplete block designs, initial sequences, and
		rectangular association scheme. In addition, one extra function
		is included to help study the parametric properties of a given
		residual effect design.
