		Bayesian Neural Network with 'Stan' // Offers a flexible formula-
		based interface for building and training Bayesian Neural
		Networks powered by 'Stan'. The package supports modeling
		complex relationships while providing rigorous uncertainty
		quantification via posterior distributions. With features like
		user chosen priors, clear predictions, and support for
		regression, binary, and multi-class classification, it is well-
		suited for applications in clinical trials, finance, and other
		fields requiring robust Bayesian inference and decision-making.
