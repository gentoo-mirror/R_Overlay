		Distance-Based k-Medoids // Algorithms of distance-based
		k-medoids clustering: simple and fast k-medoids, ranked
		k-medoids, and increasing number of clusters in k-medoids.
		Calculate distances for mixed variable data such as Gower,
		Podani, Wishart, Huang, Harikumar-PV, and Ahmad-Dey. Cluster
		validation applies internal and relative criteria. The internal
		criteria includes silhouette index and shadow values. The
		relative criterium applies bootstrap procedure producing a
		heatmap with a flexible reordering matrix algorithm such as
		complete, ward, or average linkages. The cluster result can be
		plotted in a marked barplot or pca biplot.
