		Robust Generalized Linear Models (GLM) using Mixtures // Robust
		generalized linear models (GLM) using a mixture method, as
		described in Beath (2018) doi:10.1080/02664763.2017.1414164.
		This assumes that the data are a mixture of standard
		observations, being a generalised linear model, and outlier
		observations from an overdispersed generalized linear model.
		The overdispersed linear model is obtained by including a
		normally distributed random effect in the linear predictor of
		the generalized linear model.
