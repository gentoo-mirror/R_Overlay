		Integrating Multiple Modalities of High Throughput Assays Using
		Item Response Theory // Provides a systematic framework for
		integrating multiple modalities of assays profiled on the same
		set of samples. The goal is to identify genes that are altered
		in cancer either marginally or consistently across different
		assays. The heterogeneity among different platforms and
		different samples are automatically adjusted so that the
		overall alteration magnitude can be accurately inferred. See
