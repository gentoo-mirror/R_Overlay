		Concordances for 'R Markdown' // Supports concordances in 'R
		Markdown' documents.  This currently allows the original source
		location in the '.Rmd' file of errors detected by 'HTML tidy'
		to be found more easily, and potentially allows forward and
		reverse search in 'HTML' and 'LaTeX' documents produced from 'R
		Markdown'.  The 'LaTeX' support has been included in the most
		recent development version of the 'patchDVI' package.
