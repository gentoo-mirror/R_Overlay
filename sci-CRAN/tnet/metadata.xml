		Weighted, Two-Mode, and Longitudinal Networks Analysis // Binary
		ties limit the richness of network analyses as relations are
		unique. The two-mode structure contains a number of features
		lost when projection it to a one-mode network. Longitudinal
		datasets allow for an understanding of the causal relationship
		among ties, which is not the case in cross-sectional datasets
		as ties are dependent upon each other.
