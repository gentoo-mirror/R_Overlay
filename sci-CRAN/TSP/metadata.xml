		Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) // Basic infrastructure and
		some algorithms for the traveling salesperson problem (also
		traveling salesman problem; TSP). The package provides some
		simple algorithms and an interface to the Concorde TSP solver
		and its implementation of the Chained-Lin-Kernighan heuristic.
		The code for Concorde itself is not included in the package and
		has to be obtained separately. Hahsler and Hornik (2007)
