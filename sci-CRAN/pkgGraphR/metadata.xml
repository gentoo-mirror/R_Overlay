		Graph the Relationship Between Functions in an R Package // It is
		often useful when developing an R package to track the
		relationship between functions in order to appropriately test
		and track changes. This package generates a graph of the
		relationship between all R functions in a package. It can also
		be used on any directory containing .R files which can be very
		useful for 'shiny' apps or other non-package workflows.
