		Nearest Centroid (NC) Sampling // Provides functionality for
		performing Nearest Centroid (NC) Sampling. The NC sampling
		procedure was developed for forestry applications and selects
		plots for ground measurement so as to maximize the efficiency
		of imputation estimates. It uses multiple auxiliary variables
		and multivariate clustering to search for an optimal sample.
