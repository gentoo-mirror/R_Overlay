		Biomarker Data Set by Vermeulen et al. (2009) // The biomarker
		data set by Vermeulen et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70154-8 is provided. The data source,
		however, is by Ruijter et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.08.011. The original data set may be
		downloaded from https://medischebiologie.nl/wp-
		content/uploads/2019/02/qpcrdatamethods.zip. This data set is
		for a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
		experiment that comprises the raw fluorescence data of 24,576
		amplification curves. This data set comprises 59 genes of
		interest and 5 reference genes. Each gene was assessed on 366
		neuroblastoma complementary DNA (cDNA) samples and on 18
		standard dilution series samples (10-fold 5-point dilution
		series x 3 replicates + no template controls (NTC) x 3
		replicates).
