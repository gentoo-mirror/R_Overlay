		Decorrelation Projection Scalable to High Dimensional Data //
		Data whitening is a widely used preprocessing step to remove
		correlation structure since statistical models often assume
		independence. Here we use a probabilistic model of the observed
		data to apply a whitening transformation. This Gaussian Inverse
		Wishart Empirical Bayes model substantially reduces
		computational complexity, and regularizes the eigen-values of
		the sample covariance matrix to improve out-of-sample
		performance.
