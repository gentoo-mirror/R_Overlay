		Systems Insights from Generation of Hydroclimatic Timeseries // A
		tool to create hydroclimate scenarios, stress test systems and
		visualize system performance in scenario-neutral climate change
		impact assessments. Scenario-neutral approaches 'stress-test'
		the performance of a modelled system by applying a wide range
		of plausible hydroclimate conditions (see Brown  Wilby (2012)
		doi:10.1029/2012EO410001 and Prudhomme et al. (2010)
		doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.06.043). These approaches allow the
		identification of hydroclimatic variables that affect the
		vulnerability of a system to hydroclimate variation and change.
		This tool enables the generation of perturbed time series using
		a range of approaches including simple scaling of observed time
		series (e.g. Culley et al. (2016) doi:10.1002/2015WR018253) and
		stochastic simulation of perturbed time series via an inverse
		approach (see Guo et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.025). It incorporates a number of
		stochastic weather models to generate hydroclimate variables on
		a daily basis (e.g. precipitation, temperature, potential
		evapotranspiration) and allows a variety of different
		hydroclimate variable properties, herein called attributes, to
		be perturbed. Options are included for the easy integration of
		existing system models both internally in R and externally for
		seamless 'stress-testing'. A suite of visualization options for
		the results of a scenario-neutral analysis (e.g. plotting
		performance spaces and overlaying climate projection
		information) are also included. As further developments in
		scenario-neutral approaches occur the tool will be updated to
		incorporate these advances.
