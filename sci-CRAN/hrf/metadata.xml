		Hemodynamic Response Function // Computes the hemodynamic
		response function (HRF) for task functional magnetic resonance
		imaging (fMRI) data. Also includes functions for constructing a
		design matrix from task fMRI event timings, and for comparing
		multiple design matrices in a general linear model (GLM). A
		wrapper function is provided for GLM analysis of CIFTI-format
		data. Lastly, there are supporting functions which provide
		visual summaries of the HRFs and design matrices.
