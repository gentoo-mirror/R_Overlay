		Implement Data Analysis Workflows with Pipelines // A lightweight
		yet powerful framework for creating data analysis pipelines.
		You build your pipelines simply by defining a sequence of R
		functions and 'pipeflow' takes care of tracking dependencies
		among steps and managing all the analysis parameters. The
		framework is easy to get started with for the typical R user,
		but also provides advanced features to enable complex
		workflows.
