		Lightweight, General-Purpose Data Analysis Pipelines // A
		lightweight yet powerful framework for building robust data
		analysis pipelines. With 'pipeflow', you initialize a pipeline
		with your dataset and construct your workflow step by step by
		seamlessly adding R functions. Modify, remove, or insert steps
		at any stage while 'pipeflow' ensures the integrity and
		correctness of your pipeline. Designed to help you focus on the
		'what' rather than the 'how', this package simplifies the
		implementation of complex workflows, making even large-scale
		data analysis projects manageable, adaptable, and reusable with
		ease.
