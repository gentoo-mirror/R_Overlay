		Simple Git Client for R // Simple git client for R based on
		'libgit2' with support for SSH and HTTPS remotes. All functions
		in 'gert' use basic R data types (such as vectors and data-
		frames) for their arguments and return values. User credentials
		are shared with command line 'git' through the git-credential
		store and ssh keys stored on disk or ssh-agent. On Linux, a
		somewhat recent version of 'libgit2' is required; we provide a
		'PPA' for older Ubuntu 'LTS' versions.
