		Group-Sequential Procedures with Multiple Hypotheses // It is
		often challenging to strongly control the family-wise type-1
		error rate in the group-sequential trials with multiple
		endpoints (hypotheses). The inflation of type-1 error rate
		comes from two sources (S1) repeated testing individual
		hypothesis and (S2) simultaneous testing multiple hypotheses.
		The 'MultiGroupSequential' package is intended to help
		researchers to tackle this challenge. The procedures provided
		include the sequential procedures described in Luo and Quan
		(2023) doi:10.1080/19466315.2023.2191989 and the graphical
		procedure proposed by Maurer and Bretz (2013)
		doi:10.1080/19466315.2013.807748. Luo and Quan (2013) describes
		three procedures, and the functions to implement these
		procedures are (1) seqgspgx() implements a sequential graphical
		procedure based on the group-sequential p-values; (2)
		seqgsphh() implements a sequential Hochberg/Hommel procedure
		based on the group-sequential p-values; and (3) seqqvalhh()
		implements a sequential Hochberg/Hommel procedure based on the
		q-values. In addition, seqmbgx() implements the sequential
		graphical procedure described in Maurer and Bretz (2013).
