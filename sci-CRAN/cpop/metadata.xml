		Detection of Multiple Changes in Slope in Univariate Time-Series
		// Detects multiple changes in slope using the CPOP dynamic
		programming approach of Fearnhead, Maidstone, and Letchford
		(2019) doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1512868. This method finds the
		best continuous piecewise linear fit to data under a criterion
		that measures fit to data using the residual sum of squares,
		but penalizes complexity based on an L0 penalty on changes in
		slope.
