		Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing // A Bayesian approach to
		estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases from
		incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks.
		'NobBS' learns the reporting delay distribution and the time
		evolution of the epidemic curve to produce smoothed nowcasts in
		both stable and time-varying case reporting settings, as
		described in McGough et al. (2019) doi:10.1101/663823.
