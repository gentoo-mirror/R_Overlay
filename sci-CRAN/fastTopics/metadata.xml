		Fast Algorithms for Fitting Topic Models and Non-Negative Matrix
		Factorizations to Count Data // Implements fast, scalable
		optimization algorithms for fitting topic models ("grade of
		membership" models) and non-negative matrix factorizations to
		count data. The methods exploit the special relationship
		between the multinomial topic model (also, "probabilistic
		latent semantic indexing") and Poisson non-negative matrix
		factorization. The package provides tools to compare, annotate
		and visualize model fits, including functions to efficiently
		create "structure plots" and identify key features in topics.
		The 'fastTopics' package is a successor to the 'CountClust'
		package.
