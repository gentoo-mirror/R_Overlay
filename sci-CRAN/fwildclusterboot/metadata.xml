		Fast Wild Cluster Bootstrap Inference for Linear Regression
		Models // Implementation of the fast algorithm for wild cluster
		bootstrap inference developed in Roodman et al (2019, STATA
		Journal) for linear regression models
		https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1536867X19830877,
		which makes it feasible to quickly calculate bootstrap test
		statistics based on a large number of bootstrap draws even for
		large samples - as long as the number of bootstrapping clusters
		is not too large. Multiway clustering, regression weights,
		bootstrap weights, fixed effects and subcluster bootstrapping
		are supported. Further, both restricted (WCR) and unrestricted
		(WCU) bootstrap are supported. Methods are provided for a
		variety of fitted models, including 'lm()', 'feols()' (from
		package 'fixest') and 'felm()' (from package 'lfe').
