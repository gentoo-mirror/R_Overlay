		Calculate Water Vapor Measures from Temperature and Dew Point //
		Vapor pressure, relative humidity, absolute humidity, specific
		humidity, and mixing ratio are commonly used water vapor
		measures in meteorology. This R package provides functions for
		calculating saturation vapor pressure (hPa), partial water
		vapor pressure (Pa), relative humidity (%), absolute humidity
		(kg/m^3), specific humidity (kg/kg), and mixing ratio (kg/kg)
		from temperature (K) and dew point (K). Conversion functions
		between humidity measures are also provided.
