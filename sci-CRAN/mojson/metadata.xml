		A Serialization-Style Flattening and Description for JSON //
		Support JSON flattening in a long data frame way, where the
		nesting keys will be stored in the absolute path. It also
		provides an easy way to summarize the basic description of a
		JSON list. The idea of 'mojson' is to transform a JSON object
		in an absolute serialization way, which means the early key-
		value pairs will appear in the heading rows of the resultant
		data frame. 'mojson' also provides an alternative way of
		comparing two different JSON lists, returning the
		left/inner/right-join style results.
