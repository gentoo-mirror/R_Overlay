		Horizontal 'ggplot2' Components // A 'ggplot2' extension that
		provides flipped components: horizontal versions of 'Stats' and
		'Geoms', and vertical versions of 'Positions'. This package is
		now superseded by 'ggplot2' itself which now has full native
		support for horizontal layouts. It remains available for
		backward compatibility.
