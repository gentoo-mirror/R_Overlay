		Small Area Estimation with Measurement Error // A set of
		functions and datasets implementation of small area estimation
		when auxiliary variable is measured with error. These functions
		provide a empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP)
		estimator and mean squared error (MSE) estimator of the EBLUP.
		These models were developed by Ybarra and Lohr (2008)
