		Lint 'roxygen2'-Generated Documentation // Provides formatting
		linting to 'roxygen2' tags. Linters report 'roxygen2' tags that
		do not conform to a standard style. These linters can be a
		helpful check for building more consistent documentation and to
		provide reminders about best practices or checks for typos.
		Default linting suites are provided for common style guides
		such as the one followed by the 'tidyverse', though custom
		linters can be registered by other packages or be custom-
		tailored to a specific package.
