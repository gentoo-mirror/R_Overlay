		A Framework for Building, Managing, and Stitching 'shiny' Modules
		into Reproducible Workflows // A unifying framework for
		managing and deploying 'shiny' applications that consist of
		modules, where an "app" is a tab-based workflow that guides a
		user step-by-step through an analysis. The 'shinymgr' app
		builder "stitches" 'shiny' modules together so that outputs
		from one module serve as inputs to the next, creating an
		analysis pipeline that is easy to implement and maintain. Users
		of 'shinymgr' apps can save analyses as an RDS file that fully
		reproduces the analytic steps and can be ingested into an R
		Markdown report for rapid reporting. In short, developers use
		the 'shinymgr' framework to write modules and seamlessly
		combine them into 'shiny' apps, and users of these apps can
		execute reproducible analyses that can be incorporated into
		reports for rapid dissemination.
