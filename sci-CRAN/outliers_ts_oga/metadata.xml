		Efficient Outlier Detection for Large Time Series Databases //
		Programs for detecting and cleaning outliers in single time
		series and in time series from homogeneous and heterogeneous
		databases using an Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm (OGA) for
		saturated linear regression models. The programs implement the
		procedures presented in the paper entitled "Efficient Outlier
		Detection for Large Time Series Databases" by Pedro Galeano,
		Daniel Pea and Ruey S. Tsay (2025), working paper, Universidad
		Carlos III de Madrid. Version 1.1.1 contains some improvements
		in parallelization with respect to version 1.0.1.
