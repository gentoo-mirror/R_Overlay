		Automatic Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Using the Ata
		Method // The Ata method (Yapar et al. (2019)
		doi:10.15672/hujms.461032), an alternative to exponential
		smoothing (described in Yapar (2016)
		doi:10.15672/HJMS.201614320580, Yapar et al. (2017)
		doi:10.15672/HJMS.2017.493), is a new univariate time series
		forecasting method which provides innovative solutions to
		issues faced during the initialization and optimization stages
		of existing forecasting methods. Forecasting performance of the
		Ata method is superior to existing methods both in terms of
		easy implementation and accurate forecasting. It can be applied
		to non-seasonal or seasonal time series which can be decomposed
		into four components (remainder, level, trend and seasonal).
		This methodology performed well on the M3 and M4-competition
		data. This package was written based on Ali Sabri Taylans PhD
		dissertation.
