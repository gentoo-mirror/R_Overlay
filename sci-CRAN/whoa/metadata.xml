		Evaluation of Genotyping Error in Genotype-by-Sequencing Data //
		This is a small, lightweight package that lets users
		investigate the distribution of genotypes in genotype-by-
		sequencing (GBS) data where they expect (by and large) Hardy-
		Weinberg equilibrium, in order to assess rates of genotyping
		errors and the dependence of those rates on read depth.  It
		implements a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler using
		'Rcpp' to compute a Bayesian estimate of what we call the
		heterozygote miscall rate for restriction-associated digest
		(RAD) sequencing data and other types of reduced representation
		GBS data. It also provides functions to generate plots of
		expected and observed genotype frequencies. Some background on
		these topics can be found in a recent paper "Recent advances in
		conservation and population genomics data analysis" by
		Hendricks et al. (2018) doi:10.1111/eva.12659, and another
		paper describing the MCMC approach is in preparation with
		Gordon Luikart and Thierry Gosselin.
