		Weighted Metrics, Scoring Functions and Performance Measures for
		Machine Learning // Provides weighted versions of several
		metrics, scoring functions and performance measures used in
		machine learning, including average unit deviances of the
		Bernoulli, Tweedie, Poisson, and Gamma distributions, see
		Jorgensen B. (1997, ISBN: 978-0412997112). The package also
		contains a weighted version of generalized R-squared, see e.g.
		Cohen, J. et al. (2002, ISBN: 978-0805822236). Furthermore,
		'dplyr' chains are supported.
