		Weighted Metrics and Performance Measures for Machine Learning //
		Provides weighted versions of several metrics and performance
		measures used in machine learning, including average unit
		deviances of the Bernoulli, Tweedie, Poisson, and Gamma
		distributions, see e.g. Ohlsson E. and Johansson B. (2015,
		ISBN: 978-3642107900). The package also contains a weighted
		version of generalized R-squared, see e.g. Cohen, Jacob. et al.
		(2002, ISBN: 978-0805822236). Furthermore, 'dplyr' chains are
		supported.
