		'MsgPack' C++ Header Files // 'MessagePack' is an efficient
		binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among
		multiple languages like 'JSON'. But it is faster and smaller.
		Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical
		short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the
		strings themselves. This package provides headers from the
		'msgpack-c' implementation for C and C++(11) for use by R,
		particularly 'Rcpp'. The included 'msgpack-c' headers are
		licensed under the Boost Software License (Version 1.0); the
		code added by this package as well the R integration are
		licensed under the GPL (= 2). See the files 'COPYRIGHTS' and
		'AUTHORS' for a full list of  copyright holders and
		contributors to 'msgpack-c'.
