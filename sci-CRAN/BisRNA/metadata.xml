		Analysis of RNA Cytosine-5 Methylation // Bisulfite-treated RNA
		non-conversion in a set of samples is analysed as follows :
		each sample's non-conversion distribution is identified to a
		Poisson distribution. P-values adjusted for multiple testing
		are calculated in each sample. Combined non-conversion P-values
		and standard errors are calculated on the intersection of the
		set of samples. For further details, see C Legrand, F Tuorto, M
		Hartmann, R Liebers, D Jakob, M Helm and F Lyko (2017)
