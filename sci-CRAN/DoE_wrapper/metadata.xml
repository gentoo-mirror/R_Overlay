		Wrapper Package for Design of Experiments Functionality //
		Various kinds of designs for (industrial) experiments can be
		created. The package uses, and sometimes enhances, design
		generation routines from other packages. So far, response
		surface designs from package rsm, latin hypercube samples from
		packages lhs and DiceDesign, and D-optimal designs from package
		AlgDesign have been implemented.
