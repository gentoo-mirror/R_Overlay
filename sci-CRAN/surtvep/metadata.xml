		Cox Non-Proportional Hazards Model with Time-Varying Coefficients
		// Fit Cox non-proportional hazards models with time-varying
		coefficients. Both unpenalized procedures (Newton and proximal
		Newton) and penalized procedures (P-splines and smoothing
		splines) are included using B-spline basis functions for
		estimating time-varying coefficients. For penalized procedures,
		cross validations, mAIC, TIC or GIC are implemented to select
		tuning parameters. Utilities for carrying out post-estimation
		visualization, summarization, point-wise confidence interval
		and hypothesis testing are also provided. For more information,
		see Wu et al. (2022) doi: 10.1007/s10985-021-09544-2 and Luo et
		al. (2023) doi:10.1177/09622802231181471.
