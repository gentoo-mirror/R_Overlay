		Density Estimation and Random Number Generation with Distribution
		Element Trees // Density estimation for possibly large data
		sets and conditional/unconditional random number generation or
		bootstrapping with distribution element trees. The function
		'det.construct' translates a dataset into a distribution
		element tree. To evaluate the probability density based on a
		previously computed tree at arbitrary query points, the
		function 'det.query' is available. The functions 'det1' and
		'det2' provide density estimation and plotting for one- and
		two-dimensional datasets. Conditional/unconditional smooth
		bootstrapping from an available distribution element tree can
		be performed by 'det.rnd'. For more details on distribution
		element trees, see: Meyer, D.W. (2016) arXiv:1610.00345 or
		Meyer, D.W., Statistics and Computing (2017)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9751-9 and Meyer, D.W. (2017)
