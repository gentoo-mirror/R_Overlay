		Learning Causal Cyclic Graphs from Unknown Shift Interventions //
		Code for 'backShift', an algorithm to estimate the connectivity
		matrix of a directed (possibly cyclic) graph with hidden
		variables. The underlying system is required to be linear and
		we assume that observations under different shift interventions
		are available. For more details, see arXiv:1506.02494.
