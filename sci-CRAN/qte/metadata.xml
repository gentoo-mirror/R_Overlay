		Quantile Treatment Effects // Provides several methods for
		computing the Quantile Treatment Effect (QTE) and Quantile
		Treatment Effect on the Treated (QTET). The main cases covered
		are (i) Treatment is randomly assigned, (ii) Treatment is as
		good as randomly assigned after conditioning on some covariates
		(also called conditional independence or selection on
		observables), (iii) Identification is based on a Difference in
		Differences assumption (several varieties are available in the
		package).
