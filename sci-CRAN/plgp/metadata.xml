		Particle Learning of Gaussian Processes // Sequential Monte Carlo
		(SMC) inference for fully Bayesian Gaussian process (GP)
		regression and classification models by particle learning (PL)
		following Gramacy  Polson (2011) arXiv:0909.5262. The
		sequential nature of inference and the active learning (AL)
		hooks provided facilitate thrifty sequential design (by
		entropy) and optimization (by improvement) for classification
		and regression models, respectively. This package essentially
		provides a generic PL interface, and functions (arguments to
		the interface) which implement the GP models and AL heuristics.
		Functions for a special, linked, regression/classification GP
		model and an integrated expected conditional improvement (IECI)
		statistic provide for optimization in the presence of unknown
		constraints. Separable and isotropic Gaussian, and single-index
		correlation functions are supported. See the examples section
		of ?plgp and demo(package="plgp") for an index of demos.
