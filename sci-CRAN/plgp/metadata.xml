		Particle Learning of Gaussian Processes // Sequential Monte Carlo
		inference for fully Bayesian Gaussian process (GP) regression
		and classification models by particle learning (PL).  The
		sequential nature of inference and the active learning (AL)
		hooks provided facilitate thrifty sequential design (by
		entropy) and optimization (by improvement) for classification
		and regression models, respectively. This package essentially
		provides a generic PL interface, and functions (arguments to
		the interface) which implement the GP models and AL heuristics.
		Functions for a special, linked, regression/classification GP
		model and an integrated expected conditional improvement (IECI)
		statistic is provides for optimization in the presence of
		unknown constraints. Separable and isotropic Gaussian, and
		single-index correlation functions are supported. See the
		examples section of ?plgp and demo(package="plgp") for an index
		of demos
