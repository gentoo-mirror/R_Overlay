		Gadget is the Globally-Applicable Area Disaggregated General
		Ecosystem Toolbox // A statistical ecosystem modelling package,
		taking many features of the ecosystem into account. Gadget
		works by running an internal model based on many parameters,
		and then comparing the data from the output of this model to
		real data to get a goodness-of-fit likelihood score. These
		parameters can then be adjusted, and the model re-run, until an
		optimum is found, which corresponds to the model with the
		lowest likelihood score. Gadget allows the user to include a
		number of features into an ecosystem model: One or more
		species, each of which may be split into multiple stocks;
		multiple areas with migration between areas; predation between
		and within species; maturation; reproduction and recruitment;
		multiple commercial and survey fleets taking catches from the
		populations. For more details see
		https://hafro.github.io/gadget2. This is the C++ Gadget2
		runtime, making it available for R.
