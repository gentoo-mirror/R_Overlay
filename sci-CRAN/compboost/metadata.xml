		C++ Implementation of Component-Wise Boosting // C++
		implementation of component-wise boosting implementation of
		component-wise boosting written in C++ to obtain high runtime
		performance and full memory control. The main idea is to
		provide a modular class system which can be extended without
		editing the source code. Therefore, it is possible to use R
		functions as well as C++ functions for custom base-learners,
		losses, logging mechanisms or stopping criteria.
