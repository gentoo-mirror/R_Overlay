		Bayesian Deming Regression for Method Comparison // Regression
		methods to quantify the relation between two measurement
		methods are provided by this package. The focus is on a
		Bayesian Deming regressions family. With a Bayesian method the
		Deming regression can be run in a traditional fashion or can be
		run in a robust way just decreasing the degree of freedom d.f.
		of the sampling distribution. With d.f. = 1 an extremely robust
		Cauchy distribution can be sampled. Moreover, models for
		dealing with heteroscedastic data are also provided. For
		reference see G. Pioda (2024) https://piodag.github.io/bd1/.
