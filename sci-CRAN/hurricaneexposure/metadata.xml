		Explore and Map County-Level Hurricane Exposure in the United
		States // Allows users to create time series of tropical storm
		exposure histories for chosen counties for a number of hazard
		metrics (wind, rain, distance from the storm, etc.). This
		package interacts with data available through the
		'hurricaneexposuredata' package, which is available in a 'drat'
		repository. To access this data package, run
		'install.packages("hurricaneexposuredata", repos =
		"https://geanders.github.io/drat/", type = "source")'. The size
		of the 'hurricaneexposuredata' package is approximately 25 MB.
		This work was supported in part by grants from the National
		Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R00ES022631), the
		National Science Foundation (1331399), and a NASA Applied
		Sciences Program/Public Health Program Grant (NNX09AV81G).
