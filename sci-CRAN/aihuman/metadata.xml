		Experimental Evaluation of Algorithm-Assisted Human Decision-
		Making // Provides statistical methods for analyzing
		experimental evaluation of the causal impacts of algorithmic
		recommendations on human decisions developed by Imai, Jiang,
		Greiner, Halen, and Shin (2023) doi:10.1093/jrsssa/qnad010 and
		Ben-Michael, Greiner, Huang, Imai, Jiang, and Shin (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2403.12108. The data used for this paper,
		and made available here, are interim, based on only half of the
		observations in the study and (for those observations) only
		half of the study follow-up period. We use them only to
		illustrate methods, not to draw substantive conclusions.
