		Population Downscaling Using Areal Interpolation // Downscaling
		of population data obtained by census surveys using areal
		interpolation. Given a set of source zone polygons such as
		census tracts or city blocks alongside with population counts
		and a target zone of incogruent yet superimposed polygon
		features (such as individual buildings) populR transforms
		population counts from the former to the latter using Areal
		Weighting and Volume Weighting Interpolation methods.
