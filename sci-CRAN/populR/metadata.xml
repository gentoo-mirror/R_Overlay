		Areal Interpolation of Population Data // Areal interpolation of
		population data obtained by census surveys. Given a set of
		source zone polygons such as census tracts or city blocks
		alongside with population counts and a target zone of
		incogruent yet superimposed polygon features (such as
		individual buildings) populR transforms population counts from
		the former to the latter using Areal Weighting and Volume
		Weighting Interpolation methods.
