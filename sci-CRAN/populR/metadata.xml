		Population Down-Scaling // Areal interpolation of population data
		obtained by census surveys. Given a set of source zone polygons
		such as census tracts or city blocks alongside with population
		counts and a target zone of incogruent yet superimposed polygon
		features (such as individual buildings) populR transforms
		population counts from the former to the latter using Areal
		Weighted and Volume Weighted Interpolation methods.
