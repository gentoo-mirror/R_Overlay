		Population Downscaling Using Areal Interpolation // Given a set
		of source zone polygons such as census tracts or city blocks
		alongside with population counts and a target zone of
		incogruent yet superimposed polygon features (such as
		individual buildings) populR transforms population counts from
		the former to the latter using Areal Interpolation methods.
