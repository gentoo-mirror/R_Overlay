		Density Equality Testing // Methods for testing the equality
		between groups of estimated density functions. The package
		implements FDET (Fourier-based Density Equality Testing) and
		MDET (Moment-based Density Equality Testing), two new
		approaches introduced by the author. Both methods extend an
		earlier testing approach by Delicado (2007), "Functional
		k-sample problem when data are density functions"
		doi:10.1007/s00180-007-0047-y, which is referred to as DET
		(Density Equality Testing) in this package for clarity. FDET
		compares groups of densities based on their global shape using
		Fourier transforms, while MDET tests for differences in
		distributional moments. All methods are described in Anarat,
		Krutmann and Schwender (2025), "Testing for Differences in
		Extrinsic Skin Aging Based on Density Functions" (Submitted).
