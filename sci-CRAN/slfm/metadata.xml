		Tools for Fitting Sparse Latent Factor Model // Set of tools to
		find coherent patterns in microarray data using a Bayesian
		Sparse Latent Factor Model - SLFM; see Duarte and Mayrink
		(2015) DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-12454-4_15. Considerable effort
		has been put into making slfm fast and memory efficient,
		turning it an interesting alternative to simpler methods in
		terms of execution time. It implements versions of the SLFM
		based on two type of mixtures priors for the loadings: one
		relying on a degenerate component at zero and the other using a
		small variance normal distribution for the spike part of the
		mixture. It also implements additional functions to allow pre-
		processing procedures for the data and to fit the model for a
		large number of probesets or genes.
