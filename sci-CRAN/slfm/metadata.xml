		Fitting a Bayesian Sparse Latent Factor Model in Gene Expression
		Analysis // Set of tools to find coherent patterns in gene
		expression (microarray) data using a Bayesian Sparse Latent
		Factor Model (SLFM) DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-12454-4_15.
		Considerable effort has been put to build a fast and memory
		efficient package, which makes this proposal an interesting and
		computationally convenient alternative to study patterns of
		gene expressions exhibited in matrices. The package contains
		the implementation of two versions of the model based on
		different mixture priors for the loadings: one relies on a
		degenerate component at zero and the other uses a small
		variance normal distribution for the spike part of the mixture.
