		Some Nonparametric CUSUM Tests for Change-Point Detection in
		Possibly Multivariate Observations // Provides nonparametric
		CUSUM tests for detecting changes in possibly serially
		dependent univariate or multivariate observations. Offline
		tests sensitive to changes in the expectation, the variance,
		the covariance, the autocovariance, the distribution function,
		Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, Gini's mean difference, and the
		copula are provided, as well as a test for detecting changes in
		the distribution of independent block maxima (with
		environmental studies in mind). The package also contains a
		test sensitive to changes in the autocopula and a combined test
		of stationarity sensitive to changes in the distribution
		function and the autocopula. The latest addition is a
		sequential test based on empirical distribution functions that
		can be used for monitoring changes in the contemporary
		distribution of possibly serially dependent univariate or
		multivariate observations.
