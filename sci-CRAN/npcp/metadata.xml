		Some Nonparametric CUSUM Tests for Change-Point Detection in
		Possibly Multivariate Observations // Provides nonparametric
		CUSUM tests for detecting changes in possibly serially
		dependent univariate or low-dimensional multivariate
		observations. Retrospective tests sensitive to changes in the
		expectation, the variance, the covariance, the autocovariance,
		the distribution function, Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau,
		Gini's mean difference, and the copula are provided, as well as
		a test for detecting changes in the distribution of independent
		block maxima (with environmental studies in mind). The package
		also contains a test sensitive to changes in the autocopula and
		a combined test of stationarity sensitive to changes in the
		distribution function and the autocopula. The latest additions
		are an open-end sequential test based on the retrospective
		CUSUM statistic that can be used for monitoring changes in the
		mean of possibly serially dependent univariate observations, as
		well as closed-end and open-end sequential tests based on
		empirical distribution functions that can be used for
		monitoring changes in the contemporary distribution of possibly
		serially dependent univariate or low-dimensional multivariate
		observations.
