		Some Nonparametric CUSUM Tests for Change-Point Detection in
		Possibly Multivariate Observations // Provides nonparametric
		CUSUM tests for detecting changes in possibly serially
		dependent univariate or multivariate observations. Tests
		sensitive to changes in the expectation, the variance, the
		covariance, the autocovariance, the distribution function,
		Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, Gini's mean difference, and the
		copula are provided, as well as a test for detecting changes in
		the distribution of independent block maxima (with
		environmental studies in mind). The latest additions are a test
		sensitive to changes in the autocopula and a combined test of
		stationarity sensitive to changes in the distribution function
		and the autocopula.
