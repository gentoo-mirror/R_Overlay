		Superfast Likelihood Inference for Stationary Gaussian Time
		Series // Likelihood evaluations for stationary Gaussian time
		series are typically obtained via the Durbin-Levinson
		algorithm, which scales as O(n^2) in the number of time series
		observations.  This package provides a "superfast" O(n log^2 n)
		algorithm written in C++, crossing over with Durbin-Levinson
		around n = 300.  Efficient implementations of the score and
		Hessian functions are also provided, leading to superfast
		versions of inference algorithms such as Newton-Raphson and
		Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  The C++ code provides a Toeplitz
		matrix class packaged as a header-only library, to simplify
		low-level usage in other packages and outside of R.
