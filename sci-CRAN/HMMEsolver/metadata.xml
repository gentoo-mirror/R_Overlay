		A Fast Solver for Henderson Mixed Model Equation via Row
		Operations // Consider the linear mixed model with normal
		random effects. A typical method to solve Henderson's Mixed
		Model Equations (HMME) is recursive estimation of the fixed
		effects and random effects. We provide a fast, stable, and
		scalable solver to the HMME without computing matrix inverse.
		See Kim (2017) arXiv:1710.09663 for more details.
