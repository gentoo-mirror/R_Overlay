		Universal Clustering Analysis Platform // An interactive platform
		for clustering analysis and teaching based on the 'shiny' web
		application framework. Supports multiple popular clustering
		algorithms including k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN
		(Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise),
		PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids), GMM (Gaussian Mixture
		Model), and spectral clustering. Users can upload datasets or
		use built-in ones, visualize clustering results using
		dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component
		Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
		(t-SNE), evaluate clustering quality via silhouette plots, and
		explore method-specific visualizations and guides. For details
		on implemented methods, see: Reynolds (2009,
		ISBN:9781598296975) for GMM; Luxburg (2007)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-007-9033-z for spectral clustering.
