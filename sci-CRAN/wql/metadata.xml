		Exploring Water Quality Monitoring Data // Functions to assist in
		the processing and exploration of data from environmental
		monitoring programs. The package name stands for "water
		quality" and reflects the original focus on time series data
		for physical and chemical properties of water, as well as the
		biota. Intended for programs that sample approximately monthly,
		quarterly or annually at discrete stations, a feature of many
		legacy data sets. Most of the functions should be useful for
		analysis of similar-frequency time series regardless of the
		subject matter.
