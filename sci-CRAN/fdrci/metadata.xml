		Permutation-Based FDR Point and Confidence Interval Estimation //
		FDR functions for permutation-based estimators, including pi0
		as well as FDR confidence intervals. The confidence intervals
		account for dependencies between tests by the incorporation of
		an overdispersion parameter, which is estimated from the
		permuted data. Also included are options for an analog
		parametric approach.
