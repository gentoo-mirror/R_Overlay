		Comparing and Visualizing Differences Between Surveys // Easily
		analyze and visualize differences between samples (e.g.,
		benchmark comparisons, nonresponse comparisons in surveys) on
		three levels. The comparisons can be univariate, bivariate or
		multivariate. On univariate level the variables of interest of
		a survey and a comparison survey (i.e. benchmark) are compared,
		by calculating one of several difference measures (e.g.,
		relative difference in mean), and an average difference between
		the surveys. On bivariate level a function can calculate
		significant differences in correlations for the surveys. And on
		multivariate levels a function can calculate significant
		differences in model coefficients between the surveys of
		comparison. All of those differences can be easily plotted and
		outputted as a table. For more  detailed information on the
		methods and example use see Rohr, B., Silber, H.,  Felderer, B.
		(2024). Comparing the Accuracy of Univariate, Bivariate, and
		Multivariate Estimates across Probability and Non-Probability
		Surveys with Population Benchmarks  doi:10.31235/osf.io/n6ehf .
