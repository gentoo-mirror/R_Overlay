		Analysis and Visualization of Circular Data // Circumplex models,
		which organize constructs in a circle around two underlying
		dimensions, are popular for studying interpersonal functioning,
		mood/affect, and vocational preferences/environments. This
		package provides tools for analyzing and visualizing circular
		data, including scoring functions for relevant instruments and
		a generalization of the bootstrapped structural summary method
		from Zimmermann  Wright (2017) doi:10.1177/1073191115621795 and
		functions for creating publication-ready tables and figures
		from the results.
