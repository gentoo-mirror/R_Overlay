		Regression Standardization for Causal Inference // Contains more
		modern tools for causal inference using regression
		standardization. Four general classes of models are
		implemented; generalized linear models, conditional generalized
		estimating equation models, Cox proportional hazards models,
		and shared frailty gamma-Weibull models. Methodological details
		are described in Sjlander, A. (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s10654-016-0157-3. Also includes functionality for
		doubly robust estimation for generalized linear models in some
		special cases, and the ability to implement custom models.
