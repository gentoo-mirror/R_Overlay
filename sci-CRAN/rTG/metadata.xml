		Methods to Analyse Seasonal Radial Tree Growth Data // Methods
		for comparing different regression algorithms for describing
		the temporal dynamics of secondary tree growth (xylem and
		phloem). Users can compare the accuracy of the most common
		fitting methods usually used to analyse xylem and phloem data,
		i.e., Gompertz function and General Additive Models (GAMs); and
		an algorithm newly introduced to the field, i.e., Bayesian
		Regularised Neural Networks (brnn). The core function of the
		package is XPSgrowth(), while the results can be interpreted
		using implemented generic S3 methods, such as plot() and
		summary().
