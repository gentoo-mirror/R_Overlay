		L1-Penalized Multinomial Regression with Statistical Inference //
		We aim for fitting a multinomial regression model with Lasso
		penalty and doing statistical inference (calculating confidence
		intervals of coefficients and p-values for individual
		variables). It implements 1) the coordinate descent algorithm
		to fit an l1-penalized multinomial regression model
		(parameterized with a reference level); 2) the debiasing
		approach to obtain the inference results, which is described in
		"Tian, Y., Rusinek, H., Masurkar, A. V.,  Feng, Y. (2024).
		L1Penalized Multinomial Regression: Estimation, Inference, and
		Prediction, With an Application to Risk Factor Identification
		for Different Dementia Subtypes. Statistics in Medicine,
		43(30), 5711-5747."
