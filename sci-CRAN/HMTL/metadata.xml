		Heterogeneous Multi-Task Feature Learning // The heterogeneous
		multi-task feature learning is a data integration method to
		conduct joint feature selection across multiple related data
		sets with different distributions. The algorithm can combine
		different types of learning tasks, including linear regression,
		Huber regression, adaptive Huber, and logistic regression. The
		modified version of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is
		produced to measure the model performance. Package is based on
		Yuan Zhong, Wei Xu, and Xin Gao (2022)
