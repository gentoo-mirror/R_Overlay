		a Global Weighted Model for Disease Ontology Enrichment Analysis
		// To implement disease ontology (DO) enrichment analysis, this
		package is designed and presents a double weighted model based
		on the latest annotations of the human genome with DO terms, by
		integrating the DO graph topology on a global scale. This
		package exhibits high accuracy that it can identify more
		specific DO terms, which alleviates the over enriched problem.
		The package includes various statistical models and
		visualization schemes for discovering the associations between
		genes and diseases from biological big data.
