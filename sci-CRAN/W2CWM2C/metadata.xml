		A Graphical Tool for Wavelet (Cross) Correlation and Wavelet
		Multiple (Cross) Correlation Analysis // Set of functions that
		improves the graphical presentations of the functions
		'wave.correlation' and 'spin.correlation' (waveslim package,
		Whitcher 2012) and the 'wave.multiple.correlation' and
		'wave.multiple.cross.correlation' (wavemulcor package,
		Fernandez-Macho 2012b). The plot outputs (heatmaps) can be
		displayed in the screen or can be saved as PNG or JPG images or
		as PDF or EPS formats. The W2CWM2C package also helps to handle
		the (input data) multivariate time series easily as a list of N
		elements (times series) and provides a multivariate data set
		(dataexample) to exemplify its use. A description of the
		package was published in Computing in Science  Engineering
		(Volume:16, Issue: 6) on Sep. 09, 2014,
		doi:10.1109/MCSE.2014.96.
