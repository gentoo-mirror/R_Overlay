		A Graphical Tool for Wavelet (Cross) Correlation and Wavelet
		Multiple (Cross) Correlation Analysis // Set of functions that
		improves the graphical presentations of the functions:
		wave.correlation and spin.correlation (waveslim package,
		Whitcher 2012) and the wave.multiple.correlation and
		wave.multiple.cross.correlation (wavemulcor package, Fernandez-
		Macho 2012b). The plot outputs (heatmaps) can be displayed in
		the screen or can be saved as PNG or JPG images or as PDF or
		EPS formats. The W2CWM2C package also helps to handle the
		(input data) multivariate time series easily as a list of N
		elements (times series) and provides a multivariate data set
		(dataexample) to exemplify its use. A description of the
		package was published in a scientific paper: Polanco-Martinez
		and Fernandez-Macho (2014), doi:10.1109/MCSE.2014.96.
