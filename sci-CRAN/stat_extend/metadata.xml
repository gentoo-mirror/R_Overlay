		Highest Density Regions and Other Functions of Distributions //
		Highest Density Regions are the smallest set in the support of
		a probability distribution with the specified coverage
		probability. 'HDRs' may contain disjoint intervals, but can be
		calculated efficiently using iterative methods. One can
		similarly construct optimal (i.e., shortest) confidence
		intervals for some basic inferential problems, including for
		population means, variances, or proportion parameters.
