		Bayesian Restricted Mean Survival Time for Cluster Effect // The
		parametric Bayes analysis for the restricted mean survival time
		(RMST) with cluster effect, as described in Hanada and Kojima
		(2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.06071. Bayes estimation with
		random-effect and frailty-effect can be applied to several
		parametric models useful in survival time analysis. The RMST
		under these parametric models can be computed from the obtained
		posterior samples.
