		Synthetic Control Method to Forecast Series // Not a new method
		implementation. Usage of the Synthetic Control Method, see
		Abadie et al. (2011) doi:10.18637/jss.v042.i13, as an ad-hoc
		approach to forecast series with panel in a specific context.
		The context being: There are units in different stages of a
		certain journey, there the assumption that the units behavior
		throw out the journey are similar is valid and there are not
		enough data to use traditional forecasting methods. For a usage
		example see the package home page documentation.
