		Bayesian Hierarchical Poisson Models for Multiple Grouped
		Outcomes with Clustering // Bayesian hierarchical methods for
		the detection of differences in rates of related outcomes for
		multiple treatments for clustered observations. Theoretical
		background for the models is given in Carragher (2017)
		https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.736866. The
		models in this package are extensions for multiple treatments
		and clusters. This software was developed for the Precision
		Drug Theraputics: Risk Prediction in Pharmacoepidemiology
		project as part of a Rutherford Fund Fellowship at Health Data
		Research (UK), Medical Research Council (UK) award reference
		MR/S003967/1 (https://gtr.ukri.org/). Principal Investigator:
		Raymond Carragher.
