		Simulation-Based Power Estimation (MSPE) for Nonlinear SEM //
		Model-implied simulation-based power estimation (MSPE) for
		nonlinear (and linear) SEM, path analysis and regression
		analysis. A theoretical framework is used to approximate the
		relation between power and sample size for given type I error
		rates and effect sizes. The package offers an adaptive search
		algorithm to find the optimal N for given effect sizes and type
		I error rates. Plots can be used to visualize the power
		relation to N for different parameters of interest (POI).
		Theoretical justifications are given in Irmer et al. (2024a)
		doi:10.31219/osf.io/pe5bj and detailed description are given in
		Irmer et al. (2024b).
