		Bayesian Inference of Landscape Occupancy from Presence-Only Data
		// Natural history museums and herbaria collectively hold
		hundreds of millions of zoological, botanical, and
		paleontological specimens. These collections serve as the
		foundation for understanding the distribution of life on Earth
		and the basis for addressing loss of biodiversity, emerging
		diseases, and other pressing global problems as well as
		important question in ecology and evolution. One of the short
		comings of these kind of data is that the lack of evidence of
		the presence of a species in a certain region does not mean the
		species is truly absent there. Likewise, specimens are often
		misidentified, and therefore the report of a species in a
		locality is not always evidence that a viable population occurs
		there. The goal of this project is to develop a method which
		could be used to estimate the probability of presence of a
		species in a certain study region based on certain sampling
		effort and presence reports.
