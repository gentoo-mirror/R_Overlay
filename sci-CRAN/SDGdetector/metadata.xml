		Detecting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Text // A tool
		for identifying 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
		associated 169 targets in text, as described in Yingjie Li
		(2022) https://github.com/Yingjie4Science/SDGdetector/blob/main
		/paper/paper.pdf . It uses natural language processing to
		transform unstructured text into normalized and structured data
		suitable for analysis and visualization. It thus enables a
		unique way to monitor individuals' and organizations'
		commitments and efforts towards advancing SDGs and targets.
