		Discriminant Analysis Methods by Weight Mahalanobis Distance and
		bayes // Distance discriminant analysis method is one of
		classification methods according to multiindex performance
		parameters.However,the traditional Mahalanobis distance
		discriminant method treats with the importance of all
		parameters equally,and exaggerates the role of parameters which
		changes a little.The weighted Mahalanobis distance is used in
		discriminant analysis method to distinguish the importance of
		each parameter.In the concrete application,firstly based on the
		principal component analysis scheme,a new group of parameters
		and their corresponding percent contributions of the parameters
		are calculated ,and the weighted matrix is regarded as the
		diagonal matrix of the contributions rates.Setting data to
		standardization,then the weighted Mahalanobis distance can be
		calculated.Besides the methods metioned above,bayes method is
		also given.
