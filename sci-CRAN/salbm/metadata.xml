		Sensitivity Analysis for Binary Missing Data // In a clinical
		trial with repeated measures designs, outcomes are often taken
		from subjects at fixed time-points.  The focus of the trial may
		be to compare the mean outcome in two or more groups at some
		pre-specified time after enrollment. In the presence of missing
		data auxiliary assumptions are necessary to perform such
		comparisons.  One commonly employed assumption is the missing
		at random assumption (MAR). The 'salbm' package allows the user
		to perform a (parameterized) sensitivity analysis of this
		assumption where the outcome of interest is binary (coded as 0,
		1, or NA).  In particular it can be used to examine the
		sensitivity of tests in the difference in outcomes to
		violations of the MAR assumption. See the paper Daniel O.
		Scharfstein, Jaron J. R. Lee, Aidan McDermott, Aimee Campbell,
		Edward Nunes, Abigail G. Matthews, Ilya Shpitser "Markov-
		Restricted Analysis of Randomized Trials with Non-Monotone
		Missing Binary Outcomes: Sensitivity Analysis and
		Identification Results" (2021) arXiv:2105.08868.
