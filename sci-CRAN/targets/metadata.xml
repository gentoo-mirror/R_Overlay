		Dynamic Function-Oriented 'Make'-Like Declarative Workflows // As
		a pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R, the
		'targets' package brings together function-oriented programming
		and 'Make'-like declarative workflows. It analyzes the
		dependency relationships among the tasks of a workflow, skips
		steps that are already up to date, runs the necessary
		computation with optional parallel workers, abstracts files as
		R objects, and provides tangible evidence that the results
		match the underlying code and data. The methodology in this
		package borrows from GNU 'Make' (2015, ISBN:978-9881443519) and
		'drake' (2018, doi:10.21105/joss.00550).
