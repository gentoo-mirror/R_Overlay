		Dynamic Function-Oriented 'Make'-Like Declarative Pipelines //
		Pipeline tools coordinate the pieces of computationally
		demanding analysis projects. The 'targets' package is a
		'Make'-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science in R.
		The package skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up
		to date, orchestrates the necessary computation with implicit
		parallel computing, and abstracts files as R objects. If all
		the current output matches the current upstream code and data,
		then the whole pipeline is up to date, and the results are more
		trustworthy than otherwise. The methodology in this package
		borrows from GNU 'Make' (2015, ISBN:978-9881443519) and 'drake'
		(2018, doi:10.21105/joss.00550).
