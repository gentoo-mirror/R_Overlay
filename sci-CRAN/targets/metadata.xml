		Dynamic Function-Oriented 'Make'-Like Declarative Pipelines // A
		pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R, the
		'targets' package brings function-oriented programming to
		'Make'-like declarative pipelines. 'targets' orchestrates a
		pipeline as a graph of dependencies, skips steps that are
		already up to date, runs the necessary computation with
		optional parallel workers, abstracts files as R objects, and
		provides tangible evidence that the results are reproducible
		given the underlying code and data. The methodology in this
		package borrows from GNU 'Make' (2015, ISBN:978-9881443519) and
		'drake' (2018, doi:10.21105/joss.00550).
