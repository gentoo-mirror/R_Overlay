		Population Life Course Exposure to Health Effects Modeling //
		Functions, data and user interfaces for performing
		Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic('PBPK') Modeling, In-
		vitro to In-vivo Extrapolation ('IVIVE') and exposure
		estimation. Also contains user interfaces to run models from
		the 'httk' package. Taken together these provide an easy to use
		and powerful modeling tool that can be used for all steps along
		the source-to-outcome continuum.All the analysis tools in the
		package are run as interactive applications. Check vignettes
		and package help for more information. Refer to the manuscript
		'Population Life-course exposure to health effects model
		(PLETHEM): An R package for PBPK modeling' doi:
		10.1016/j.comtox.2019.100115 for more information on the models
		and algorithms used in the package. More information on PBPK
		modeling itself can be found in the book 'Physiologically Based
		Pharmacokinetic Modeling: Science and Applications' by Reddy et
		al doi:10.1002/0471478768.
