		Classical Model Fitting of Adsorption Isotherms // Provides tools
		for classical parameter estimation of adsorption isotherm
		models, including both linear and nonlinear forms of the
		Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin isotherms. This package allows
		users to fit these models to experimental data, providing
		parameter estimates along with fit statistics such as Akaike
		Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion
		(BIC). Error metrics are computed to evaluate model
		performance, and the package produces model fit plots with
		bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, it
		generates residual plots for diagnostic assessment of the
		models. Researchers and engineers in material science,
		environmental engineering, and chemical engineering can
		rigorously analyze adsorption behavior in their systems using
		this straightforward, non-Bayesian approach. For more details,
		see Harding (1907) doi:10.2307/2987516.
