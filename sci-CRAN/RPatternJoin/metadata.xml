		String Similarity Joins for Hamming and Levenshtein Distances //
		This project is a tool for words edit similarity joins (a.k.a.
		all-pairs similarity search) under small ( 3) edit distance
		constraints. It works for Levenshtein/Hamming distances and
		words from any alphabet. The software was originally developed
		for joining amino-acid/nucleotide sequences from Adaptive
		Immune Repertoires, where the number of words is relatively
		large (10^5-10^6) and the average length of words is relatively
		small (10-100).
