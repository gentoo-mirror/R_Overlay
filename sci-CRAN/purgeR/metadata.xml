		Inbreeding-Purging Estimation in Pedigreed Populations //
		Inbreeding-purging analysis of pedigreed populations, including
		the computation of the inbreeding coefficient, partial,
		ancestral and purged inbreeding coefficients, and measures of
		the opportunity of purging related to the individual reduction
		of inbreeding load. In addition, functions to calculate the
		effective population size and other parameters relevant to
		population genetics are included. See Lpez-Cortegano E. (2021)
