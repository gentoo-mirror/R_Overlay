		Graphical Toolbox for Clustering and Classification of Data
		Frames // Graphical toolbox for clustering and classification
		of data frames. It proposes a graphical interface to process
		clustering and classification methods on features data-frames,
		and to view initial data as well as resulted cluster or
		classes. According to the level of available labels, different
		approaches are proposed: unsupervised clustering, semi-
		supervised clustering and supervised classification. To assess
		the processed clusters or classes, the toolbox can import and
		show some supplementary data formats: either profile/time
		series, or images. These added information can help the expert
		to label clusters (clustering), or to constrain data frame rows
		(semi-supervised clustering), using Constrained spectral
		embedding algorithm by Wacquet et al. (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.patrec.2013.02.003 and the methodology provided
		by Wacquet et al. (2013) doi:10.1007/978-3-642-35638-4_21.
