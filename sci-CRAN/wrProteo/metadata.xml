		Proteomics Data Analysis Functions // Data analysis of proteomics
		experiments by mass spectrometry is supported by this
		collection of functions mostly dedicated to the analysis of
		(bottom-up) quantitative (XIC) data. Fasta-formatted proteomes
		(eg from Uniprot) can be read with automatic parsing and
		multiple annotation types (like species origin, abbreviated
		gene names, etc) extracted. Quantitative proteomics
		measurements frequently contain multiple NA values, due to
		physical absence of given peptides in some samples, limitations
		in sensitivity or other reasons. The functions provided here
		help to inspect graphically the data to investigate the nature
		of NA-values via their respective replicate measurements and to
		help/confirm the choice of NA-replacement by low random values.
		Dedicated filtering and statistical testing using the framework
		of package 'limma' can be run, enhanced by multiple rounds of
		NA-replacements to provide robustness towards rare stochastic
		events. Multi-species samples, as frequently used in benchmark-
		tests, can be run with special options consideration separating
		the data into sub-groups during normalization and testing.
		Subsequently, ROC curves can be constructed to compare multiple
		analysis approaches.
