		Fast Polygon to Raster Conversion // Provides a drop-in
		replacement for rasterize() from the 'raster' package that
		takes polygon vector or data frame objects, and is much faster.
		There is support for the main options provided by the
		rasterize() function, including setting the field used and
		background value, and options for aggregating multi-layer
		rasters. Uses the scan line algorithm attributed to Wylie et
		al. (1967) doi:10.1145/1465611.1465619.
