		The Computing of Monotonic Spline Bases and Constrained Least-
		Squares Estimates // Providing C implementation for the
		computing of monotonic spline bases, including M-splines,
		I-splines, and C-splines, denoted by MIC splines. The
		definitions of the spline bases are described in Meyer (2008)
		doi: 10.1214/08-AOAS167. The package also provides the
		computing of constrained least-squares estimates when a subset
		of or all of the regression coefficients are constrained to be
		non-negative.
