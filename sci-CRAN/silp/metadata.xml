		Conditional Process Analysis (CPA) via Structural Equation
		Modeling (SEM) Approach // Provides Reliability-Adjusted
		Product Indicator (RAPI) method to estimate effects among
		latent variables, thus allowing for more precise definition and
		analysis of mediation and moderation models. Our simulation
		studies reveal that while 'silp' may exhibit instability with
		smaller sample sizes and lower reliability scores (e.g., N =
		100, omega = 0.7), implementing nearest positive definite
		matrix correction and bootstrap confidence interval estimation
		can significantly ameliorate this volatility. When these
		adjustments are applied, 'silp' achieves estimations akin in
		quality to those derived from latent moderated structural
		equations (LMS). In conclusion, the 'silp' package is a
		valuable tool for researchers seeking to explore complex
		relational structures between variables without resorting to
		commercial software. Hsiao et
