		A Method for 'Connecting The Dots' in Weighted Graphs // A method
		for pattern discovery in weighted graphs as outlined in
		Thistlethwaite et al. (2021) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008550.
		Two use cases are achieved: 1) Given a weighted graph and a
		subset of its nodes, do the nodes show significant
		connectedness? 2) Given a weighted graph and two subsets of its
		nodes, are the subsets close neighbors or distant?
