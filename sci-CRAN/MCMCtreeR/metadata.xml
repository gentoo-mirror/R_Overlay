		Prepare MCMCtree Analyses and Plot Bayesian Divergence Time
		Analyses Estimates on Trees // Provides functions to prepare
		time priors for 'MCMCtree' analyses in the 'PAML' software from
		Yang (2007)doi:10.1093/molbev/msm088 and plot time-scaled
		phylogenies from any Bayesian divergence time analysis. Most
		time-calibrated node prior distributions require user-specified
		parameters. The package provides functions to refine these
		parameters, so that the resulting prior distributions
		accurately reflect confidence in known, usually fossil, time
		information. These functions also enable users to visualise
		distributions and write 'MCMCtree' ready input files.
		Additionally, the package supplies flexible functions to
		visualise age uncertainty on a plotted tree with using node
		bars, using branch widths proportional to the age uncertainty,
		or by plotting the full posterior distributions on nodes. Time-
		scaled phylogenetic plots can be visualised with absolute and
		geological timescales . All plotting functions are applicable
		with output from any Bayesian software, not just 'MCMCtree'.
