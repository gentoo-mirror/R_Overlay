		Empirical Bayes Variable Selection via ICM/M Algorithm //
		Empirical Bayes variable selection via ICM/M algorithm for
		normal, binary logistic, and Cox's regression. The basic
		problem is to fit high-dimensional regression which sparse
		coefficients. This package allows incorporating the Ising prior
		to capture structure of predictors in the modeling process.
		More information can be found in the papers listed in the URL
