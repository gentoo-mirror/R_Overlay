		Empirical Bayes Variable Selection via ICM/M Algorithm // Carries
		out empirical Bayes variable selection via ICM/M algorithm. The
		basic problem is to fit high-dimensional regression which most
		coefficients are assumed to be zero. This package allows
		incorporating the Ising prior to capture structure of
		predictors in the modeling process. The current version of this
		package can handle the normal, binary logistic, and Cox's
		regression (Pungpapong et. al. (2015) doi:10.1214/15-EJS1034,
		Pungpapong et. al. (2017) arXiv:1707.08298).
