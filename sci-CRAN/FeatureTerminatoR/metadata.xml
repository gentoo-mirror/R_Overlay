		Feature Selection Engine to Remove Features with Minimal
		Predictive Power // The aim is to take in data.frame inputs and
		utilises methods, such as recursive feature engineering, to
		enable the features to be removed. What this does differently
		from the other packages, is that it gives you the choice to
		remove the variables manually, or it automated this process.
		Feature selection is a concept in machine learning, and
		statistical pipelines, whereby unimportant, or less predictive
		variables are eliminated from the analysis, see Boughaci (2018)
