		Time Series Forecasting Using GRNN // A general regression neural
		network (GRNN) is a variant of a Radial Basis Function Network
		characterized by a fast single-pass learning. 'tsfgrnn' allows
		you to forecast time series using a GRNN model Francisco
		Martinez et al. (2019) doi:10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_17 and
		Weizhong Yan (2012) doi:10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2198074. When the
		forecasting horizon is higher than 1, two multi-step ahead
		forecasting strategies can be used. The model built is
		autoregressive, that is, it is only based on the observations
		of the time series. You can consult and plot how the prediction
		was done. It is also possible to assess the forecasting
		accuracy of the model using rolling origin evaluation.
