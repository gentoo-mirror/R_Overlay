		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Multivariate linear mixed-
		effect model solver for multiple random effects allowing the
		specification of variance covariance structures. ML/REML
		estimates are obtained using the Direct-Inversion Newton-
		Raphson (NR), Direct-Inversion Average Information (AI),
		Expectation-Maximization (EM), or Efficient Mixed Model
		Association (EMMA) algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction
		and genome wide association studies (GWAS) to include additive,
		dominance and epistatic relationship structures or other
		covariance structures in R, but also functional as a regular
		mixed model program. Multivariate models (multiple responses)
		can be fitted currently with NR, AI and EMMA algorithms
		allowing multiple random effects as well. Covariance structures
		for the residual component are no longer supported.
