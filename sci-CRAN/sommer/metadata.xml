		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Structural multivariate-
		univariate linear mixed model solver for multiple random
		effects and estimation of unknown variance-covariance
		structures (i.e. heterogeneous and unstructured variance
		models) (Covarrubias-Pazaran, 2016
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0156744; Maier et al., 2015
		doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.12.006). ML/REML estimates can be
		obtained using the Direct-Inversion Newton-Raphson and Direct-
		Inversion Average Information algorithms. Designed for genomic
		prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS),
		particularly focused in the p  n problem (more coefficients
		than observations) to include multiple known relationship
		matrices and estimate complex unknown covariance structures.
		Spatial models can be fitted using the two-dimensional spline
		functionality in sommer.
