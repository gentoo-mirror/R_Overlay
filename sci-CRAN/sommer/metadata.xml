		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Structural multivariate-
		univariate linear mixed model solver for estimation of multiple
		random effects with unknown variance-covariance structures
		(e.g., heterogeneous and unstructured) and known covariance
		among levels of random effects (e.g., pedigree and genomic
		relationship matrices) (Covarrubias-Pazaran, 2016
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0156744; Maier et al., 2015
		doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.12.006). REML estimates can be obtained
		using the Direct-Inversion Newton-Raphson and Direct-Inversion
		Average Information algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction
		and genome wide association studies (GWAS), particularly
		focused in the p  n problem (more coefficients to estimate than
		observations). Spatial models can also be fitted using the two-
		dimensional spline functionality available in sommer.
