		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Structural multivariate-
		univariate linear mixed model solver for multiple random
		effects allowing the specification of variance-covariance
		structures for random effects and allowing the fit of
		heterogeneous variance models (Covarrubias-Pazaran, 2016
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0156744; Maier et al., 2015
		doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.12.006). ML/REML estimates can be
		obtained using the Direct-Inversion Newton-Raphson, and
		Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithms. Designed for
		genomic prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS),
		particularly focused in the p  n problem (more coefficients
		than observations) to include multiple relationship matrices or
		other covariance structures.
