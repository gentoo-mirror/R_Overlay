		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Multivariate linear mixed
		model solver for estimation of heterogeneous variances and
		specification of variance covariance structures. Maximum and
		Restricted Maximum Likelihood (ML/REML) estimates can be
		obtained using the Direct-Inversion Newton-Raphson (NR),
		Direct-Inversion Average Information (AI), MME-based
		Expectation-Maximization (EM), and Efficient Mixed Model
		Association (EMMA) algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction
		and genome wide association studies (GWAS) to include additive,
		dominance and epistatic relationship structures or other
		covariance structures in R, but also functional as a regular
		multivariate mixed model software. Multivariate models
		(multiple responses) can be fitted currently with NR, AI and
		EMMA algorithms.
