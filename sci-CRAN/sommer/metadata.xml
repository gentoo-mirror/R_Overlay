		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Structural multivariate-
		univariate linear mixed model solver for multiple random
		effects allowing the specification of variance-covariance
		structures for random effects and allowing the fit of
		heterogeneous variance models. ML/REML estimates can be
		obtained using the Direct-Inversion Newton-Raphson, and
		Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithms. Designed for
		genomic prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS)
		to include additive, dominance and epistatic relationship
		structures or other covariance structures, but also functional
		as a regular mixed model program.
