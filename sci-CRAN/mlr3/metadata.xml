		Machine Learning in R - Next Generation // Efficient, object-
		oriented programming on the building blocks of machine
		learning. Provides 'R6' objects for tasks, learners,
		resamplings, and measures. The package is geared towards
		scalability and larger datasets by supporting parallelization
		and out-of-memory data-backends like databases. While 'mlr3'
		focuses on the core computational operations, add-on packages
		provide additional functionality.
