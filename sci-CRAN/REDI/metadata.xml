		Robust Exponential Decreasing Index // Implementation of the
		Robust Exponential Decreasing Index (REDI), proposed in the
		article by Issa Moussa, Arthur Leroy et al. (2019) https://bmjo
		pensem.bmj.com/content/bmjosem/5/1/e000573.full.pdf. The REDI
		represents a measure of cumulated workload, robust to missing
		data, providing control of the decreasing influence of workload
		over time. Various functions are provided to format data,
		compute REDI, and visualise results in a simple and convenient
		way.
