		Fit Data to Any Conic Section // Fit data to an ellipse,
		hyperbola, or parabola. Bootstrapping is available when needed.
		The conic curve can be rotated through an  arbitrary angle and
		the fit will still succeed. Helper functions are  provided to
		convert generator coefficients from one style to another,
		generate test data sets, rotate conic section parameters, and
		so on. References include Nikolai Chernov (2014) "Fitting
		ellipses, circles, and lines by  least squares"
