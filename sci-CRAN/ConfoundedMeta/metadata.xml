		Sensitivity Analyses for Unmeasured Confounding in Meta-Analyses
		// Conducts sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding in
		random-effects meta-analysis per Mathur  VanderWeele (in
		preparation). Given output from a random-effects meta-analysis
		with a relative risk outcome, computes point estimates and
		inference for: (1) the proportion of studies with true causal
		effect sizes more extreme than a specified threshold of
		scientific significance; and (2) the minimum bias factor and
		confounding strength required to reduce to less than a
		specified threshold the proportion of studies with true effect
		sizes of scientifically significant size. Creates plots and
		tables for visualizing these metrics across a range of bias
		values.
