		Linear Group Fixed Effects // Transforms away factors with many
		levels prior to doing an OLS. Useful for estimating linear
		models with multiple group fixed effects, and for estimating
		linear models which uses factors with many levels as pure
		control variables. See Gaure (2013)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.03.024 Includes support for
		instrumental variables, conditional F statistics for weak
		instruments, robust and multi-way clustered standard errors, as
		well as limited mobility bias correction (Gaure 2014
		doi:10.1002/sta4.68). WARNING: This package is NOT under active
		development anymore, no further improvements are to be
		expected, and the package is at risk of being removed from
		CRAN.
