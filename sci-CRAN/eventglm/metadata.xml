		Regression Models for Event History Outcomes // A user friendly,
		easy to understand way of doing event history regression for
		marginal estimands of interest, including the cumulative
		incidence and the restricted mean survival, using the pseudo
		observation framework for estimation. For a review of the
		methodology, see Andersen and Pohar Perme (2010)
		doi:10.1177/0962280209105020. The interface uses the well known
		formulation of a generalized linear model and allows for
		features including plotting of residuals, the use of sampling
		weights, and corrected variance estimation.
