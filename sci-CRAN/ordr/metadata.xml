		A 'tidyverse' Extension for Ordinations and Biplots // Ordination
		comprises several multivariate exploratory and explanatory
		techniques with theoretical foundations in geometric data
		analysis; see Podani (2000, ISBN:90-5782-067-6) for techniques
		and applications and Le Roux  Rouanet (2005)
		doi:10.1007/1-4020-2236-0 for foundations. Greenacre (2010,
		ISBN:978-84-923846) shows how the most established of these,
		including principal components analysis, correspondence
		analysis, multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, and
		discriminant analysis, rely on eigen-decompositions or singular
		value decompositions of pre-processed numeric matrix data.
		These decompositions give rise to a set of shared coordinates
		along which the row and column elements can be measured. The
		overlay of their scatterplots on these axes, introduced by
		Gabriel (1971) doi:10.1093/biomet/58.3.453, is called a biplot.
		'ordr' provides inspection, extraction, manipulation, and
		visualization tools for several popular ordination classes
		supported by a set of recovery methods. It is inspired by and
		designed to integrate into 'tidyverse' workflows provided by
		Wickham et al (2019) doi:10.21105/joss.01686.
