		Learn Text 'Embeddings' with 'Starspace' // Wraps the 'StarSpace'
		library https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace allowing
		users to calculate word, sentence, article, document, webpage,
		link and entity 'embeddings'. By using the 'embeddings', you
		can perform text based multi-label classification, find
		similarities between texts and categories, do collaborative-
		filtering based recommendation as well as content-based
		recommendation, find out relations between entities, calculate
		graph 'embeddings' as well as perform semi-supervised learning
		and multi-task learning on plain text. The techniques are
		explained in detail in the paper: 'StarSpace: Embed All The
		Things!' by Wu et al. (2017), available at arXiv:1709.03856.
