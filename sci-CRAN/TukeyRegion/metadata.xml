		Tukey Region and Median // Tukey regions are polytopes in the
		Euclidean space, viz. upper-level sets of the Tukey depth
		function on given data. The bordering hyperplanes of a Tukey
		region are computed as well as its vertices, facets, centroid,
		and volume. In addition, the Tukey median set, which is the
		non-empty Tukey region having highest depth level, and its
		barycenter (= Tukey median) are calculated. Tukey regions are
		visualized in dimension two and three. For details see Liu,
		Mosler, and Mozharovskyi (2017) arXiv:1412.5122.
