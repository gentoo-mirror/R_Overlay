		Clay Stacking Rings Found in Miletus (Data) // Stacking rings are
		tools used to stack pottery in a Kiln. A relatively large group
		of stacking rings was found in the area of the sanctuary of
		Dionysos in Miletus in the 1970s. Measurements and additional
		info is gathered in this package and made available for use by
		other researchers. The data along with its archaeological
		context and analysis has been published in "Archologischer
		Anzeiger" (2020/1, doi:10.34780/aa.v0i1.1014).
