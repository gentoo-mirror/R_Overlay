		Quality Control and Outlier Identification in Bulk for
		Multicenter Trials // Multicenter randomized trials involve the
		collection and analysis of data from numerous study
		participants across multiple sites. Outliers may be present. To
		identify outliers, this package examines data at the individual
		level (univariate and multivariate) and site-level (with and
		without covariate adjustment). Methods are outlined in further
		detail in Rigdon et al (to appear).
