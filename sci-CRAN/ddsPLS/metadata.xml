		Data-Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares Robust to Missing
		Samples for Mono and Multi-Block Data Sets // Allows to build
		Multi-Data-Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares models. Multi-
		blocks with high-dimensional settings are particularly sensible
		to this. It comes with visualization functions and uses 'Rcpp'
		functions for fast computations and 'doParallel' to parallelize
		cross-validation. This is based on H Lorenzo, J Saracco, R
		Thiebaut (2019) arXiv:1901.04380. Many applications have been
		successfully realized. See https://hadrienlorenzo.netlify.com/
		for more information, documentation and examples.
