		Data-Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares // Allows to build Data-
		Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares models with high-
		dimensional settings. Number of components and regularization
		coefficients are automatically set. It comes with visualization
		functions and uses 'Rcpp' functions for fast computations and
		'doParallel' to parallelize bootstrap operations. An applet has
		been developed to apply this procedure. This is based on H
		Lorenzo, O Cloarec, R Thiebaut, J Saracco (2021)
