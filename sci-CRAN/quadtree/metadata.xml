		Region Quadtrees for Spatial Data // Provides functionality for
		working with raster-like quadtrees (also called region
		quadtrees), which allow for variable-sized cells. The package
		allows for flexibility in the quadtree creation process.
		Several functions defining how to split and aggregate cells are
		provided, and custom functions can be written for both of these
		processes. In addition, quadtrees can be created using other
		quadtrees as templates, so that the new quadtree's structure is
		identical to the template quadtree. The package also includes
		functionality for modifying quadtrees, querying values, saving
		quadtrees to a file, and calculating least-cost paths using the
		quadtree as a resistance surface.
