		Detecting Damaged Cells in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data //
		Detects and filters damaged cells in single-cell RNA sequencing
		(scRNA-seq) data using a novel approach inspired by
		'DoubletFinder'. Damage is detected by measuring the extent to
		which cells deviate from artificially damaged profiles of
		themselves, simulated through the probabilistic escape of
		cytoplasmic RNA. As output, a damage score ranging from 0 to 1
		is given for each cell providing an intuitive scale for
		filtering that is standardised across cell types, samples, and
		experiments.
