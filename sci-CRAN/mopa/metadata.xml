		Species Distribution MOdeling with Pseudo-Absences // Tools for
		transferable species distribution modeling and pseudo-absence
		data generation allowing the straightforward design of
		relatively complex experiments with multiple factors affecting
		the uncertainty (variability) of SDM outputs (pseudo-absence
		sample, climate projection, modeling algorithm, etc.), and the
		quantification of the contribution of different factors to the
		final variability following the method described in Deque el
		al. (2010) doi:10.1007/s00382-011-1053-x. Multiple methods for
		pseudo-absence data generation can be applied, including the
		novel Three-step method as described in Iturbide et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.05.018. Additionally, a function
		for niche overlap calculation is provided, considering the
		metrics described in Warren et al. (2008)
		10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x and in Pianka (1973)
		10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000413.
