		Value Change Dump to Data Frame // Provides the 'vcd2df'
		function, which loads a IEEE 1364-1995/2001 VCD (.vcd) file,
		specified as a parameter of type string containing exactly a
		file path, and returns an R dataframe containing values over
		time. A VCD file captures the register values at discrete
		timepoints from a simulated trace of execution of a hardware
		design in Verilog or VHDL. The returned dataframe contains a
		row for each register, by name, and a column for each time
		point, specified VCD-style using octothorpe-prefixed multiples
		of the timescale as strings. The only non-trivial
		implementation details are that (1) VCD 'x' and 'z' non-
		numerical values are encoded as negative value -1 (as otherwise
		all bit values are positive) and (2) registers with repeated
		names in distinct modules are ignored, rather than duplicated,
		as we anticipate these registers to have the same values. Read
		more in arXiv preprint: 'vcd2df' -- Leveraging Data Science
