		Minimax and Minimax Projection Designs // Provides two main
		functions: mMcPSO() and miniMaxPro(), which generates minimax
		designs and minimax projection designs using a hybrid
		clustering - particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. These
		designs can be used in a variety of settings, e.g., as space-
		filling designs for computer experiments or sensor allocation
		designs. A detailed description of the two designs and the
		employed algorithms can be found in Mak and Joseph (2017)
