		Khmaladze Martingale Transformation Goodness-of-Fit Test //
		Consider a goodness-of-fit(GOF) problem of testing whether a
		random sample comes from one sample location-scale model where
		location and scale parameters are unknown. It is well known
		that Khmaladze martingale transformation method provides
		asymptotic distribution free test for the GOF problem. This
		package contains one function: KhmaladzeTrans(). In this
		version, KhmaladzeTrans() provides test statistic and critical
		value of GOF test for normal, Cauchy, logistic, Gamma, Weibull,
		Gumbel, and Rayleigh distributions.
