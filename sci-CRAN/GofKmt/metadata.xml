		Khmaladze Martingale Transformation Goodness-of-Fit Test //
		Consider a goodness-of-fit (GOF) problem of testing whether a
		random sample comes from one sample location-scale model where
		location and scale parameters are unknown. It is well known
		that Khmaladze martingale transformation method - which was
		proposed by Khmaladze (1981) DOI:10.1137/1126027 - provides
		asymptotic distribution free test for the GOF problem. This
		package contains one function: KhmaladzeTrans(). In this
		version, KhmaladzeTrans() provides test statistic and critical
		value of GOF test for normal, Cauchy, and logistic
		distributions. This package used the main algorithm proposed by
		Kim (2020) DOI:10.1007/s00180-020-00971-7 and tests for other
		distributions will be available at the later version.
