		R Client for 'Via Foundry' API // 'Via Foundry' API provides
		streamlined tools for interacting with and extracting data from
		structured responses, particularly for use cases involving
		hierarchical data from Foundry's API. It includes functions to
		fetch and parse process-level and file-level metadata, allowing
		users to efficiently query and manipulate nested data
		structures. Key features include the ability to list all unique
		process names, retrieve file metadata for specific or all
		processes, and dynamically load or download files based on
		their type. With built-in support for handling various file
		formats (e.g., tabular and non-tabular files) and seamless
		integration with API through authentication, this package is
		designed to enhance workflows involving large-scale data
		management and analysis. Robust error handling and flexible
		configuration ensure reliable performance across diverse data
		environments. Please consult the documentation for the API
		endpoint for your installation.
