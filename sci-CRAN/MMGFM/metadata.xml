		Multi-Study Multi-Modality Generalized Factor Model // We
		introduce a generalized factor model designed to jointly
		analyze high-dimensional multi-modality data from multiple
		studies by extracting study-shared and specified factors. Our
		factor models account for heterogeneous noises and
		overdispersion among modality variables with augmented
		covariates. We propose an efficient and speedy variational
		estimation procedure for estimating model parameters, along
		with a novel criterion for selecting the optimal number of
		factors. More details can be referred to Liu et al. (2024)
