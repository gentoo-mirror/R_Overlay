		Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation // This is an EM
		algorithm based method for imputation of missing values in
		multivariate normal time series. The imputation algorithm
		accounts for both spatial and temporal correlation structures.
		Temporal patterns can be modeled using an ARIMA(p,d,q),
		optionally with seasonal components, a non-parametric cubic
		spline or generalized additive models with exogenous
		covariates. This algorithm is specially tailored for climate
		data with missing measurements from several monitors along a
		given region.
