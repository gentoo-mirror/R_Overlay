		Tools to Match Corporate Lending Portfolios with Climate Data //
		These tools implement in R a fundamental part of the software
		'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment), which
		is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
		portfolios and climate scenarios (https://2degrees-
		investing.org/). Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study
		how their capital allocation decisions align with climate
		change mitigation goals. This package matches data from
		corporate lending portfolios to asset level data from market-
		intelligence databases (e.g. power plant capacities, emission
		factors, etc.). This is the first step to assess if a financial
		portfolio aligns with climate goals.
