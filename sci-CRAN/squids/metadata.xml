		Short Quasi-Unique Identifiers (SQUIDs) // It is often useful to
		produce short, quasi-unique identifiers (SQUIDs) without the
		benefit of a central authority to prevent duplication. Although
		Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) provide for this, these
		are also unwieldy; for example, the most used UUID, version 4,
		is 36 characters long. SQUIDs are short (8 characters) at the
		expense of having more collisions, which can be mitigated by
		combining them with human-produced suffixes, yielding
		relatively brief, half human-readable, almost-unique
		identifiers (see for example the identifiers used for
		Decentralized Construct Taxonomies; Peters  Crutzen, 2024
		doi:10.15626/MP.2022.3638). SQUIDs are the number of
		centiseconds elapsed since the beginning of 1970 converted to a
		base 30 system. This package contains functions to produce
		SQUIDs as well as convert them back into dates and times.
