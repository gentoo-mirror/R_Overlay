		Bayesian Survival Analysis for Right Censored Data // Performs
		unadjusted Bayesian survival analysis for right censored time-
		to-event data. The main function, BayesSurv(), computes the
		posterior mean and a credible band for the survival function
		and for the cumulative hazard, as well as the posterior mean
		for the hazard, starting from a piecewise exponential
		(histogram) prior with Gamma distributed heights that are
		either independent, or have a Markovian dependence structure. A
		function, PlotBayesSurv(), is provided to easily create plots
		of the posterior means of the hazard, cumulative hazard and
		survival function, with a credible band accompanying the latter
		two. The priors and samplers are described in more detail in
		Castillo and Van der Pas (2020) "Multiscale Bayesian survival
		analysis" arXiv:2005.02889. In that paper it is also shown that
		the credible bands for the survival function and the cumulative
		hazard can be considered confidence bands (under mild
		conditions) and thus offer reliable uncertainty quantification.
