		Cluster Gauss-Newton Method // Find multiple solutions of a
		nonlinear least squares problem.  Cluster Gauss-Newton method
		does not assume uniqueness of the solution of the nonlinear
		least squares problem and compute multiple minimizers. Please
		cite the following paper when this software is used in your
		research: Aoki et al. (2020) doi:10.1007/s11081-020-09571-2.
		Cluster GaussNewton method. Optimization and Engineering, 1-31.
		Please cite the following paper when profile likelihood plot is
		drawn with this software and used in your research: Aoki and
		Sugiyama (2024) doi:10.1002/psp4.13055. Cluster Gauss-Newton
		method for a quick approximation of profile likelihood: With
		application to physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models.
