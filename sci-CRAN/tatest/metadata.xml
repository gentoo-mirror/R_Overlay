		Two-Group Ta-Test // The ta-test is a modified two-sample or two-
		group t-test of Gosset (1908). In small samples with less than
		15 replicates,the ta-test significantly reduces type I error
		rate but has almost the same power with the t-test and hence
		can greatly enhance reliability or reproducibility of
		discoveries in biology and medicine. The ta-test can test
		single null hypothesis or multiple null hypotheses without
		needing to correct p-values.
