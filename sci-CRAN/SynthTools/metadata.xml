		Tools and Tests for Experiments with Partially Synthetic Data
		Sets // A set of functions to support experimentation in the
		utility of partially synthetic data sets.  All functions
		compare an observed data set to one or a set of partially
		synthetic data sets derived from the observed data to (1) check
		that data sets have identical attributes, (2) calculate overall
		and specific variable perturbation rates, (3) check for
		potential logical inconsistencies, and (4) calculate confidence
		intervals and standard errors of desired variables in multiple
		imputed data sets. Confidence interval and standard error
		formulas have options for either synthetic data sets or
		multiple imputed data sets. For more information on the
		formulas and methods used, see Reiter  Raghunathan (2007)
		doi:10.1198/016214507000000932.
