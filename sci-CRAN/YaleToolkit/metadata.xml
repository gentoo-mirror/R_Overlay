		Data Exploration Tools from Yale University // This collection of
		data exploration tools was developed at Yale University for the
		graphical exploration of complex multivariate data; barcode and
		gpairs now have their own packages.  The big.read.table()
		function provided here may be useful for large files when only
		a subset is needed (but please see the note in the help page
		for this function).
