		Computation of the MLE for Bivariate Interval Censored Data // We
		provide functions to compute the nonparametric maximum
		likelihood estimator (MLE) for the bivariate distribution of
		(X,Y), when realizations of (X,Y) cannot be observed directly.
		To be more precise, we consider the situation where we observe
		a set of rectangles in R^2 that are known to contain the
		unobservable realizations of (X,Y). We compute the MLE based on
		such a set of rectangles. The methods can also be used for
		univariate censored data (see data set 'cosmesis'), and for
		censored data with competing risks (see data set 'menopause').
		We also provide functions to visualize the observed data and
		the MLE.
