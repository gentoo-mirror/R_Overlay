		Generate Causally-Simulated Data // Generate causally-simulated
		data to serve as ground truth for evaluating methods in causal
		discovery and effect estimation. The package provides tools to
		assist in defining functions based on specified edges, and
		conversely, defining edges based on functions. It enables the
		generation of data according to these predefined functions and
		causal structures. This is particularly useful for researchers
		in fields such as artificial intelligence, statistics, biology,
		medicine, epidemiology, economics, and social sciences, who are
		developing a general or a domain-specific methods to discover
		causal structures and estimate causal effects. Data simulation
		adheres to principles of structural causal modeling. Detailed
		methodologies and examples are documented in our vignette,
		available at https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/
		herdiantrisufriyana/rcausim/blob/master/doc/causal_simulation_e
		xemplar.html.
