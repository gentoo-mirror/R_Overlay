		Concordance Probability Estimates in Survival Analysis //
		Concordance probability estimate (CPE) is a commonly used
		performance measure in survival analysis that evaluates the
		predictive accuracy of a survival model.  It measures how well
		a model can distinguish between pairs of individuals with
		different survival times.  Specifically, it calculate the
		proportion of all pairs of individuals whose predicted survival
		times are correctly ordered.
