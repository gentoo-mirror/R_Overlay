		Solve for Leaf Temperature Using Energy Balance // Implements
		models of leaf temperature using energy balance. It uses units
		to ensure that parameters are properly specified and
		transformed before calculations. It allows separate lower and
		upper surface conductances to heat and water vapour, so
		sensible and latent heat loss are calculated for each surface
		separately  as in Foster and Smith (1986)
		doi:10.1111/j.1365-3040.1986.tb02108.x. It's straightforward to
		model leaf temperature over environmental gradients such as
		light, air temperature, humidity, and wind. It can also model
		leaf temperature over trait gradients such as leaf size or
		stomatal conductance. Other references are Monteith and
		Unsworth (2013, ISBN:9780123869104), Nobel (2009,
		ISBN:9780123741431), and Okajima et al. (2012)
