		Small Area Estimation using HB for Rao Yu Model under Beta
		Distribution // Several functions are provided for small area
		estimation at the area level using the hierarchical bayesian
		(HB) method with panel data under beta distribution for
		variable interest. This package also provides a dataset
		produced by data generation. The 'rjags' package is employed to
		obtain parameter estimates. Model-based estimators involve the
		HB estimators, which include the mean and the variation of the
		mean. For the reference, see Rao and Molina (2015, ISBN:
		978-1-118-73578-7).
