		Tools to Support the Sheffield Elicitation Framework //
		Implements various methods for eliciting a probability
		distribution for a single parameter from an expert or a group
		of experts. The expert provides a small number of probability
		judgements, corresponding to points on his or her cumulative
		distribution function. A range of parametric distributions can
		then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the
		form of fitted probabilities and percentiles. For multiple
		experts, a weighted linear pool can be calculated. Also
		includes functions for eliciting beliefs about population
		distributions, eliciting multivariate distributions using a
		Gaussian copula, eliciting a Dirichlet distribution, and
		eliciting distributions for variance parameters in a random
		effects meta-analysis model. R Shiny apps for most of the
		methods are included.
