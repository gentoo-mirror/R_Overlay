		Tools to Support the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF) //
		Implements various methods for eliciting a probability
		distribution for a single parameter from an expert or a group
		of experts. The expert provides a small number of probability
		or quantile judgements, corresponding to points on his or her
		cumulative distribution function. A range of parametric
		distributions can then be fitted and displayed, with feedback
		provided in the form of additional quantiles. A graphical
		interface for the roulette elicitation method is also provided.
		For multiple experts, a weighted linear pool can be calculated.
