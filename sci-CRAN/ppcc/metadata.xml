		Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient Test // Calculates the
		Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient (PPCC) between a
		continuous variable X and a specified distribution. The
		corresponding composite hypothesis test can be done to test
		whether the sample X is element of either the Normal, log-
		Normal, Exponential, Uniform, Cauchy, Logistic, Generalized
		Logistic, Gumbel (GEVI), Weibull, Generalized Extreme Value,
		Pearson III (Gamma 2), Mielke's Kappa, Rayleigh or Generalized
		Logistic Distribution. The PPCC test is performed with a fast
		Monte-Carlo simulation.
