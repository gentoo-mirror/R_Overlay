		Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient Test // Calculates the
		Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient (PPCC) between a
		continuous variable X and a specified distribution. The
		corresponding composite hypothesis test that was first
		introduced by Filliben (1975) doi:
		10.1080/00401706.1975.10489279 can be performed to test whether
		the sample X is element of either the Normal, log-Normal,
		Exponential, Uniform, Cauchy, Logistic, Generalized Logistic,
		Gumbel (GEVI), Weibull, Generalized Extreme Value, Pearson III
		(Gamma 2), Mielke's Kappa, Rayleigh or Generalized Logistic
		Distribution. The PPCC test is performed with a fast Monte-
		Carlo simulation.
