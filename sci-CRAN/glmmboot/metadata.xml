		Bootstrap Resampling for Mixed Effects and Plain Models //
		Performs bootstrap resampling for most models that update()
		works for. There are two primary functions: bootstrap_model()
		performs block resampling if random effects are present, and
		case resampling if not; bootstrap_ci() converts output from
		bootstrap model runs into confidence intervals and p-values. By
		default, bootstrap_model() calls bootstrap_ci(). Package
		motivated by Humphrey and Swingley (2018) arXiv:1805.08670.
