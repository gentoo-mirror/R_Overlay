		Bootstrap Resampling for Mixed Effects and Plain Models //
		Performs bootstrap resampling for most models that update()
		works for. There are two main functions: BootGlmm() performs
		block resampling if random effects are present, and case
		resampling if not; BootCI() converts output from bootstrap
		model runs into confidence intervals and p-values. By default,
		BootGlmm() calls BootCI(). Package motivated by Humphrey and
		Swingley (2018) arXiv:1805.08670.
