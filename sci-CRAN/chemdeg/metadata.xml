		Analysis of Chemical Degradation Kinetic Data // A collection of
		functions that have been developed to assist experimenter in
		modeling chemical degradation kinetic data. The selection of
		the appropriate degradation model and parameter estimation is
		carried out automatically as far as possible and is driven by a
		rigorous statistical interpretation of the results.  The
		package integrates already available goodness-of-fit statistics
		for nonlinear models. In addition it allows data fitting with
		the nonlinear first-order multi-target (FOMT) model.
