		Estimating Local False Discovery Rates Using Empirical Bayes
		Methods // New empirical Bayes methods aiming at analyzing the
		association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to some
		particular disease are implemented in this package. The package
		uses local false discovery rate (LFDR) estimates of SNPs within
		a sample population defined as a  "reference class" and
		discovers if SNPs are associated with the corresponding
		disease. Although SNPs are used throughout this document, other
		biological data such as protein data and other gene data can be
		used. Karimnezhad, Ali and Bickel, D. R. (2016)
