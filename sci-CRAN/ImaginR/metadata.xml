		Delimit and Characterize Color Phenotype of the Pearl Oyster //
		The pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera (Linnaeus, 1758),
		represents the second economic resource of French Polynesia. It
		is one of the only bivalves expressing a large varied range of
		inner shell color,  by correlation, of pearl color. This
		phenotypic variability is partly under genetic control, but
		also under environmental influence. With ImaginR, it's now
		possible to delimit the color phenotype of the pearl oyster's
		inner shell and to characterize their color variations (by the
		HSV color code system) with pictures.
