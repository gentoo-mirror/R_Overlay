		Network-Style Visualization of Directed Pairwise Relationships //
		Create network-style visualizations of pairwise relationships
		using custom edge glyphs built on top of 'ggplot2'. The package
		supports both statistical and non-statistical data and allows
		users to represent directed relationships. This enables clear,
		publication-ready graphics for exploring and communicating
		relational structures in a wide range of domains. The method
		was first used in Abu-Akel et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0245100. Code is released under the
