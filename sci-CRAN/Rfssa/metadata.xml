		Functional Singular Spectrum Analysis // Methods and tools for
		implementing univariate and multivariate functional singular
		spectrum analysis for functional time series whose variables
		might be observed over different dimensional domains. The
		univariate fssa algorithm is described in Haghbin H., Najibi,
		S.M., Mahmoudvand R., Trinka J., Maadooliat M. (2021) and the
		multivariate fssa over different dimensional domains technique
		may be found in Trinka J., Haghbin H., and Maadooliat M.
		(Accepted). In addition, one may perform forecasting of
		univariate and multivariate fts whose variables are observed
		over one-dimensional domains as described in the dissertation
		of Trinka J. (2021) and the manuscript of Trinka J., Haghbin
		H., Maadooliat M. (2020) where the manuscript is to be
		submitted to a journal for publication.
