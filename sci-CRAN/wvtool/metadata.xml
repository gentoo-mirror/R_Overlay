		Image Tools for Automated Wood Identification // This tool, wood
		vision tool, is intended to facilitate preprocessing and
		analyzing 2-dimensional wood images toward automated
		recognition. The former includes some basics such as functions
		to RGB to grayscale, gray to binary, cropping,
		rotation(bilinear), median/mean/Gaussian filter, and
		Canny/Sobel edge detection. The latter includes gray level co-
		occurrence matrix (GLCM), Haralick parameters, local binary
		pattern (LBP), higher order local autocorrelation (HLAC),
		Fourier transform (radial and azimuthal integration), and Gabor
		filtering. The functions are intended to read data using
		'readTIFF(x,info=T)' from 'tiff' package. The functions in this
		packages basically assumes the grayscale images as input data,
		thus the color images should be subjected to the function
		rgb2gray() before used for some other functions.
