		A-Optimal Block Designs for Comparing Test Treatments with
		Controls // A collection of functions to construct A-optimal
		block designs for comparing test treatments with one or more
		control(s). Mainly A-optimal balanced treatment incomplete
		block designs, weighted A-optimal balanced treatment incomplete
		block designs, A-optimal group divisible treatment designs and
		A-optimal balanced bipartite block designs can be constructed
		using the package. The designs are constructed using algorithms
		based on linear integer programming. To the best of our
		knowledge, these facilities to construct A-optimal block
		designs for comparing test treatments with one or more controls
		are not available in the existing R packages. For more details
		on designs for tests versus control(s) comparisons, please see
		Hedayat, A. S. and Majumdar, D. (1984)
