		Continuous Development Models for Incremental Time-Series
		Analysis // Using the Bayesian state-space approach, we
		developed a continuous development model to quantify dynamic
		incremental changes in the response variable. While the model
		was originally developed for daily changes in forest green-up,
		the model can be used to predict any similar process. The CDM
		can capture both timing and rate of nonlinear processes. Unlike
		statics methods, which aggregate variations into a single
		metric, our dynamic model tracks the changing impacts over
		time. The CDM accommodates nonlinear responses to variation in
		predictors, which changes throughout development.
