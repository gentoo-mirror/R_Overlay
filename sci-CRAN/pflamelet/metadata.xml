		Persistence Flamelets: Computation and Inferential Tools //
		Computes the Persistence Flamelets, a statistical tool for
		exploring the Topological Invariants of Scale-Space families
		introduced in Padellini and Brutti (2017) "Persistence
		Flamelets: multiscale Persistent Homology for kernel density
		exploration" arXiv:1709.07097. Flamelets can be built from
		either sub/super level sets of arbitrary functions or from a
		precomputed list of Persistence Diagrams. In addition, this
		package provides functions to compute confidence bands for a
		Flamelet via bootstrap, assess significance of each feature,
		clean a Flamelet from topological noise, perform a two sample
		permutation test for groups of Flamelets and it also implements
		a topological heuristic for bandwidth selection for kernel
		density estimators.
