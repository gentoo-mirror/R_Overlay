		Make, Update, and Query Binary Causal Models // Users can declare
		binary causal models, update beliefs about causal types given
		data and calculate arbitrary estimands.  Model definition makes
		use of 'dagitty' functionality. Updating is implemented in
		'stan'. The approach used in 'CausalQueries' is a
		generalization of the 'biqq' models described in "Mixing
		Methods: A Bayesian Approach" (Humphreys and Jacobs, 2015,
		DOI:10.1017/S0003055415000453). The conceptual extension makes
		use of work on probabilistic causal models described in Pearl's
		Causality (Pearl, 2009, DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511803161).
