		Converts Tabular Data to Interleaved Vectors // Converts matrices
		and lists of matrices into a single vector by interleaving
		their values. That is, each element of the result vector is
		filled from the input matrices one row at a time. This is the
		same as transposing a matrix, then removing the dimension
		attribute, but is designed to operate on matrices in nested
		list structures.
