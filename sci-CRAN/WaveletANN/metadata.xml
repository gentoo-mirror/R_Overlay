		Wavelet ANN Model // The wavelet and ANN technique have been
		combined to reduce the effect of data noise. This wavelet-ANN
		conjunction model is able to forecast time series data with
		better accuracy than the traditional time series model. This
		package fits hybrid Wavelet ANN model for time series
		forecasting using algorithm by Anjoy and Paul (2017) DOI:
