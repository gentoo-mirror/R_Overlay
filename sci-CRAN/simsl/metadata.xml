		Single-Index Models with a Surface-Link // An implementation of a
		single-index regression for optimizing individualized dose
		rules from an observational study. To model interaction effects
		between baseline covariates and a treatment variable defined on
		a continuum, we employ two-dimensional penalized spline
		regression on an index-treatment domain, where the index is
		defined as a linear combination of the covariates (a single-
		index). An unspecified main effect for the covariates is
		allowed, which can also be modeled through a parametric model.
		A unique contribution of this work is in the parsimonious
		single-index parametrization specifically defined for the
		interaction effect term. We refer to Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and
		Ogden (2020) doi:10.1111/biom.13320 (for the case of a discrete
		treatment) and Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2021) "A
		single-index model with a surface-link for optimizing
		individualized dose rules" arXiv:2006.00267v2 for detail of the
		method. The model can take a member of the exponential family
		as a response variable and can also take an ordinal categorical
		response. The main function of this package is simsl().
