		Single-Index Models with a Surface-Link // An implementation of a
		single-index regression for optimizing individualized dose
		rules from an observational study. To model interaction effects
		between baseline covariates and a treatment variable defined on
		a continuum, we employ two-dimensional penalized spline
		regression on an index-treatment domain, where the index is
		defined as a linear combination of the covariates (a single-
		index). An unspecified main effect for the covariates is
		allowed. A unique contribution of this work is in the
		parsimonious single-index parametrization specifically defined
		for the interaction effect term. We refer to Park, Petkova,
		Tarpey, and Ogden (2020) doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2019.05.008 (for
		the case of a discrete treatment) and Park, Petkova, Tarpey,
		and Ogden (2019) "A single-index model with a surface-link for
		optimizing individualized dose rules" (pre-print) for detail of
		the method. The main function of this package is simsl().
