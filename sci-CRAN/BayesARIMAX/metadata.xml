		Bayesian Estimation of ARIMAX Model // The Autoregressive
		Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is very popular
		univariate time series model. Its application has been widened
		by the incorporation of exogenous variable(s) (X) in the model
		and modified as ARIMAX by Bierens (1987)
		doi:10.1016/0304-4076(87)90086-8. In this package we estimate
		the ARIMAX model using Bayesian framework.
