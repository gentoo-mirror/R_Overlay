		Creation of Empirical Density Functions Based on Multivariate
		Data // Based on the input data an n-dimensional cube with sub
		cells of user specified side length is created. The number of
		sample points which fall in each sub cube is counted, and with
		the cell volume and overall sample size an empirical
		probability can be computed. A number of cubes of higher
		resolution can be superimposed. The basic method stems from
		J.L. Bentley in "Multidimensional Divide and Conquer". J. L.
		Bentley (1980) doi:10.1145/358841.358850. Furthermore a simple
		kernel density estimation method is made available, as well as
		an expansion of Bentleys method, which offers a kernel approach
		for the grid method.
