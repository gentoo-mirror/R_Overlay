		Multivariate Empirical Density Function // Based on the input
		data an n-dimensional cube with sub cells of user specified
		side length is created. The number of sample points which fall
		in each sub cube is counted, and with the cell volume and
		overall sample size an empirical probability can be computed. A
		number of cubes of higher resolution can be superimposed. The
		basic method stems from J.L. Bentley in "Multidimensional
		Divide and Conquer". J. L. Bentley (1980)
