		Protein Feature Extraction from Profile Hidden Markov Models //
		Calculates a comprehensive list of features from profile hidden
		Markov models (HMMs) of proteins. Adapts and ports features for
		use with HMMs instead of Position Specific Scoring Matrices, in
		order to take advantage of more accurate multiple sequence
		alignment by programs such as 'HHBlits' Remmert et al. (2012)
		DOI:10.1038/nmeth.1818 and 'HMMer' Eddy (2011)
		DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002195. Features calculated by this
		package can be used for protein fold classification, protein
		structural class prediction, sub-cellular localization and
		protein-protein interaction, among other tasks. Some examples
		of features extracted are found in Song et al. (2018)
