		threaded serialization of compressed array that fully utilizes
		modern solid state drives. It allows to store and load
		extremely large data on demand within seconds without occupying
		too much memories. With data stored on hard drive, a lazy-array
		data can be loaded, shared across multiple R sessions. For
		arrays with partition mode on, multiple R sessions can write to
		a same array simultaneously along the last dimension
		(partition). The internal storage format is provided by
