		Analysis of Single-Cell Viral Growth Curves // Aims to quantify
		time intensity data by using sigmoidal and double sigmoidal
		curves. It fits straight lines, sigmoidal, and double sigmoidal
		curves on to time vs intensity data. Then all the fits are used
		to make decision on which model (sigmoidal, double sigmoidal,
		no signal or ambiguous) best describes the data. No signal
		means the intensity does not reach a high enough point or does
		not change at all over time. Sigmoidal means intensity starts
		from a small number than climbs to a maximum. Double sigmoidal
		means intensity starts from a small number, climbs to a maximum
		then starts to decay. After the decision between those four
		options, the algorithm gives the sigmoidal (or double
		sigmoidal) associated parameter values that quantifies the time
		intensity curve. The origin of the package name came from
		"SIngle CEll Growth Analysis in R".
