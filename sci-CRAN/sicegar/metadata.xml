		Analysis of Single-Cell Viral Growth Curves // Aims to quantify
		time intensity data by using sigmoidal and double sigmoidal
		curves. It fits straight lines, sigmoidal, and double sigmoidal
		curves on to time vs intensity data. Then all the fits are used
		to make decision on which model best describes the data. This
		method was first developed in the context of single-cell viral
		growth analysis (for details, see Caglar et al. (2018)
		doi:10.7717/peerj.4251), and the package name stands for
		"SIngle CEll Growth Analysis in R".
