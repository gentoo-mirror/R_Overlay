		Reservoir Computing and Echo State Networks // A simple user-
		friendly library based on the 'python' module 'reservoirpy'. It
		provides a flexible interface to implement efficient Reservoir
		Computing (RC) architectures with a particular focus on Echo
		State Networks (ESN). Some of its features are: offline and
		online training, parallel implementation, sparse matrix
		computation, fast spectral initialization, advanced learning
		rules (e.g. Intrinsic Plasticity) etc. It also makes possible
		to easily create complex architectures with multiple reservoirs
		(e.g. deep reservoirs), readouts, and complex feedback loops.
		Moreover, graphical tools are included to easily explore
		hyperparameters. Finally, it includes several tutorials
		exploring time series forecasting, classification and
		hyperparameter tuning. For more information about
		'reservoirpy', please see Trouvain et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-030-61616-8_40. This package was developed in
		the framework of the University of Bordeauxs IdEx "Investments
		for the Future" program / RRI PHDS.
