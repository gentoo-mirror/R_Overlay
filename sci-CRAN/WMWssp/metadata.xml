		Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Sample Size Planning // Calculates the
		minimal sample size for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test that is
		needed for a given power and two sided type I error rate. The
		method works for metric data with and without ties, count data,
		ordered categorical data, and even dichotomous data. But data
		is needed for the reference group to generate synthetic data
		for the treatment group based on a relevant effect. For
		details, see Brunner, E., Bathke A. C. and Konietschke, F:
		Rank- and Pseudo-Rank Procedures in Factorial Designs - Using R
		and SAS, Springer Verlag, to appear.
