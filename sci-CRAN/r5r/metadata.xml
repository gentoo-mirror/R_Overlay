		Rapid Realistic Routing with 'R5' // Rapid realistic routing on
		multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and
		car) using 'R5', the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and
		Reimagined networks engine https://github.com/conveyal/r5. The
		package allows users to generate detailed routing analysis or
		calculate travel time and monetary cost matrices using seamless
		parallel computing on top of the R5 Java machine.  While R5 is
		developed by Conveyal, the package r5r is independently
		developed by a team at the Institute for Applied Economic
		Research (Ipea) with contributions from collaborators. Apart
		from the documentation in this package, users will find
		additional information on R5 documentation at
		https://docs.conveyal.com/. Although we try to keep new
		releases of r5r in synchrony with R5, the development of R5
		follows Conveyal's independent update process. Hence, users
		should confirm the R5 version implied by the Conveyal user
		manual (see https://docs.conveyal.com/changelog) corresponds
		with the R5 version that r5r depends on. This version of r5r
		depends on R5 v7.1.
