		Balancing Central and Marginal Rejection of Pooled p-Values //
		When using pooled p-values to adjust for multiple testing,
		there is an inherent balance that must be struck between
		rejection based on weak evidence spread among many tests and
		strong evidence in a few, explored in Salahub and Olford (2023)
		arXiv:2310.16600. This package provides functionality to
		compute marginal and central rejection levels and the
		centrality quotient for p-value pooling functions and provides
		implementations of the chi-squared quantile pooled p-value
		(described in Salahub and Oldford (2023)) and a proposal from
		Heard and Rubin-Delanchy (2018) doi:10.1093/biomet/asx076 to
		control the quotient's value.
