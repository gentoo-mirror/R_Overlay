		Explainable Boosting Machines // An interface to the 'Python'
		'InterpretML' framework for fitting explainable boosting
		machines (EBMs); see Nori et al. (2019)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1909.09223 for details. EBMs are a modern
		type of generalized additive model that use tree-based, cyclic
		gradient boosting with automatic interaction detection. They
		are often as accurate as state-of-the-art blackbox models while
		remaining completely interpretable.
