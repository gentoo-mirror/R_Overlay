		Fitting Joint Mean and Dispersion Effects Models // Joint mean
		and dispersion effects models fit the mean and dispersion
		parameters of a response variable by two separate linear
		models, the mean and dispersion submodels, simultaneously. It
		also allows the users to choose either the deviance or the
		Pearson residuals as the response variable of the dispersion
		submodel. Furthermore, the package provides the possibility to
		nest the submodels in one another, if one of the parameters has
		significant explanatory power on the other. Wu  Li (2016)
