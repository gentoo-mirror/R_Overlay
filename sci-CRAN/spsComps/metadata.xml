		'systemPipeShiny' UI and Server Components // The systemPipeShiny
		(SPS) framework comes with many UI and server components.
		However, installing the whole framework is heavy and takes some
		time. If you would like to use UI and server components from
		SPS in your own Shiny apps, but do not want to install the
		whole framework, just install this package.
