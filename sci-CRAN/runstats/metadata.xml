		Fast Computation of Running Statistics for Time Series //
		Provides methods for fast computation of running sample
		statistics for time series. These include: (1) mean, (2)
		standard deviation, and (3) variance over a fixed-length window
		of time-series, (4) correlation, (5) covariance, and (6)
		Euclidean distance (L2 norm) between short-time pattern and
		time-series. Implemented methods utilize Convolution Theorem to
		compute convolutions via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
