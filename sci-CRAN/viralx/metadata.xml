		Explainers for Regression Models in HIV Research // A dedicated
		viral-explainer model tool designed to empower researchers in
		the field of HIV research, particularly in viral load and CD4
		(Cluster of Differentiation 4) lymphocytes regression modeling.
		Drawing inspiration from the 'tidymodels' framework for
		rigorous model building of Max Kuhn and Hadley Wickham (2020)
		https://www.tidymodels.org, and the 'DALEXtra' tool for
		explainability by Przemyslaw Biecek (2020)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2009.13248. It aims to facilitate
		interpretable and reproducible research in biostatistics and
		computational biology for the benefit of understanding HIV
		dynamics.
