		Forecast Linear Augmented Projection // The Forecast Linear
		Augmented Projection (flap) method reduces forecast variance by
		adjusting the forecasts of multivariate time series to be
		consistent with the forecasts of linear combinations
		(components) of the series by projecting all forecasts onto the
		space where the linear constraints are satisfied. The forecast
		variance can be reduced monotonically by including more
		components. For a given number of components, the flap method
		achieves maximum forecast variance reduction among linear
		projections.
