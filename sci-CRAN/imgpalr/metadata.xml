		Create Color Palettes from Images // Provides ability to create
		color palettes from image files. It offers control over the
		type of color palette to derive from an image (qualitative,
		sequential or divergent) and other palette properties.
		Quantiles of an image color distribution can be trimmed. Near-
		black or near-white colors can be trimmed in RGB color space
		independent of trimming brightness or saturation distributions
		in HSV color space. Creating sequential palettes also offers
		control over the order of HSV color dimensions to sort by. This
		package differs from other related packages like
		'RImagePalette' in approaches to quantizing and extracting
		colors in images to assemble color palettes and the level of
		user control over palettes construction.
