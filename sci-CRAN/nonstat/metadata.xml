		Detecting Nonstationarity in Time Series // Provides a nonvisual
		procedure for screening time series for nonstationarity in the
		context of intensive longitudinal designs, such as ecological
		momentary assessments. The method combines two diagnostics: one
		for detecting trends (based on the split R-hat statistic from
		Bayesian convergence diagnostics) and one for detecting changes
		in variance (a novel extension inspired by Levene's test). This
		approach allows researchers to efficiently and reproducibly
		detect violations of the stationarity assumption, especially
		when visual inspection of many individual time series is
		impractical. The procedure is suitable for use in all areas of
		research where time series analysis is central. For a detailed
		description of the method and its validation through
		simulations and empirical application, see Zitzmann, S.,
		Lindner, C., Lohmann, J. F.,  Hecht, M. (2024) "A Novel
		Nonvisual Procedure for Screening for Nonstationarity in Time
		Series as Obtained from Intensive Longitudinal Designs" https:/
