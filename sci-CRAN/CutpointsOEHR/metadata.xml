		Optimal Equal-HR Method to Find Two Cutpoints for U-Shaped
		Relationships in Cox Model // Use optimal equal-HR method to
		determine two optimal cutpoints of a continuous predictor that
		has a U-shaped relationship with survival outcomes based on Cox
		regression model. The optimal equal-HR method estimates two
		optimal cut-points that have approximately the same log hazard
		value based on Cox regression model and divides individuals
		into different groups according to their HR values.
