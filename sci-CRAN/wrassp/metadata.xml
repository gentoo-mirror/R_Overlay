		Interface to the 'ASSP' Library // A wrapper around Michel
		Scheffers's 'libassp' (https://libassp.sourceforge.net/). The
		'libassp' (Advanced Speech Signal Processor) library aims at
		providing functionality for handling speech signal files in
		most common audio formats and for performing analyses common in
		phonetic science/speech science. This includes the calculation
		of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean square, auto
		correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing
		rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R with a large
		subset of 'libassp's signal processing functions and provides
		them to the user in a (hopefully) user-friendly manner.
