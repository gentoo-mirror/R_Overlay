		Automatic Model Selection and Prediction for Univariate Time
		Series // Offers a set of functions to easily make predictions
		for univariate time series. 'autoTS' is a wrapper of existing
		functions of the 'forecast' and 'prophet' packages, harmonising
		their outputs in tidy dataframes and using default values for
		each. The core function getBestModel() allows the user to
		effortlessly benchmark seven algorithms along with a bagged
		estimator to identify which one performs the best for a given
		time series.
