		Longitudinal Concordance Correlation // Estimates the
		longitudinal concordance correlation to access the longitudinal
		agreement profile. The estimation approach implemented is
		variance components approach based on polynomial mixed effects
		regression model, as proposed by Oliveira, Hinde and Zocchi
		(2018) doi:10.1007/s13253-018-0321-1.  In addition, non-
