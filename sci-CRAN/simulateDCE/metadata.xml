		Simulate Data for Discrete Choice Experiments // Supports
		simulating choice experiment data for given designs. It helps
		to quickly test different designs against each other and
		compare the performance of new models. The goal of
		'simulateDCE' is to make it easy to simulate choice experiment
		datasets using designs from 'NGENE', 'idefix' or 'spdesign'.
		You have to store the design file(s) in a sub-directory and
		need to specify certain parameters and the utility functions
		for the data generating process. For more details on choice
		experiments see Mariel et al. (2021)
