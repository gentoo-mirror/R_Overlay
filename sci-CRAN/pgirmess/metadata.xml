		Spatial Analysis and Data Mining for Field Ecologists // Set of
		tools for reading, writing and transforming spatial and
		seasonal data in ecology, model selection and specific
		statistical tests. It includes functions to discretize
		polylines into regular point intervals, link observations to
		those points, compute geographical coordinates at regular
		intervals between waypoints, read subsets of big rasters,
		compute zonal statistics or table of categories within polygons
		or circular buffers from raster. The package also provides
		miscellaneous functions for model selection, spatial
		statistics, geometries, writing data.frame with Chinese
		characters, and some other functions for field ecologists.
