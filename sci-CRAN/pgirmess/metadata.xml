		Spatial Analysis and Data Mining for Field Ecologists // Set of
		tools for reading, writing and transforming spatial and
		seasonal data, model selection and specific statistical tests
		for ecologists. It includes functions to interpolate regular
		positions of points between landmarks, to discretize polylines
		into regular point positions, link distant observations to
		points and convert a bounding box in a spatial object. It also
		provides miscellaneous functions for field ecologists such as
		spatial statistics and inference on diversity indexes, writing
		data.frame with Chinese characters.
