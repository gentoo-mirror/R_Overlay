		Multiple Locus Association Mapping on a Genome-Wide Scale // An
		implementation of multiple-locus association mapping on a
		genome-wide scale. 'Eagle' can handle inbred and  outbred study
		populations, populations of arbitrary unknown complexity, and
		data larger than the memory capacity of the computer. Since
		'Eagle' is based on linear mixed models, it is best suited to
		the analysis of data on continuous traits. However, it can
		tolerate non-normal data. 'Eagle' reports, as its findings, the
		best set of snp in strongest association with a trait. For
		users unfamiliar with R, to perform an analysis, run
		'OpenGUI()'. This  opens a web browser to the menu-driven user
		interface for the input of data, and for performing genome-wide
		analysis.
