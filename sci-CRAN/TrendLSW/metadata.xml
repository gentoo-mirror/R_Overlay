		Wavelet Methods for Analysing Locally Stationary Time Series //
		Fitting models for, and simulation of, trend locally stationary
		wavelet (TLSW) time series models, which take account of time-
		varying trend and dependence structure in a univariate time
		series. The TLSW model, and its estimation, is described in
		McGonigle, Killick and Nunes (2022a) doi:10.1111/jtsa.12643,
		(2022b) doi:10.1214/22-EJS2044. New users will likely want to
		start with the TLSW function.
