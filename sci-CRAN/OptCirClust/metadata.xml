		Circular, Periodic, or Framed Data Clustering: Fast, Optimal, and
		Reproducible // Fast, optimal, and reproducible clustering
		algorithms for circular, periodic, or framed data. The
		algorithms introduced in this package are based on a core
		optimal framed clustering algorithm. The runtime of these
		algorithms is O(K N log^2 N), where K is the number of clusters
		and N is the number of circular data points. On a desktop
		computer using a single processor core, millions of circular
		data points can be clustered within seconds. One can use the
		algorithms to characterize events along circular DNA molecules,
		circular RNA molecules, and circular genomes of bacteria,
		chloroplast, and mitochondria. One can also cluster climate
		data along any given longitude or latitude. Periodic data
		clustering can be formulated as circular clustering. The
		algorithms offer a general high-performance solution to
		circular, periodic, or framed data clustering.
