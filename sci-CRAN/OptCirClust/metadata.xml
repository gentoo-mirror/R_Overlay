		Circular, Periodic, or Framed Data Clustering: Fast, Optimal, and
		Reproducible // Fast, optimal, and reproducible clustering
		algorithms for circular, periodic, or framed data. The
		algorithms introduced here are based on a core algorithm for
		optimal framed clustering the authors have developed (under
		review). The runtime of these algorithms is O(K N log^2 N),
		where K is the number of clusters and N is the number of
		circular data points. On a desktop computer using a single
		processor core, millions of data points can be grouped into a
		few clusters within seconds. One can apply the algorithms to
		characterize events along circular DNA molecules, circular RNA
		molecules, and circular genomes of bacteria, chloroplast, and
		mitochondria. One can also cluster climate data along any given
		longitude or latitude. Periodic data clustering can be
		formulated as circular clustering. The algorithms offer a
		general high-performance solution to circular, periodic, or
		framed data clustering.
