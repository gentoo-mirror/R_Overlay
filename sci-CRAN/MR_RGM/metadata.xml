		Multivariate Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Networks //
		Addressing a central challenge encountered in Mendelian
		randomization (MR) studies, where MR primarily focuses on
		discerning the effects of individual exposures on specific
		outcomes and establishes causal links between them. Using a
		network-based methodology, the intricacy involving
		interdependent outcomes due to numerous factors has been
		tackled through this routine. Based on Ni et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1214/17-BA1087, 'MR.RGM' extends to a broader
		exploration of the causal landscape by leveraging on network
		structures and involves the construction of causal graphs that
		capture interactions between response variables and
		consequently between responses and instrument variables.
		'MR.RGM' facilitates the navigation of various data
		availability scenarios effectively by accommodating three input
		formats, i.e., individual-level data and two types of summary-
		level data. In the process, causal effects, adjacency matrices,
		and other essential parameters of the complex biological
		networks, are estimated. Besides, 'MR.RGM' provides uncertainty
		quantification for specific network structures among response
		variables.
