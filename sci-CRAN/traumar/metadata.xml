		Calculate Metrics for Trauma System Performance // Hospitals,
		hospital systems, and even trauma systems that provide care to
		injured patients may not be aware of robust metrics that can
		help gauge the efficacy of their programs in saving the lives
		of injured patients.  'traumar' provides robust functions
		driven by the academic literature to automate the calculation
		of relevant metrics to individuals desiring to measure the
		performance of their trauma center or even a trauma system.
		'traumar' also provides some helper functions for the data
		analysis journey. Users can refer to the following publications
		for descriptions of the methods used in 'traumar'. TRISS
		methodology, including probability of survival, and the W, M,
		and Z Scores - Flora (1978)
