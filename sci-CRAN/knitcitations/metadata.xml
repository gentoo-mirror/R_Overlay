		Citations for 'Knitr' Markdown Files // Provides the ability to
		create dynamic citations in which the bibliographic information
		is pulled from the web rather than having to be entered into a
		local database such as 'bibtex' ahead of time. The package is
		primarily aimed at authoring in the R 'markdown' format, and
		can provide outputs for web-based authoring such as linked text
		for inline citations.  Cite using a 'DOI', URL, or 'bibtex'
		file key.  See the package URL for details.
