		Read/Write Files in Key-Value-Hierarchy Format // The format KVH
		is a lightweight format that can be read/written both by humans
		and machines. It can be useful in situations where XML or alike
		formats seem to be an overkill. We provide an ability to parse
		KVH files in R pretty fast due to 'Rcpp' use.
