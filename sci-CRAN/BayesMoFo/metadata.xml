		Bayesian Mortality Forecasting // Carry out Bayesian estimation
		and forecasting for a variety of stochastic mortality models
		using vague prior distributions. Models supported include
		numerous well-established approaches introduced in the
		actuarial and demographic literature, such as the Lee-Carter
		(1992) doi:10.1080/01621459.1992.10475265, the Cairns-Blake-
		Dowd (2009) doi:10.1080/10920277.2009.10597538, the Li-Lee
		(2005) doi:10.1353/dem.2005.0021, and the Plat (2009)
		doi:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2009.08.006 models. The package is
		designed to analyse stratified mortality data structured as a
		3-dimensional array of dimensions p  A  T (strata  age  year).
		Stratification can represent factors such as cause of death,
		country, deprivation level, sex, geographic region, insurance
		product, marital status, socioeconomic group, or smoking
		behavior. While the primary focus is on analysing stratified
		data (p  1), the package can also handle mortality data that
		are not stratified (p = 1). Model selection via the Deviance
		Information Criterion (DIC) is supported.
