		Tools for Assessment the Association Between Two Spatial
		Processes // Tools to assess the association between two
		spatial processes. Currently, four methodologies are
		implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing
		about the independence between the processes, a suitable
		nonparametric correlation coefficient, the codispersion
		coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple
		correlation between one spatial process and several others.
		SpatialPack gives methods to complement methodologies that are
		available in geoR for one spatial process.
