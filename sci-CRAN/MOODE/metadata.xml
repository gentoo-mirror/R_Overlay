		Multi-Objective Optimal Design of Experiments // Provides
		functionality to generate compound optimal designs for
		targeting the multiple experimental objectives directly,
		ensuring that the full set of research questions is answered as
		economically as possible. Designs can be found using point or
		coordinate exchange algorithms combining estimation, inference
		and lack-of-fit criteria that account for model inadequacy.
		Details and examples are given by Koutra et al. (2024)
