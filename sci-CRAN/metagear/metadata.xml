		Comprehensive Research Synthesis Tools for Systematic Reviews and
		Meta-Analysis // Functionalities for facilitating systematic
		reviews, data extractions, and meta-analyses. It includes a GUI
		(graphical user interface) to help screen the abstracts and
		titles of bibliographic data; tools to assign screening effort
		across multiple collaborators/reviewers and to assess inter-
		reviewer reliability; tools to help automate the download and
		retrieval of journal PDF articles from online databases; figure
		and image extractions from PDFs; web scraping of citations;
		automated and manual data extraction from scatter-plot and bar-
		plot images; PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
		Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagrams; simple imputation
		tools to fill gaps in incomplete or missing study parameters;
		generation of random effects sizes for Hedges' d, log response
		ratio, odds ratio, and correlation coefficients for Monte Carlo
		experiments; covariance equations for modelling dependencies
		among multiple effect sizes (e.g., effect sizes with a common
		control); and finally summaries that replicate analyses and
		outputs from widely used but no longer updated meta-analysis
		software (i.e., metawin). Funding for this package was
		supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants
		DBI-1262545 and DEB-1451031.
