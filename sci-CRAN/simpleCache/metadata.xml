		Simply Caching R Objects // Provides intuitive functions for
		caching R objects, encouraging reproducible, restartable, and
		distributed R analysis. The user selects a location to store
		caches, and then provides  nothing more than a cache name and
		instructions (R code) for how to produce the R object. Also
		provides some advanced options like environment assignments,
		recreating or reloading caches, and cluster compute bindings
		(using the 'batchtools' package) making it flexible enough for
		use in large-scale data analysis projects.
