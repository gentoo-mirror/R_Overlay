		Alternative Tour Frame Interpolation Method // This method
		generates a tour path by interpolating between d-D frames in
		p-D using Givens rotations. The algorithm arises from the
		problem of zeroing elements of a matrix. This interpolation
		method is useful for showing specific d-D frames in the tour,
		as opposed to d-D planes, as done by the geodesic
		interpolation. It is useful for projection pursuit indexes
		which are not s invariant. See more details in Buj, Cook,
		Asimov and Hurley (2005) doi:10.1016/S0169-7161(04)24014-7 and
		Batsaikhan, Cook and Laa (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2311.08181.
