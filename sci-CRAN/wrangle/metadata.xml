		A Systematic Data Wrangling Idiom // Supports systematic
		scrutiny, modification, and integration of data. The function
		status() counts rows that have missing values in grouping
		columns (returned by na() ), have non-unique combinations of
		grouping columns (returned by dup() ), and that are not locally
		sorted (returned by unsorted() ). Functions enumerate() and
		itemize() give sorted unique combinations of columns, with or
		without occurrence counts, respectively. Function ignore()
		drops columns in x that are present in y, and informative()
		drops columns in x that are entirely NA. Data that have defined
		unique combinations of grouping values behave more predictably
		during merge operations.
