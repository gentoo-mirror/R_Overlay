		Estimation of Cell Infiltration Based on Cell Crosstalk // A
		systematic biology tool was developed to identify cell
		infiltration via an Individualized Cell crosstalk network.
		'CITMIC' first constructed a weighted cell crosstalk network by
		integrating Cell-target interaction information, biological
		process data from the Gene Ontology (GO) database, and gene
		transcriptomic data in a specific sample, and then, it used a
		network propagation algorithm on the network to identify cell
		infiltration for the sample. Ultimately, cell infiltration in
		the patient dataset was obtained by normalizing the centrality
		scores of the cells.
