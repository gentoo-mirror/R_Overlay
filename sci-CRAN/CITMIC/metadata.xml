		Estimation of Cell Infiltration Based on Cell Crosstalk // A
		systematic biology tool was developed to identify cell
		infiltration via Individualized Cell-Cell interaction network.
		'CITMIC' first constructed a weighted cell interaction network
		through integrating Cell-target interaction information,
		molecular function data from Gene Ontology (GO) database and
		gene transcriptomic data in specific sample, and then, it used
		a network propagation algorithm on the network to identify cell
		infiltration for the sample. Ultimately, cell infiltration in
		the patient dataset was obtained by normalizing the centrality
		scores of the cells.
