		Identification of Impulse-Like Gene Expression Changes in Short
		Genomic Series Data // Enables the user to systematically
		identify and visualize impulse-like gene expression changes
		within short genomic series experiments. In order to detect
		such activation peaks, the gene expression is treated as a
		signal that propagates along an experimental axis (time,
		temperature or other series conditions). Peaks are selected by
		exhaustive identification of local maximums and subsequent
		filtering based on a range of controllable parameters.
		Moreover, the 'Biopeak' package provides a series of data
		exploration tools including: expression profile plots,
		correlation heat maps and clustering functionalities.
