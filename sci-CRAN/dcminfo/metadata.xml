		Information Matrix for Diagnostic Classification Models // A set
		of asymptotic methods that can be used to directly estimate the
		expected (Fisher) information matrix by Liu, Tian, and Xin
		(2016) doi:10.3102/1076998615621293 in diagnostic
		classification models or cognitive diagnostic models are
		provided when marginal maximum likelihood estimation is used.
		For these methods, both the item and structural model
		parameters are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the
		observed information matrix, the empirical cross-product
		information matrix and the sandwich-type co-variance matrix
		that can be used to estimate the asymptotic co-variance matrix
		(or the model parameter standard errors) within the context of
		diagnostic classification models are provided.
