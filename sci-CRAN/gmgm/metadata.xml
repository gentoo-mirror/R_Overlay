		Gaussian Mixture Graphical Model Learning and Inference //
		Gaussian mixture graphical models include Bayesian networks and
		dynamic Bayesian networks (their temporal extension) whose
		local probability distributions are described by Gaussian
		mixture models. They are powerful tools for graphically and
		quantitatively representing nonlinear dependencies between
		continuous variables. This package provides a complete
		framework to create, manipulate, learn the structure and the
		parameters, and perform inference in these models. Most of the
		algorithms are described in the PhD thesis of Roos (2018)
