		Moving-Window and Direct Data Aggregation // Data aggregation via
		moving window or direct methods. Aggregate a fine-resolution
		raster to a grid. The moving window method smooths the surface
		using a specified function within a moving window of a
		specified size and shape prior to aggregation. The direct
		method simply aggregates to the grid using the specified
		function. The package differs from other packages offering
		moving window analysis in 2 key ways: 1. The moving window code
		has been optimised so that it runs more quickly than
		\code{raster::focal} or other packages that build on this; 2.
		It combines moving window and aggregation in a way which can be
		effectively parallelised.
