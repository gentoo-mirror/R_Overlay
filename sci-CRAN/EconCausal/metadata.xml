		Causal Analysis for Macroeconomic Time Series (ECM-MARS, BSTS,
		Bayesian GLM-AR(1)) // Implements three complementary pipelines
		for causal analysis on macroeconomic time series: (1) Error-
		Correction Models with Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
		(ECM-MARS), (2) Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS), and (3)
		Bayesian GLM with AR(1) errors validated with Leave-Future-Out
		(LFO). Heavy backends (Stan) are optional and never used in
