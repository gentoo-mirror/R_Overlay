		Chain Event Graph // Create and learn Chain Event Graph (CEG)
		models using a Bayesian framework. It provides us with a
		Hierarchical Agglomerative algorithm to search the CEG model
		space. The package also includes several facilities for
		visualisations of the objects associated with a CEG. The CEG
		class can represent a range of relational data types, and
		supports arbitrary vertex, edge and graph attributes. A Chain
		Event Graph is a tree-based graphical model that provides a
		powerful graphical interface through which domain experts can
		easily translate a process into sequences of observed events
		using plain language. CEGs have been a useful class of
		graphical model especially to capture context-specific
		conditional independences. References: Collazo R, Gorgen C,
