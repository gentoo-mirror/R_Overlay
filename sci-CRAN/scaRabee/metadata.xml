		Optimization Toolkit for Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Models
		// A port of the Scarabee toolkit originally written as a
		Matlab-based application. scaRabee provides a framework for
		simulation and optimization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
		models at the individual and population level. It is built on
		top of the neldermead package, which provides the direct search
		algorithm proposed by Nelder and Mead for model optimization.
