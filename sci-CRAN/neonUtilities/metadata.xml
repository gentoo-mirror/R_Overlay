		Utilities for Working with NEON Data // NEON data packages can be
		accessed through the NEON Data Portal
		http://data.neonscience.org or through the NEON Data API (see
		http://data.neonscience.org/data-api for documentation). Data
		delivered from the Data Portal are provided as monthly zip
		files packaged within a parent zip file, while individual files
		can be accessed from the API. This package provides tools that
		aid in discovering, downloading, and reformatting data prior to
		use in analyses. This includes downloading data via the API,
		merging data tables by type, and converting formats. For more
		information, see the readme file at
		https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities.
