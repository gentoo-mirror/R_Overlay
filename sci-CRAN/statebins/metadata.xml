		Create United States Uniform Cartogram Heatmaps // The
		'cartogram' heatmaps generated by the included methods are an
		alternative to choropleth maps for the United States and are
		based on work by the Washington Post graphics department in
		their report on "The states most threatened by trade"
		(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/states-
		most-threatened-by-trade/). "State bins" preserve as much of
		the geographic placement of the states as possible but have the
		look and feel of a traditional heatmap. Functions are provided
		that allow for use of a binned, discrete scale, a continuous
		scale or manually specified colors depending on what is needed
		for the underlying data.
