		Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier // Functions to work with
		date-times and time-spans: fast and user friendly parsing of
		date-time data, extraction and updating of components of a
		date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds),
		algebraic manipulation on date-time and time-span objects. The
		'lubridate' package has a consistent and memorable syntax that
		makes working with dates easy and fun. Parts of the 'CCTZ'
		source code, released under the Apache 2.0 License, are
		included in this package. See https://github.com/google/cctz
		for more details.
