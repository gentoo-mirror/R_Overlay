		Bayesian Structure Learning in Graphical Models using Birth-Death
		MCMC // Provides statistical tools for Bayesian structure
		learning in undirected graphical models for continuous,
		discrete, and mixed data. The package is implemented the recent
		improvements in the Bayesian graphical models literature,
		including Mohammadi and Wit (2015) doi:10.1214/14-BA889 and
		Mohammadi et al. (2017) doi:10.1111/rssc.12171. To speed up the
		computations, the BDMCMC sampling algorithms are implemented in
		parallel using OpenMP in C++.
