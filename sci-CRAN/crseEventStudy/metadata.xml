		A Robust and Powerful Test of Abnormal Stock Returns in Long-
		Horizon Event Studies // Based on Dutta et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.jempfin.2018.02.004, this package provides their
		standardized test for abnormal returns in long-horizon event
		studies. The methods used improve the major weaknesses of size,
		power, and robustness of long-run statistical tests described
		in Kothari/Warner (2007)
		doi:10.1016/B978-0-444-53265-7.50015-9. Abnormal returns are
		weighted by their statistical precision (i.e., standard
		deviation), resulting in abnormal standardized returns. This
		procedure efficiently captures the heteroskedasticity problem.
		Clustering techniques following Cameron et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1198/jbes.2010.07136 are adopted for computing cross-
		sectional correlation robust standard errors. The statistical
		tests in this package therefore accounts for potential biases
		arising from returns' cross-sectional correlation,
		autocorrelation, and volatility clustering without power loss.
