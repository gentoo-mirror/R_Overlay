		An Interface to Specify Causal Graphs and Compute Bounds on
		Causal Effects // When causal quantities are not identifiable
		from the observed data, it still may be possible to bound these
		quantities using the observed data. We outline a class of
		problems for which the derivation of tight bounds is always a
		linear programming problem and can therefore, at least
		theoretically, be solved using a symbolic linear optimizer. We
		extend and generalize the approach of Balke and Pearl (1994)
		doi:10.1016/B978-1-55860-332-5.50011-0 and we provide a user
		friendly graphical interface for setting up such problems via
		directed acyclic graphs (DAG), which only allow for problems
		within this class to be depicted. The user can then define
		linear constraints to further refine their assumptions to meet
		their specific problem, and then specify a causal query using a
		text interface. The program converts this user defined DAG,
		query, and constraints, and returns tight bounds. The bounds
		can be converted to R functions to evaluate them for specific
		datasets, and to latex code for publication. The methods and
		proofs of tightness and validity of the bounds are described in
		a preprint by Sachs, Gabriel, and Sjlander (2020) https://sachs
		mc.github.io/causaloptim/articles/CausalBoundsMethods.pdf.
