		Computing Statistically-Equivalent Path Models // Tools to
		compute and analyze the set of statistically-equivalent
		(Gaussian, linear) path models which generate the input
		precision or (partial) correlation matrix. This procedure is
		useful for understanding how statistical network models such as
		the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) perform as causal discovery
		tools. The statistical-equivalence set of a given GGM expresses
		the uncertainty we have about the sign, size and direction of
		directed relationships based on the weights matrix of the GGM
		alone. The derivation of the equivalence set and its use for
		understanding GGMs as causal discovery tools is described by
