		A Framework for Coalescent Simulation // Coalescent simulators
		can rapidly simulate biological sequences evolving according to
		a given model of evolution. You can use this package to specify
		such models, to conduct the simulations and to calculate
		additional statistics from the results (Staab, Metzler, 2016
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw098). It relies on existing
		simulators for doing the simulation, and currently supports the
		programs 'ms', 'msms' and 'scrm'. It also supports finite-sites
		mutation models by combining the simulators with the program
		'seq-gen'.
