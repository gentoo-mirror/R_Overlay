		Bi-Level Selection of Conditional Main Effects // Provides
		functions for implementing cmenet - a bi-level variable
		selection method for conditional main effects (see Mak and Wu
		(2018) doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1448828). CMEs are
		reparametrized interaction effects which capture the
		conditional impact of a factor at a fixed level of another
		factor. Compared to traditional two-factor interactions, CMEs
		quantify more interpretable interaction effects in many
		problems of interest (e.g., genomics, molecular engineering,
		personalized medicine). The current implementation performs
		variable selection on only binary CMEs, but we are working on
		an extension for the continuous setting. This work was
		supported by USARO grant W911NF-14-1-0024.
