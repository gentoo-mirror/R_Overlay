		Bi-Level Selection of Conditional Main Effects // Provides
		functions for implementing cmenet - a bi-level variable
		selection method for conditional main effects (see Mak and Wu
		(2018) doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1448828). CMEs are
		reparametrized interaction effects which capture the
		conditional impact of a factor at a fixed level of another
		factor. Compared to traditional two-factor interactions, CMEs
		can quantify more interpretable interaction effects in many
		problems. The current implementation performs variable
		selection on only binary CMEs; we are working on an extension
		for the continuous setting.
