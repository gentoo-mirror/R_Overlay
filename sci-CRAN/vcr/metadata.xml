		Record 'HTTP' Calls to Disk // Record test suite 'HTTP' requests
		and replays them during future runs. A port of the Ruby gem of
		the same name (https://github.com/vcr/vcr/). Works by hooking
		into the 'webmockr' R package for matching 'HTTP' requests by
		various rules ('HTTP' method, 'URL', query parameters, headers,
		body, etc.), and then caching real 'HTTP' responses on disk in
		'cassettes'. Subsequent 'HTTP' requests matching any previous
		requests in the same 'cassette' use a cached 'HTTP' response.
