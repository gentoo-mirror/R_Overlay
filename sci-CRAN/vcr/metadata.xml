		Record 'HTTP' Calls to Disk // Record test suite 'HTTP' requests
		and replays them during future runs. A port of the Ruby gem of
		the same name (https://github.com/vcr/vcr/). Works by recording
		real 'HTTP' requests/responses on disk in 'cassettes', and then
		replaying matching responses on subsequent requests.
