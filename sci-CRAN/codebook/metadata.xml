		Automatic Codebooks from Survey Metadata Encoded in Attributes //
		Easily automate the following tasks to describe data frames:
		summarise the distributions of scales and items graphically and
		using descriptive statistics, compute reliabilities (internal
		consistencies, retest, multilevel) for psychological scales,
		combine this information with metadata (such as item labels and
		labelled values) that is derived from R attributes. To do so,
		the package relies on 'rmarkdown' partials, so you can generate
		HTML, PDF, and Word documents. Codebooks are also available as
		tables (CSV, Excel, etc.). The metadata and codebooks are also
		available at your fingertips via RStudio Addins.
