		Automatic Codebooks from Metadata Encoded in Dataset Attributes
		// Easily automate the following tasks to describe data frames:
		Summarise the distributions, and labelled missings of variables
		graphically and using descriptive statistics. For surveys,
		compute and summarise reliabilities (internal consistencies,
		retest, multilevel) for psychological scales. Combine this
		information with metadata (such as item labels and labelled
		values) that is derived from R attributes. To do so, the
		package relies on 'rmarkdown' partials, so you can generate
		HTML, PDF, and Word documents. Codebooks are also available as
		tables (CSV, Excel, etc.) and in JSON-LD, so that search
		engines can find your data and index the metadata. The metadata
		are also available at your fingertips via RStudio Addins.
