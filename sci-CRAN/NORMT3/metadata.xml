		Evaluates Complex Erf, Erfc, Faddeeva, and Density of Sum of
		Gaussian and Student's t // Evaluates the probability density
		function of the sum of the Gaussian and Student's t density on
		3 degrees of freedom. Evaluates the p.d.f. of the sphered
		Student's t density function. Also evaluates the erf, and erfc
		functions on complex-valued arguments. Thanks to Krishna Myneni
		the function is calculates the Faddeeva function also!
