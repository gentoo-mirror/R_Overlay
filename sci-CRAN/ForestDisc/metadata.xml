		Forest Discretization // Supervised, multivariate, and non-
		parametric discretization algorithm based on tree ensembles
		learning and moment matching optimization. This version of the
		algorithm relies on random forest algorithm to learn a large
		set of split points that conserves the relationship between
		attributes and the target class, and on moment matching
		optimization to transform this set into a reduced number of cut
		points matching as well as possible statistical properties of
		the initial set of split points. For each attribute to be
		discretized, the set S of its related split points extracted
		through random forest is mapped to a reduced set C of cut
		points of size k. This mapping relies on minimizing, for each
		continuous attribute to be discretized, the distance between
		the four first moments of S and the four first moments of C
		subject to some constraints. This non-linear optimization
		problem is performed using k values ranging from 2 to
		'max_splits', and the best solution returned correspond to the
		value k which optimum solution is the lowest one over the
		different realizations. ForestDisc is a generalization of
		RFDisc discretization method initially proposed by Berrado and
		Runger (2009) doi:10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069327, and improved by
		Berrado et al. in 2012 by adopting the idea of moment matching
		optimization related by Hoyland and Wallace (2001) doi:
		10.1287/mnsc.47.2.295.9834.
