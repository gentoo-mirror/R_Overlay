		Variable Importance in Clustering // An implementation of methods
		related to sparse clustering and variable importance in
		clustering. The package currently allows to perform sparse
		k-means clustering with a group penalty, so that it
		automatically selects groups of numerical features. It also
		allows to perform sparse clustering and variable selection on
		mixed data (categorical and numerical features), by
		preprocessing each categorical feature as a group of numerical
		features. Several methods for visualizing and exploring the
		results are also provided. M. Chavent, J. Lacaille, A. Mourer
		and M. Olteanu (2020)https://www.esann.org/sites/default/files/
