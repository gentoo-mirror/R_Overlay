		Modelling Spatial Extremes // Tools for the statistical modelling
		of spatial extremes using max-stable processes, copula or
		Bayesian hierarchical models. More precisely, this package
		allows (conditional) simulations from various parametric max-
		stable models, analysis of the extremal spatial dependence, the
		fitting of such processes using composite likelihoods or least
		square (simple max-stable processes only), model checking and
		selection and prediction. Other approaches (althought not
		completely in agreement with the extreme value theory) are
		avaible such as the use of (spatial) copula and Bayesian
		hierarchical models assuming the so-called conditional
		assumptions. The latter approaches is handled through an
		(efficient) Gibbs sampler. Some key references: Davison et al.
