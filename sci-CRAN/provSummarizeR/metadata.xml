		Summarizes Provenance Related to Inputs and Outputs of a Script
		or Console Commands // Reads the provenance collected by the
		'rdtLite' or 'rdt' packages, or other tools providing
		compatible PROV JSON output, created by the execution of a
		script or a console session, and provides a human-readable
		summary identifying the input and output files, the scripts
		used (if any), errors and warnings produced, and the
		environment in which it was executed. It can also optionally
		package all the files into a zip file.  The exact format of the
		PROV JSON file created by 'rdtLite' and 'rdt' is described in
		https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson.
		More information about 'rdtLite' and associated tools is
		available at https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ and
		Lerner, Boose, and Perez (2018), Using Introspection to Collect
		Provenance in R, Informatics, doi: 10.3390/informatics5010012.
