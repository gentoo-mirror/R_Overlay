		Summarizes Provenance Related to Inputs and Outputs of a Script
		or Console Commands // Reads the provenance collected by the
		'rdtLite' or 'rdt' packages, or other tools providing
		compatible PROV JSON output, created by the execution of a
		script or a console session, and provides a human-readable
		summary identifying the input and output files, the script used
		(if any), errors and warnings produced, and the environment in
		which it was executed.  It can also optionally package all the
		files into a zip file.  The exact format of the JSON created by
		'rdtLite' and 'rdt' is described in https://github.com/End-to-
		end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson. More information about
		'rdtLite' and associated tools is available at
		https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ and Barbara Lerner,
		Emery Boose, and Luis Perez (2018), Using Introspection to
		Collect Provenance in R, Informatics, doi:
