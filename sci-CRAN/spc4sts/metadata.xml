		Statistical Process Control for Stochastic Textured Surfaces //
		Provides statistical process control tools for stochastic
		textured surfaces. The current version supports the following
		tools: (1) generic modeling of stochastic textured surfaces.
		(2) local defect monitoring and diagnostics in stochastic
		textured surfaces, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2018a)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.2017.1302362. (3) global change monitoring
		in the nature of stochastic textured surfaces, which was
		proposed by Bui and Apley (2018b)
		doi:10.1080/00224065.2018.1507559. (4) computation of
		dissimilarity matrix of stochastic textured surface images.
