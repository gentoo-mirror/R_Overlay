		Machine Learning for Merging Satellite and Ground Precipitation
		Data // A machine learning algorithm that merges satellite and
		ground precipitation data using Random Forest for spatial
		prediction, residual modeling for bias correction, and quantile
		mapping for adjustment, ensuring accurate estimates across
		temporal scales and regions.
