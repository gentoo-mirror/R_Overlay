		Progressive Bias Correction of Satellite Environmental Data //
		Implements a bias correction method that combines Random Forest
		models with Quantile Mapping to improve the accuracy of
		satellite-derived environmental datasets. The model corrects
		biases in meteorological variables, such as precipitation and
		temperature, by integrating in situ measurements and a Digital
		Elevation Model (DEM).
