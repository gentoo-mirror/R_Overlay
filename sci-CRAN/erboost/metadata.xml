		Nonparametric Multiple Expectile Regression via ER-Boost //
		Expectile regression is a nice tool for estimating the
		conditional expectiles of a response variable given a set of
		covariates. This package implements a regression tree based
		gradient boosting estimator for nonparametric multiple
		expectile regression, proposed by Yang, Y., Qian, W. and Zou,
		H. (2018) doi:10.1080/00949655.2013.876024. The code is based
		on the 'gbm' package originally developed by Greg Ridgeway.
