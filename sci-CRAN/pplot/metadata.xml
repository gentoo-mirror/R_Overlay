		Chronological and Ordered p-Plots for Empirical Data // Generates
		chronological and ordered p-plots for data vectors or vectors
		of p-values. The p-plot visualizes the evolution of the p-value
		of a significance test across the sampled data. It allows for
		assessing the consistency of the observed effects, for
		detecting the presence of potential moderator variables, and
		for estimating the influence of outlier values on the observed
		results. For non-significant findings, it can diagnose patterns
		indicative of underpowered study designs. The p-plot can thus
		either back the binary accept-vs-reject decision of common
		null-hypothesis significance tests, or it can qualify this
		decision and stimulate additional empirical work to arrive at
		more robust and replicable statistical inferences.
