		Blocking and Randomization for Experimental Design //
		Intelligently assign samples to batches in order to reduce
		batch effects. Batch effects can have a significant impact on
		data analysis, especially when the assignment of samples to
		batches coincides with the contrast groups being studied. By
		defining a batch container and a scoring function that reflects
		the contrasts, this package allows users to assign samples in a
		way that minimizes the potential impact of batch effects on the
		comparison of interest. Among other functionality, we provide
		an implementation for OSAT score by Yan et al. (2012,
		doi:10.1186/1471-2164-13-689).
