		Ordinary Least Squares Trajectory Analysis // The 'OLStrajr'
		package provides comprehensive functions for ordinary least
		squares (OLS) trajectory analysis and case-by-case OLS
		regression as outlined in Carrig, Wirth, and Curran (2004)
		doi:10.1207/S15328007SEM1101_9 and Rogosa and Saner (1995)
		doi:10.3102/10769986020002149. It encompasses two primary
		functions, OLStraj() and cbc_lm(). The OLStraj() function
		simplifies the estimation of individual growth curves over time
		via OLS regression, with options for visualizing both group-
		level and individual-level growth trajectories and support for
		linear and quadratic models. The cbc_lm() function facilitates
		case-by-case OLS estimates and provides unbiased mean
		population intercept and slope estimators by averaging OLS
		intercepts and slopes across cases. It further offers standard
		error calculations across bootstrap replicates and computation
		of 95% confidence intervals based on empirical distributions
		from the resampling processes.
