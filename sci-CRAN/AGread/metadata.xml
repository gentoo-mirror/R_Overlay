		Read Data Files from ActiGraph Monitors // Standardize the
		process of bringing various modes of output files into 'R'.
		Additionally, processes are provided to read and minimally pre-
		process raw data from primary accelerometer and inertial
		measurement unit files, as well as binary .gt3x files.
		ActiGraph monitors are used to estimate physical activity
		outcomes via body-worn sensors that measure (e.g.) acceleration
		or rotational velocity.
