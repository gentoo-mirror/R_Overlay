		Identification and Statistical Analysis of Conserved Waters Near
		Proteins // Identify and analyze conserved waters within
		crystallographic protein structures and molecular dynamics
		simulation trajectories. Statistical parameters for each water
		cluster, informative graphs, and a PyMOL session file to
		visually explore the conserved waters and protein are returned.
		Hydrophilicity is the propensity of waters to congregate near
		specific protein atoms and is related to conserved waters. An
		informatics derived set of hydrophilicity values are provided
		based on a large, high-quality X-ray protein structure dataset.
