		Binning Variables to Use in Logistic Regression // Fast binning
		of multiple variables using parallel processing. A summary of
		all the variables binned is generated which provides the
		information value, entropy, an indicator of whether the
		variable follows a monotonic trend or not, etc. It supports
		rebinning of variables to force a monotonic trend as well as
		manual binning based on pre specified cuts. The cut points of
		the bins are based on conditional inference trees as
		implemented in the partykit package. The conditional inference
		framework is described by Hothorn T, Hornik K, Zeileis A (2006)
