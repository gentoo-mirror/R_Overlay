		Multi-Cohort Selection Bias Correction using IPW and AIPW Methods
		// Comprehensive toolkit for addressing selection bias in
		binary disease models across diverse non-probability samples,
		each with unique selection mechanisms. It utilizes Inverse
		Probability Weighting (IPW) and Augmented Inverse Probability
		Weighting (AIPW) methods to reduce selection bias effectively
		in multiple non-probability cohorts by integrating data from
		either individual-level or summary-level external sources. The
		package also provides a variety of variance estimation
		techniques. Please refer to Kundu et al.
