		Classifying High-Dimensional Phenotypes with Ensemble Learning //
		A system for binary and multi-class classification of high-
		dimensional phenotypic data using ensemble learning. By
		combining predictions from different classification models,
		this package attempts to improve performance over individual
		learners. The pre-processing, training, validation, and testing
		are performed end-to-end to minimize user input and simplify
		the process of classification.
