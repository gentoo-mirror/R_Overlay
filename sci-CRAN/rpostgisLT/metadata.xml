		Managing Animal Movement Data with 'PostGIS' and R // Integrates
		R and the 'PostgreSQL/PostGIS' database system to build and
		manage animal trajectory (movement) data sets. The package
		relies on 'ltraj' objects from the R package 'adehabitatLT',
		building the analogous 'pgtraj' data structure in 'PostGIS'.
		Functions allow users to seamlessly transfer between 'ltraj'
		and 'pgtraj', as well as build new 'pgtraj' directly from
		location data stored in the database.
