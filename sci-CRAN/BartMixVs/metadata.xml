		Variable Selection Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees //
		Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provides flexible
		non-parametric modeling of mixed-type predictors for continuous
		and binary responses. This package is built upon CRAN R package
		'BART', version 2.7 (https://github.com/cran/BART). It
		implements the three proposed variable selection approaches in
		the paper: Luo, C and Daniels, M. J. (2021), "Variable
		Selection Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees."
		arXiv:2112.13998, and other three existing BART-based variable
		selection approaches.
