		Privacy-Preserving Distributed Algorithms // A collection of
		privacy-preserving distributed algorithms for conducting multi-
		site data analyses. The regression analyses can be linear
		regression for continuous outcome, logistic regression for
		binary outcome, Cox proportional hazard regression for time-to
		event outcome, or Poisson regression for count outcome. The PDA
		algorithm runs on a lead site and only requires summary
		statistics from collaborating sites, with one or few
		iterations. For more information, please visit our software
		websites: https://github.com/Penncil/pda, and
		https://penncil2019pda.wixsite.com/mysite.
