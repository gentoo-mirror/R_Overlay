		Disaster Victim Identification // Joint DNA-based disaster victim
		identification (DVI), as described in Vigeland and Egeland
		(2021) doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-296414/v1. Identification is
		performed by optimising the joint likelihood of all victim
		samples and reference individuals. Individual identification
		probabilities, conditional on all available information, are
		derived from the joint solution in the form of posterior
		pairing probabilities. 'dvir' is part of the 'ped suite'
		collection of packages for pedigree analysis. In particular it
		uses 'forrel' for calculation of likelihood ratios.
