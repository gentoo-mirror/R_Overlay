		Disaster Victim Identification // Joint DNA-based disaster victim
		identification (DVI), as described in Vigeland and Egeland
		(2021) doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-296414/v1. Joint Victim
		identification is performed by optimising the joint likelihood
		of all genotyped individuals. Individual identification
		probabilities, conditional on all available information, are
		derived from the joint solution in the form of posterior
		pairing probabilities. 'dvir' is part of the 'ped suite'
		ecosystem for pedigree analysis, and relies in particular on
		'forrel' for computation of likelihood ratios.
