		Generalized Hyperbolic Distribution and Its Special Cases //
		Detailed functionality for working with the univariate and
		multivariate Generalized Hyperbolic distribution and its
		special cases (Hyperbolic (hyp), Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG),
		Variance Gamma (VG), skewed Student-t and Gaussian
		distribution). Especially, it contains fitting procedures, an
		AIC-based model selection routine, and functions for the
		computation of density, quantile, probability, random variates,
		expected shortfall and some portfolio optimization and plotting
		routines as well as the likelihood ratio test. In addition, it
		contains the Generalized Inverse Gaussian distribution. See
		Chapter 3 of A. J. McNeil, R. Frey, and P. Embrechts.
