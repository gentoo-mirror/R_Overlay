		Blood Pressure Device Accuracy Evaluation: Statistical
		Considerations // A comprehensive statistical analysis of the
		accuracy of blood pressure devices based on the method of
		AAMI/ANSI SP10 standards developed by the AAMI Sphygmomanometer
		Committee for indirect measurement of blood pressure,
		incorporated into IS0 81060-2. The 'bpAcc' package gives the
		exact probability 'of accepting a device D' derived from the
		join distribution of the sample standard deviation and a non-
		linear transformation of the sample mean for a specified sample
		size introduced by Chandel et al. (2023) and by the Association
		for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (2003,
		ISBN:1-57020-183-8).
