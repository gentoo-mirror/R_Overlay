		Generalized Application of Co-Occurrence Matrices and Haralick
		Texture // Generalizes application of gray-level co-occurrence
		matrix (GLCM) metrics to objects outside of images. The current
		focus is to apply GLCM metrics to the study of biological
		networks and fitness landscapes that are used in studying
		evolutionary medicine and biology, particularly the evolution
		of cancer resistance. The package was developed as part of the
		author's publication in Physics in Medicine and Biology Barker-
		Clarke et al. (2023) doi:10.1088/1361-6560/ace305. A general
		reference to learn more about mathematical oncology can be
		found at Rockne et al. (2019) doi:10.1088/1478-3975/ab1a09.
