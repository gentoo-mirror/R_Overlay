		Linkage Analysis in Outcrossing Polyploids // Creation of linkage
		maps in polyploid species from marker dosage scores of an F1
		cross from two heterozygous parents. Currently works for
		outcrossing diploid, autotriploid, autotetraploid and
		autohexaploid species, as well as segmental allotetraploids.
		Methods are described in a manuscript of Bourke et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty371.
