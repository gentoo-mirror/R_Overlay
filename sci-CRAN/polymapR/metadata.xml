		Linkage Analysis in Outcrossing Polyploids // Creation of linkage
		maps in polyploid species from marker dosage scores of an F1
		cross from two heterozygous parents. Currently works for
		autotriploid, autotetraploid and autohexaploid species, as well
		as segmental allotetraploids. Methods are described in a
		preprint manuscript of Bourke et al. (2017) doi:10.1101/228817.
