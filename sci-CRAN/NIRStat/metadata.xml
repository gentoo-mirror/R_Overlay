		Novel Statistical Methods for Studying Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
		(NIRS) Time Series Data // Provides transfusion-related
		differential tests on Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) time
		series with detection limit, which contains two testing
		statistics: Mean Area Under the Curve (MAUC) and slope
		statistic. This package applied a penalized spline method
		within imputation setting. Testing is conducted by a nested
		permutation approach within imputation. Refer to Guo et al
		(2018) doi:10.1177/0962280218786302 for further details.
