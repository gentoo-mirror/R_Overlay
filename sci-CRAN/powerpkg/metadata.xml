		Power Analyses for the Affected Sib Pair and the TDT Design //
		There are two main functions: (1) To estimate the power of
		testing for linkage using an affected sib pair design, as a
		function of the recurrence risk ratios. We will use analytical
		power formulae as implemented in R. These are based on a
		Mathematica notebook created by Martin Farrall. (2) To examine
		how the power of the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT)
		depends on the disease allele frequency, the marker allele
		frequency, the strength of the linkage disequilibrium, and the
		magnitude of the genetic effect. We will use an R program that
		implements the power formulae of Abel and Muller-Myhsok (1998).
		These formulae allow one to quickly compute power of the TDT
		approach under a variety of different conditions. This R
		program was modeled on Martin Farrall's Mathematica notebook.
