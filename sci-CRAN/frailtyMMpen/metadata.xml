		Efficient Algorithm for High-Dimensional Frailty Model // The
		penalized and non-penalized Minorize-Maximization (MM) method
		for frailty models to fit the clustered data, multi-event data
		and recurrent data. Least absolute shrinkage and selection
		operator (LASSO), minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly
		clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalized functions are
		implemented. All the methods are computationally efficient.
		These general methods are proposed based on the following
		papers, Huang, Xu and Zhou (2022) doi:10.3390/math10040538,
		Huang, Xu and Zhou (2023) doi:10.1177/09622802221133554.
