		A Test Environment for HTTP Requests // Testing and documenting
		code that communicates with remote servers can be painful.
		Dealing with authentication, server state, and other
		complications can make testing seem too costly to bother with.
		But it doesn't need to be that hard. This package enables one
		to test all of the logic on the R sides of the API in your
		package without requiring access to the remote service.
		Importantly, it provides three contexts that mock the network
		connection in different ways, as well as testing functions to
		assert that HTTP requests were---or were not---made. It also
		allows one to safely record real API responses to use as test
		fixtures. The ability to save responses and load them offline
		also enables one to write vignettes and other dynamic documents
		that can be distributed without access to a live server.
