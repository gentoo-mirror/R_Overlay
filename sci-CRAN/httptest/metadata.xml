		A Test Environment for HTTP Requests // Testing code and packages
		that communicate with remote servers can be painful. Dealing
		with authentication, bootstrapping server state, cleaning up
		objects that may get created during the test run, network
		flakiness, and other complications can make testing seem too
		costly to bother with. But it doesn't need to be that hard.
		This package enables one to test all of the logic on the R
		sides of the API in your package without requiring access to
		the remote service. Importantly, it provides three test
		contexts that mock the network connection in different ways,
		and it offers additional expectations to assert that HTTP
		requests were--or were not--made. It also allows you to record
		real API responses to use as mocks in tests. With these tools,
		one can test that code is making the intended requests and that
		it handles the expected responses correctly, all without
		depending on a connection to a remote API.
