		Quantifying Performance of a Binary Classifier Through Weight of
		Evidence // The distributions of the weight of evidence (log
		Bayes factor) favouring case over noncase status in a test
		dataset (or test folds generated by cross-validation) can be
		used to quantify the performance of a diagnostic test (McKeigue
		P., Quantifying performance of a diagnostic test as the
		expected information for discrimination: relation to the
		C-statistic. Statistical Methods for Medical Research 2018, in
		press). The package can be used with any test dataset on which
		you have observed case-control status and have computed prior
		and posterior probabilities of case status using a model
		learned on a training dataset. To quantify how the predictor
		will behave as a risk stratifier, the quantiles of the
		distributions of weight of evidence in cases and controls can
		be calculated and plotted.
