		Quantifying Performance of a Binary Classifier Through Weight of
		Evidence // The distributions of the weight of evidence (log
		Bayes factor) favouring case over noncase status in a test
		dataset (or test folds generated by cross-validation) can be
		used to quantify the performance of a diagnostic test (McKeigue
		(2018), doi:10.1177/0962280218776989). The package can be used
		with any test dataset on which you have observed case-control
		status and have computed prior and posterior probabilities of
		case status using a model learned on a training dataset. To
		quantify how the predictor will behave as a risk stratifier,
		the quantiles of the distributions of weight of evidence in
		cases and controls can be calculated and plotted.
