		Preprocessing Experience Sampling Method (ESM) Data // Tailored
		explicitly for Experience Sampling Method (ESM) data, it
		contains a suite of functions designed to simplify
		preprocessing steps and create subsequent reporting. It
		empowers users with capabilities to extract critical insights
		during preprocessing, conducts thorough data quality
		assessments (e.g., design and sampling scheme checks,
		compliance rate, careless responses), and generates
		visualizations and concise summary tables tailored specifically
		for ESM data. Additionally, it streamlines the creation of
		informative and interactive preprocessing reports, enabling
		researchers to transparently share their dataset preprocessing
		methodologies. Finally, it is part of a larger ecosystem which
		includes a framework and a web gallery
		(https://preprocess.esmtools.com/).
