		Fast Imputations Using 'Rcpp' and 'Armadillo' // Fast imputations
		under the object-oriented programming paradigm. Moreover there
		are offered a few functions built to work with popular R
		packages such as 'data.table' or 'dplyr'. The biggest
		improvement in time performance could be achieve for a
		calculation where a grouping variable have to be used. A single
		evaluation of a quantitative model for the multiple imputations
		is another major enhancement. A new major improvement is one of
		the fastest predictive mean matching in the R world because of
		presorting and binary search.
