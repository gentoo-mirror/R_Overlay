		Statistical Test App with R 'shiny' // Provides a user-friendly R
		'shiny' app for performing various statistical tests on
		datasets. It allows users to upload data in numerous formats
		and perform statistical analyses. The app dynamically adapts
		its options based on the selected columns and supports both
		single and multiple column comparisons. The app's user
		interface is designed to streamline the process of selecting
		datasets, columns, and test options, making it easy for users
		to explore and interpret their data. The underlying functions
		for statistical tests are well-organized and can be used
		independently within other R scripts.
