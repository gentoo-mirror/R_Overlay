		Variance-Covariance Matrices and Standard Errors // Methods for
		faster extraction (about 5x faster in a few test cases) of
		variance-covariance matrices and standard errors from models.
		Methods in the 'stats' package tend to rely on the summary
		method, which may waste time computing other summary statistics
		which are summarily ignored.
