		Nonlinear Time Series Models with Regime Switching // Implements
		nonlinear autoregressive (AR) time series models. For
		univariate series, a non-parametric approach is available
		through additive nonlinear AR. Parametric modeling and testing
		for regime switching dynamics is available when the transition
		is either direct (TAR: threshold AR) or smooth (STAR: smooth
		transition AR, LSTAR). For multivariate series, one can
		estimate a range of TVAR or threshold cointegration TVECM
		models with two or three regimes. Tests can be conducted for
		TVAR as well as for TVECM (Hansen and Seo 2002 and Seo 2006).
