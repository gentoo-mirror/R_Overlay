		Covariates, Interaction, and Selection for DGLM // An
		implementation of double generalized linear model (DGLM)
		building with variable selection procedures and handling of
		interaction terms and other complex situations. We also provide
		a method of handling convergence issues within the dglm()
		function. The package offers a simulation function for
		generating simulated data for testing purposes and utilizes the
		forward stepwise variable selection procedure in model-
		building. It also provides a new custom bootstrap function for
		mean and standard deviation estimation and functions for
		building crossplots and squareplots from a data set.
