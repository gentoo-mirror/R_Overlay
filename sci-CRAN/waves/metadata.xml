		Vis-NIR Spectral Analysis Wrapper // Originally designed
		application in the context of resource-limited plant research
		and breeding programs, 'waves' provides an open-source solution
		to spectral data processing and model development by bringing
		useful packages together into a streamlined pipeline.  This
		package is wrapper for functions related to the analysis of
		point visible and near-infrared reflectance measurements. It
		includes visualization, filtering, aggregation, preprocessing,
		cross-validation set formation, model training, and prediction
		functions to enable open-source association of spectral and
		reference data. This package is documented in a peer-reviewed
		manuscript in the Plant Phenome Journal doi:10.1002/ppj2.20012.
		Specialized cross-validation schemes are described in detail in
		Jarqun et al. (2017) doi:10.3835/plantgenome2016.12.0130.
		Example data is from Ikeogu et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0188918.
