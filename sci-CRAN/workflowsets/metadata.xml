		Create a Collection of 'tidymodels' Workflows // A workflow is a
		combination of a model and preprocessors (e.g, a formula,
		recipe, etc.) (Kuhn and Silge (2021) https://www.tmwr.org/). In
		order to try different combinations of these, an object can be
		created that contains many workflows. There are functions to
		create workflows en masse as well as training them and
		visualizing the results.
