		Sequential Invariant Causal Prediction // Contains an
		implementation of invariant causal prediction for sequential
		data. The main function in the package is 'seqICP', which
		performs linear sequential invariant causal prediction and has
		guaranteed type I error control. For non-linear dependencies
		the package also contains a non-linear method 'seqICPnl', which
		allows to input any regression procedure and performs tests
		based on a permutation approach that is only approximately
		correct. In order to test whether an individual set S is
		invariant the package contains the subroutines 'seqICP.s' and
		'seqICPnl.s' corresponding to the respective main methods.
