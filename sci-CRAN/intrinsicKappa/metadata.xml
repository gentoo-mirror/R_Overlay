		Sample Size Planning Based on Intrinsic Kappa Value // Kappa
		statistics is one of the most used methods to evaluate the
		effectiveness of inpsections based on attribute assessments in
		industry. However, its estimation by available methods does not
		provide its "real" or "intrinstic" value. This package provides
		functions for the computation of the intrinsic kappa value as
		it is described in: Rafael Sanchez-Marquez, Frank Gerhorst and
		David Schindler (2023) "Effectiveness of quality inspections of
		attributive characteristics  A novel and practical method for
		estimating the intrinsic value of kappa based on alpha and beta
		statistics." doi:10.1016/j.cie.2023.109006.
