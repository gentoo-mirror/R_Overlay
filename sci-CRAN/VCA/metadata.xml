		Variance Component Analysis // ANOVA-type estimation (prediction)
		of random effects in linear mixed models is implemented,
		following Searle et al. 1991 (ANOVA for unbalanced data). For
		better performance the SWEEP-Operator is now implemented for
		generating the ANOVA Type-1 error sum of squares. The primary
		objective of this package is to perform Variance Component
		Analyses (VCA). This is a special type of analysis frequently
		used in verifying the precision performance of diagnostics. The
		Satterthwaite approximation of the total degrees of freedom and
		for individual variance components is implemented. These are
		used in the Chi-Squared tests against a claimed value, and in
		the respective confidence intervals. Satterthwaite's
		approximation of denominator degrees of freedom in t-/F-tests
		of fixed effects are also available. There are several
		functions for extracting, random effects, fixed effects,
		variance-covariance matrices of random and fixed effects.
		Residuals (marginal, conditional) can be extracted as raw,
		standardized and studentized residuals. Additionally, plotting
		methods for residuals and random effects and a variability
		chart are available. The latter is useful for visualizing the
		variability in sub-classes emerging from the experimental
		design.
