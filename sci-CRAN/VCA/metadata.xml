		Variance Component Analysis // ANOVA and REML estimation of
		linear mixed models is implemented, once following Searle et
		al. (1991, ANOVA for unbalanced data), once making use of the
		'lme4' package. The primary objective of this package is to
		perform a variance component analysis (VCA) according to CLSI
		EP05-A3 guideline "Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative
		Measurement Procedures" (2014). There are plotting methods for
		visualization of an experimental design, plotting random
		effects and residuals. For ANOVA type estimation two methods
		for computing ANOVA mean squares are implemented (SWEEP and
		quadratic forms). The covariance matrix of variance components
		can be derived, which is used in estimating confidence
		intervals. Linear hypotheses of fixed effects and LS means can
		be computed. LS means can be computed at specific values of
		covariables and with custom weighting schemes for factor
		variables. See ?VCA for a more comprehensive description of the
		features.
