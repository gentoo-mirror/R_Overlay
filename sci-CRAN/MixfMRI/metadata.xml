		Mixture fMRI Clustering Analysis // Utilizing model-based
		clustering (unsupervised) for functional magnetic resonance
		imaging (fMRI) data. The developed methods (Chen and Maitra
		(2018, manuscript)) include 2D and 3D clustering analyses (for
		p-values with voxel locations) and segmentation analyses (for
		p-values alone) for fMRI data where p-values indicate
		significant level of activation responding to stimulate of
		interesting. The analyses are mainly identifying active
		voxel/signal associated with normal brain behaviors. Analysis
		pipelines (R scripts) utilizing this package (see examples in
		'inst/workflow/') is also implemented with high performance
		techniques.
