		Identification of the Factors Affecting Species Richness // It
		identifies the factors significantly related to species
		richness, and their relative contribution, using multiple
		regressions and support vector machine models. It uses an
		output file of 'ModestR' with data of richness of the species
		and environmental variables in a cell size defined by the user.
		The residuals of the support vector machine model are shown on
		a map. Negative residuals may be potential areas with
		undiscovered and/or unregistered species, or areas with
		decreased species richness due to the negative effect of
		anthropogenic factors.
