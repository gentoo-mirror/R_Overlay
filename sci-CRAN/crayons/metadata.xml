		Color Palettes from Crayon Boxes // Provides color palettes based
		on crayon colors since the early 1900s. Colors are based on
		various crayon colors, sets, and promotional palettes, most of
		which can be found at
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors.
		All palettes are discrete palettes and are not necessarily
		color-blind friendly. Provides scales for 'ggplot2' for
		discrete coloring.
