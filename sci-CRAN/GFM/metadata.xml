		Generalized Factor Model // Generalized factor model is
		implemented for ultra-high dimensional data with mixed-type
		variables. Two algorithms, variational EM and alternate
		maximization, are designed to implement the generalized factor
		model, respectively. The factor matrix and loading matrix
		together with the number of factors can be well estimated. This
		model can be employed in social and behavioral sciences,
		economy and finance, and  genomics, to extract interpretable
		nonlinear factors. More details can be referred to Wei Liu,
		Huazhen Lin, Shurong Zheng and Jin Liu. (2021)
