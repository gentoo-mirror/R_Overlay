		A Spatial Model of Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity // Implements a
		three-dimensional stochastic model of cancer growth and
		mutation similar to the one described in Waclaw et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1038/nature14971. Allows for interactive 3D
		visualizations of the simulated tumor. Provides a comprehensive
		summary of the spatial distribution of mutants within the
		tumor. Contains functions which create synthetic sequencing
		datasets from the generated tumor.
