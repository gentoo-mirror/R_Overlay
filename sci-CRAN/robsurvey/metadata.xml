		Robust Survey Statistics Estimation // Multiple functions to
		compute robust survey statistics. The package supports the
		computations of robust means, totals, and ratios. Available
		methods are Huber M-estimators, trimming, and winsorization.
		The package 'robsurvey' complements the 'survey' package. The
		package additionally includes a weighted version of the
		resistant line function of base R (line()), as well as two
		median based simple regression estimators. The methods are
		described in Hulliger (1995) https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en
		/catalogue/12-001-X199500114407/.
