		Transport Accessibility Metrics // A set of fast and convenient
		functions to calculate multiple transport accessibility
		measures. Given a pre-computed travel cost matrix in long
		format combined with land-use  data (e.g. location of  jobs,
		healthcare, population), the package  allows one to calculate
		active and passive accessibility levels using multiple
		accessibility metrics such as: cumulative opportunity measure
		(using either travel time cutoff or interval), minimum travel
		cost to closest N number of activities, gravitational measures
		and different floating catchment area methods.
