		Transport Accessibility Measures // A set of fast and convenient
		functions to calculate multiple transport accessibility
		measures. Given a pre-computed travel cost matrix and a land
		use dataset (containing the location of jobs, healthcare and
		population, for example), the package allows one to calculate
		active and passive accessibility levels using multiple
		accessibility measures, such as: cumulative opportunities
		(using either travel cost cutoffs or intervals), minimum travel
		cost to closest N number of activities, gravity-based (with
		different decay functions) and different floating catchment
		area methods.
