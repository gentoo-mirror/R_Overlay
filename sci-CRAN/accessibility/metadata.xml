		Transport Accessibility Measures // A set of fast and convenient
		functions to help conducting accessibility analyses. Given a
		pre-computed travel cost matrix and a land use dataset
		(containing the location of jobs, healthcare and population,
		for example), the package allows one to calculate accessibility
		levels and accessibility poverty and inequality. The package
		covers the majority of the most commonly used accessibility
		measures (such as cumulative opportunities, gravity-based and
		floating catchment areas methods), as well as the most
		frequently used inequality and poverty metrics (such as the
		Palma ratio, the concentration and Theil indices and the FGT
		family of measures).
