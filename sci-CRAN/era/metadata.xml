		Year-Based Time Scales // Provides a consistent representation of
		year-based time scales as a numeric vector with an associated
		'era'. There are built-in era definitions for many year
		numbering systems used in contemporary and historic calendars
		(e.g. Common Era, Islamic 'Hijri' years); year-based time
		scales used in archaeology, astronomy, geology, and other
		palaeosciences (e.g. Before Present, SI-prefixed 'annus'); and
		support for arbitrary user-defined eras. Years can converted
		from any one era to another using a generalised transformation
		function. Methods are also provided for robust casting and
		coercion between years and other numeric types, type-stable
		arithmetic with years, and pretty-printing in tables.
