		Years with an Era // Provides a consistent vector representation
		of years with an associated calendar era or time scale. It
		includes built-in definitions of many contemporary and historic
		calendars; time scales commonly used in archaeology, astronomy,
		geology, and other palaeosciences (e.g. Before Present, SI-
		prefixed 'annus'); and support for arbitrary user-defined eras.
		Functions for converting between eras and for type-stable
		arithmetic with years are also provided.
