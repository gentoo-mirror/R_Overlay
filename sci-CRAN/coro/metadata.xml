		'Coroutines' for R // Provides 'coroutines' for R, a family of
		functions that can be suspended and resumed later on. This
		includes 'async' functions (which await) and generators (which
		yield). 'Async' functions are based on the concurrency
		framework of the 'promises' package. Generators are based on a
		dependency free iteration protocol defined in 'coro' and are
		compatible with iterators from the 'reticulate' package.
