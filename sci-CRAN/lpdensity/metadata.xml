		Local Polynomial Density Estimation and Inference // Without
		imposing stringent distributional assumptions or shape
		restrictions, nonparametric estimation has been popular in
		economics and other social sciences for counterfactual
		analysis, program evaluation, and policy recommendations. This
		package implements a novel density (and derivatives) estimator
		based on local polynomial regressions, documented in Cattaneo,
		Jansson and Ma (2022) doi:10.18637/jss.v101.i02: lpdensity() to
		construct local polynomial based density (and derivatives)
		estimator, and lpbwdensity() to perform data-driven bandwidth
		selection.
