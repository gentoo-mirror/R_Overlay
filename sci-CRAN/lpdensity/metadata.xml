		Local Polynomial Density Estimation and Inference // Without
		imposing stringent distributional assumptions or shape
		restrictions, nonparametric density estimation has been popular
		in economics and other social sciences for counterfactual
		analysis, program evaluation, and policy recommendations. This
		package implements a novel density estimator based on local
		polynomial regression, documented in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma
		(2017): lpdensity() to construct local polynomial based density
		(and derivatives) estimator; lpbwdensity() to perform data-
		driven bandwidth selection; and lpdensity.plot() for density
		plot with robust confidence interval.
