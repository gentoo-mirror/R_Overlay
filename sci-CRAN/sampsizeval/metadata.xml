		Sample Size for Validation of Risk Models with Binary Outcomes //
		Estimation of the required sample size to validate a risk model
		for binary outcomes, based on the sample size equations
		proposed by Pavlou et al. (2021) doi:10.1177/09622802211007522.
		For precision-based sample size calculations, the user is
		required to enter the anticipated values of the C-statistic and
		outcome prevalence, which can be obtained from a previous
		study. The user also needs to specify the required precision
		(standard error) for the C-statistic, the calibration slope and
		the calibration in the large. The calculations are valid under
		the assumption of marginal normality for the distribution of
		the linear predictor.
