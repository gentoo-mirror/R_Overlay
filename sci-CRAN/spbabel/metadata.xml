		Convert Spatial Data Using Tidy Tables // Tools to convert from
		specific formats to more general forms of spatial data. Using
		tables to store the actual entities present in spatial data
		provides flexibility, and the functions here deliberately
		minimize the level of interpretation applied, leaving that for
		specific applications. Includes support for simple features,
		round-trip for 'Spatial' classes and long-form tables,
		analogous to 'ggplot2::fortify'. There is also a more 'normal
		form' representation that decomposes simple features and their
		kin to tables of objects, parts, and unique coordinates.
