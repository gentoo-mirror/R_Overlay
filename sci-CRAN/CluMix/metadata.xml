		Clustering and Visualization of Mixed-Type Data // Provides
		utilities for clustering subjects and variables of mixed data
		types. Similarities between subjects are measured by Gower's
		general similarity coefficient with an extension of Podani for
		ordinal variables. Similarities between variables can be
		assessed i) by combination of appropriate measures of
		association for different pairs of data types or ii) based on
		distance correlation. Alternatively, variables can also be
		clustered by the 'ClustOfVar' approach. The main feature of the
		package is the generation of a mixed-data heatmap. For
		visualizing similarities between either subjects or variables,
		a heatmap of the corresponding distance matrix can be drawn.
		Associations between variables can be explored by a 'confounder
		plot', which allows visual detection of possible confounding,
		collinear, or surrogate factors for some variables of primary
		interest. Distance matrices and dendrograms for subjects and
		variables can be derived and used for further visualizations
		and applications. This work was supported by BMBF grant
		01ZX1609B, Germany.
