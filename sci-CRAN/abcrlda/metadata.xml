		Asymptotically Bias-Corrected Regularized Linear Discriminant
		Analysis // Offers methods to perform asymptotically bias-
		corrected regularized linear discriminant analysis (ABC_RLDA)
		for cost-sensitive binary classification. The bias-correction
		is an estimate of the bias term added to regularized
		discriminant analysis (RLDA) that minimizes the overall risk.
		The default magnitude of misclassification costs are equal and
		set to 0.5; however, the package also offers the options to set
		them to some predetermined values or, alternatively, take them
		as hyperparameters to tune. A. Zollanvari, M. Abdirash, A.
		Dadlani and B. Abibullaev (2019) doi:10.1109/LSP.2019.2918485.
