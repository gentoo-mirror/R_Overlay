		A Statistically Sound 'data.frame' Processor/Conditioner // A
		'data.frame' processor/conditioner that prepares real-world
		data for predictive modeling in a statistically sound manner.
		'vtreat' prepares variables so that data has fewer exceptional
		cases, making it easier to safely use models in production.
		Common problems 'vtreat' defends against: 'Inf', 'NA', too many
		categorical levels, rare categorical levels, and new
		categorical levels (levels seen during application, but not
		during training). 'vtreat::prepare' should be used as you would
		use 'model.matrix'.
