		Vectorised Probability Distributions // Vectorised distribution
		objects with tools for manipulating, visualising, and using
		probability distributions. Designed to allow model prediction
		outputs to return distributions rather than their parameters,
		allowing users to directly interact with predictive
		distributions in a data-oriented workflow. In addition to
		providing generic replacements for p/d/q/r functions, other
		useful statistics can be computed including means, variances,
		intervals, and highest density regions.
