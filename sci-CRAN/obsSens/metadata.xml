		Sensitivity Analysis for Observational Studies // Observational
		studies are limited in that there could be an unmeasured
		variable related to both the response variable and the primary
		predictor.  If this unmeasured variable were included in the
		analysis it would change the relationship (possibly changing
		the conclusions).  Sensitivity analysis is a way to see how
		much of a relationship needs to exist with the unmeasured
		variable before the conclusions change.  This package provides
		tools for doing a sensitivity analysis for regression (linear,
		logistic, and cox) style models.
