		Framework for Specifying and Simulating Individual Based Models
		// A framework which provides users a set of useful primitive
		elements for specifying individual based simulation models,
		with special attention models for infectious disease
		epidemiology. Users build models by specifying variables for
		each characteristic of individuals in the simulated population
		by using data structures exposed by the package. The package
		provides efficient methods for finding subsets of individuals
		based on these variables, or cohorts. Cohorts can then be
		targeted for variable updates or scheduled for events. Variable
		updates queued during a time step are executed at the end of a
		discrete time step, and the code places no restrictions on how
		individuals are allowed to interact. These data structures are
		designed to provide an intuitive way for users to turn their
		conceptual model of a system into executable code, which is
		fast and memory efficient.
