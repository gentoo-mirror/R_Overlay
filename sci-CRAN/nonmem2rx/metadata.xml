		Converts 'NONMEM' Models to 'rxode2' // 'NONMEM' has been a tool
		for running nonlinear mixed effects models since the 80s and is
		still used today (Bauer 2019 doi:10.1002/psp4.12404). This tool
		allows you to convert 'NONMEM' models to 'rxode2' (Wang, Hallow
		and James (2016) doi:10.1002/psp4.12052) and with simple models
		'nlmixr2' syntax (Fidler et al (2019) doi:10.1002/psp4.12445).
		The 'nlmixr2' syntax requires the residual specification to be
		included and it is not always translated. If available, the
		'rxode2' model will read in the 'NONMEM' data and compare the
		simulation for the population model ('PRED') individual model
		('IPRED') and residual model ('IWRES') to immediately show how
		well the translation is performing. This saves the model
		development time for people who are creating an 'rxode2' model
		manually.  Additionally, this package reads in all the
		information to allow simulation with uncertainty (that is the
		number of observations, the number of subjects, and the
		covariance matrix) with a 'rxode2' model.  This is
		complementary to the 'babelmixr2' package that translates
		'nlmixr2' models to 'NONMEM' and can convert the objects
		converted from 'nonmem2rx' to a full 'nlmixr2' fit.
