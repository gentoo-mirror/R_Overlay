		Beta Product Confidence Procedure for Right Censored Data //
		Calculates nonparametric pointwise confidence intervals for the
		survival distribution for right censored data, and for medians
		[Fay and Brittain DOI:10.1002/sim.6905]. Has two-sample tests
		for dissimilarity (e.g., difference, ratio or odds ratio) in
		survival at a fixed time, and differences in medians [Fay,
		Proschan, and Brittain DOI:10.1111/biom.12231]. Basically, the
		package gives exact inference methods for one- and two-sample
		exact inferences for Kaplan-Meier curves (e.g., generalizing
		Fisher's exact test to allow for right censoring), which are
		especially important for latter parts of the survival curve,
		small sample sizes or heavily censored data. Includes mid-p
		options.
