		Multiple-Output Directional Quantile Regression // Contains basic
		tools for performing multiple-output quantile regression and
		computing regression quantile contours by means of directional
		regression quantiles. In the location case, one can thus obtain
		halfspace depth contours in two to six dimensions. Hallin, M.,
		Paindaveine, D. and iman, M. (2010) Multivariate quantiles and
		multiple-output regression quantiles: from L1 optimization to
		halfspace depth. Annals of Statistics 38, 635-669 For more
		references about the method, see Help pages.
