		Identification of the Most Influential Nodes // Contains
		functions for reconstruction of networks from adjacency
		matrices and data frames, analysis of the topology of the
		network and calculation of centrality measures, and
		identification of the most influential nodes. Also, some
		functions have been provided for the assessment of dependence
		and correlation of two network centrality measures as well as
		the conditional probability of deviation from their
		corresponding means in opposite direction. Fred Viole and David
		Nawrocki (2013, ISBN:1490523995). Csardi G, Nepusz T (2006).
