		Create a Mini Version of CRAN Containing Only Selected Packages
		// Makes it possible to create an internally consistent
		repository consisting of selected packages from CRAN-like
		repositories. The user specifies a set of desired packages, and
		'miniCRAN' recursively reads the dependency tree for these
		packages, then downloads only this subset. The user can then
		install packages from this repository directly, rather than
		from CRAN.  This is useful in production settings, e.g. server
		behind a firewall, or remote locations with slow (or zero)
		Internet access.
