		Speed Limiter to Control Rate of Execution of Loops // Speed
		limiter for controlling rate of execution of loops. It can be
		necessary to limit the rate of execution of a loop or repeated
		function call e.g. to show or gather data only at particular
		intervals. This package includes two methods for limiting this
		execution rate; speed governors and timers.  A speed governor
		will insert pauses during execution to meet a user-specified
		loop time.  Timers are alarm clocks which will indicate whether
		a certain time has passed.  These mechanisms are implemented in
		'C' to minimize processing overhead.
