		Basis Expansions for Regression Modeling // Provides various
		basis expansions for flexible regression modeling, including
		random Fourier features (Rahimi  Recht, 2007) https://proceedin
		gs.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2007/file/013a006f03dbc5392effe
		b8f18fda755-Paper.pdf, exact kernel / Gaussian process feature
		maps, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) (Chipman et
		al., 2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285 prior features, and a helpful
		interface for n-way interactions. The provided functions may be
		used within any modeling formula, allowing the use of kernel
		methods and other basis expansions in modeling functions that
		do not otherwise support them. Along with the basis expansions,
		a number of kernel functions are also provided, which support
		kernel arithmetic to form new kernels. Basic ridge regression
		functionality is included as well.
