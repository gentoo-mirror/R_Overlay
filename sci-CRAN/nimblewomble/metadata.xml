		Bayesian Wombling using 'nimble' // A software package to perform
		Wombling, or boundary analysis, using the 'nimble' Bayesian
		hierarchical modeling environment. Wombling is used widely to
		track regions of rapid change within the spatial reference
		domain. Specific functions in the package implement Gaussian
		process models for point-referenced spatial data followed by
		predictive inference on rates of change over curves using line
		integrals. We demonstrate model based Bayesian inference using
		posterior distributions featuring simple analytic forms while
		offering uncertainty quantification over curves. For more
		details on wombling please see, Banerjee and Gelfand (2006)

		(2024) doi:10.1080/01621459.2023.2177166.
