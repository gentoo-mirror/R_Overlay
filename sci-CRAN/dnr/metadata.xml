		Simulate Dynamic Networks using Exponential Random Graph Models
		(ERGM) Family // Functions are provided to fit temporal lag
		models to dynamic networks. The models are build on top of
		exponential random graph models (ERGM) framework. There are
		functions for simulating or forecasting networks for future
		time points. Stable Multiple Time Step Simulation/Prediction
		from Lagged Dynamic Network Regression Models. Mallik, Almquist
		(2017, under review).
