		EM Algorithm for Sigmoid Normal Model // It provides a method
		based on EM algorithm to estimate the parameter of a mixture
		model, Sigmoid-Normal Model, where the samples come from
		several normal distributions (also call them subgroups) whose
		mean is determined by co-variable Z and coefficient alpha while
		the variance are homogeneous. Meanwhile, the subgroup each item
		belongs to is determined by co-variables X and coefficient eta
		through Sigmoid link function which is the extension of
		Logistic Link function. It uses bootstrap to estimate the
		standard error of parameters. When sample is indeed separable,
		removing estimation with abnormal sigma, the estimation of
		alpha is quite well. I used this method to explore the subgroup
		structure of HIV patients and it can be used in other domains
		where exists subgroup structure.
