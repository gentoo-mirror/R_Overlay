		Control Number of OpenMP Threads Dynamically // The
		OpenMPController package provides a function
		omp_set_num_threads() to set the number of OpenMP threads to be
		used. This may be useful, for example, when linking against a
		vendor optimised BLAS/LAPACK library (e.g. the AMD Core Math
		Library), since the defaults used by those libraries may not be
		highly performant.
