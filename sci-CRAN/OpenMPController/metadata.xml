		Control number of OpenMP threads dynamically // The
		OpenMPController package provides a function
		'omp_set_num_threads()' to set the number of OpenMP threads to
		be used.  This may be useful, for example, when linking against
		a vendor optimised BLAS/LAPACK library (e.g. the AMD Core Math
		Library), since the defaults used by those libraries may not be
		highly performant.
