		Streaming Events and their Early Classification // Implements
		event extraction and early classification of events in data
		streams in R. It has the functionality to generate
		2-dimensional data streams with events belonging to 2 classes.
		These events can be extracted and features computed. The event
		features extracted from incomplete-events can be classified
		using a partial-observations-classifier (Kandanaarachchi et al.
