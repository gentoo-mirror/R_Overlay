		Compute the Personalized Activity Index Based on a Negative
		Binomial Model // The functions in this package implement the
		safety monitoring procedures proposed in the paper titled
		"Detection of unusual increases in MRI lesion counts in
		individual multiple sclerosis patients" by Zhao, Y., Li,
		D.K.B., Petkau, A.J., Riddehough, A., Traboulsee, A., published
		in Journal of the American Statistical Association in 2013. The
		procedure first models longitudinally collected count variables
		with a negative binomial mixed-effect regression model. To
		account for the correlation among repeated measures from the
		same patient, the model has subject-specific random intercept,
		which can be modelled with a gamma or log-normal distributions.
		One can also choose the semi-parametric option which does not
		assume any distribution for the random effect. These mixed-
		effect models could be useful beyond the application of the
		safety monitoring. The maximum likelihood methods are used to
		estimate the unknown fixed effect parameters of the model.
		Based on the fitted model, the personalized activity index is
		computed for each patient. Lastly, this package is companion to
		R package lmeNBBayes, which contains the functions to compute
		the Personalized Activity Index in Bayesian framework.
