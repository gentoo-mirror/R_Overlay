		A Simpler Way to Find Your Files // Constructs paths to your
		project's files. The 'here()' function uses a reasonable
		heuristics to find your project's files, based on the current
		working directory at the time when the package is loaded. Use
		it as a drop-in replacement for 'file.path()', it will always
		locate the files relative to your project root.
