		Zooarchaeological Analysis with Log-Ratios // Includes functions
		and reference data to generate and manipulate log-ratios (also
		known as log size index (LSI) values) from measurements
		obtained on zooarchaeological material. Log ratios are used to
		compare the relative (rather than the absolute) dimensions of
		animals from archaeological contexts (Meadow 1999, ISBN:
		9783896463883). zoolog is also able to seamlessly integrate
		data and references with heterogeneous nomenclature, which is
		internally managed by a zoolog thesaurus. A preliminary version
		of the zoolog methods was first used by Trentacoste, Nieto-
		Espinet, and Valenzuela-Lamas (2018)
