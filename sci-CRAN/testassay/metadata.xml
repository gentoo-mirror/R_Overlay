		A Hypothesis Testing Framework for Validating an Assay for
		Precision // A common way of validating a biological assay for
		is through a procedure, where m levels of an analyte are
		measured with n replicates at each level, and if all m
		estimates of the coefficient of variation (CV) are less than
		some prespecified level, then the assay is declared validated
		for precision within the range of the m analyte levels. Two
		limitations of this procedure are: there is no clear
		statistical statement of precision upon passing, and it is
		unclear how to modify the procedure for assays with constant
		standard deviation. We provide tools to convert such a
		procedure into a set of m hypothesis tests. This reframing
		motivates the m:n:q procedure, which upon completion delivers a
		100q% upper confidence limit on the CV. Additionally, for a
		post-validation assay output of y, the method gives an
		``effective standard deviation interval'' of log(y) plus or
		minus r, which is a 68% confidence interval on log(mu), where
		mu is the expected value of the assay output for that sample.
		Further, the m:n:q procedure can be straightforwardly applied
		to constant standard deviation assays. We illustrate these
		tools by applying them to a growth inhibition assay.
