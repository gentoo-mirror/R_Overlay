		Complexity of Short and Coarse-Grained Time Series // While there
		are many well-established measures for identifying critical
		fluctuations and phase transitions, these measures only work
		with many points of measurement and thus are unreliable when
		studying short and coarse-grained time series. This package
		provides a measure for complexity in a time series that does
		not rely on long time series (Kaiser (2017),
		doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/GWTKX).
