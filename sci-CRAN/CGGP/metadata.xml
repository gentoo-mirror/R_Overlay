		Composite Grid Gaussian Processes // Run computer experiments
		using the adaptive composite grid algorithm with a Gaussian
		process model. The algorithm works best when running an
		experiment that can evaluate thousands of points from a
		deterministic computer simulation. This package is an
		implementation of a forthcoming paper by Plumlee, Erickson,
		Ankenman, et al. For a preprint of the paper, contact the
		maintainer of this package.
