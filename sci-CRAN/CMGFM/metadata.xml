		Covariate-Augumented Generalized Factor Model // Covariate-
		augumented generalized factor model is designed to account for
		cross-modal heterogeneity, capture nonlinear dependencies among
		the data, incorporate additional information, and provide
		excellent interpretability while maintaining high computational
		efficiency.
