		Soil Quality Index // The overall performance of soil ecosystem
		services and productivity greatly relies on soil health, making
		it a crucial indicator. The evaluation of soil physical,
		chemical, and biological parameters is necessary to determine
		the overall soil quality index. In our package, three commonly
		used methods, including linear scoring, regression-based, and
		principal component-based soil quality indexing, are employed
		to calculate the soil quality index. This package has been
		developed using concept of Bastida et al. (2008) and Doran and
		Parkin (1994) doi:10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.08.007
		doi:10.2136/sssaspecpub35.c1.
