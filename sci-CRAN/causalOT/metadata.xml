		Optimal Transport Weights for Causal Inference // Uses optimal
		transport distances to find probabilistic matching estimators
		for causal inference. These methods are described in Dunipace,
		Eric (2021) arXiv:2109.01991. The package will build the
		weights, estimate treatment effects, and calculate confidence
		intervals via the methods described in the paper. The package
		also supports several other methods as described in the help
		files.
