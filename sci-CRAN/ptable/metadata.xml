		Generation of Perturbation Tables for the Cell-Key Method //
		Tabular data from statistical institutes and agencies are
		mostly confidential and must be protected prior to
		publications. The cell-key method is a post-tabular Statistical
		Disclosure Control perturbation technique that adds random
		noise to tabular data. The statistical properties of the
		perturbations are defined by some noise probability
		distributions - also referred to as perturbation tables. This
		tool can be used to create the perturbation tables based on a
		maximum entropy approach as described for example in Giessing
		(2016) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-45381-1_18. The perturbation
		tables created can finally be used to apply a cell-key method
		to frequency count or magnitude tables.
