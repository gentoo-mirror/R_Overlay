		A Visual Tool for Behavior Analysis over Time // A graphical R
		package designed to visualize behavioral observations over
		time. Based on raw time data extracted from video recorded
		sessions of experimental observations, ViSiElse grants a global
		overview of a process by combining the visualization of
		multiple actions timestamps for all participants in a single
		graph. Individuals and/or group behavior can easily be
		assessed. Supplementary features allow users to further inspect
		their data by adding summary statistics (mean, standard
		deviation, quantile or statistical test) and/or time
		constraints to assess the accuracy of the realized actions.
