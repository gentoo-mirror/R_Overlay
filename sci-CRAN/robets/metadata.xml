		Forecasting Time Series with Robust Exponential Smoothing // We
		provide an outlier robust alternative of the function ets() in
		the 'forecast' package of Hyndman and Khandakar
		(2008)DOI:10.18637/jss.v027.i03. For each method of a class of
		exponential smoothing variants we made a robust alternative.
		The class includes methods with a damped trend and/or seasonal
		components. The robust method is developed by robustifying
		every aspect of the original exponential smoothing variant. We
		provide robust forecasting equations, robust initial values,
		robust smoothing parameter estimation and a robust information
		criterion. The method is described in more detail in Crevits
		and Croux (2016)DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.11791.18080.
