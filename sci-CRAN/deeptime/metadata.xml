		Plotting Tools for Anyone Working in Deep Time // Extends the
		functionality of other plotting packages like 'ggplot2' and
		'lattice' to help facilitate the plotting of data over long
		time intervals, including, but not limited to, geological,
		evolutionary, and ecological data. The primary goal of
		'deeptime' is to enable users to add highly customizable
		timescales to their visualizations. Other functions are also
		included to assist with other areas of deep time visualization.
