		Nima Hejazi's R Toolbox // Miscellaneous R functions developed as
		collateral damage over the course of work in statistical and
		scientific computing for research. These include, for example,
		utilities that supplement existing idiosyncrasies of the R
		language, extend existing plotting functionality and
		aesthetics, help prepare data objects for imputation, and
		extend access to command line tools and systems-level
		information.
