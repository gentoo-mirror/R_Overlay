		Nima Hejazi's R Toolbox // Miscellaneous R functions developed
		over the course of statistical research and scientific
		computing. These include, for example, utilities that
		supplement the existing idiosyncrasies of the R language,
		extend existing plotting functionality and aesthetics, provide
		alternative presentations of matrix decompositions, and extend
		access to command line tools and systems-level information.
