		Contingency Measure-Based Networks for Binary Time Series // The
		ConNEcT approach investigates the pairwise association strength
		of binary time series by calculating contingency measures and
		depicts the results in a network. The package includes features
		to explore and visualize the data. To calculate the pairwise
		concurrent or temporal sequenced relationship between the
		variables, the package provides seven contingency measures
		(proportion of agreement, classical  corrected Jaccard, Cohen's
		kappa, phi correlation coefficient, odds ratio, and log odds
		ratio), however, others can easily be implemented. The package
		also includes non-parametric significance tests, that can be
		applied to test whether the contingency value quantifying the
		relationship between the variables is significantly higher than
		chance level. Most importantly this test accounts for auto-
		dependence and relative frequency.See Bodner et al.(2021) doi:
		10.1111/bmsp.12222.Finally, a network can be drawn. Variables
		depicted the nodes of the network, with the node size adapted
		to the prevalence. The association strength between the
		variables defines the undirected (concurrent) or directed
		(temporal sequenced) links between the nodes. The results of
		the non-parametric significance test can be included by
		depicting either all links or only the significant ones.
