		Fast Kalman Filter // This is a fast and flexible implementation
		of the Kalman filter and smoother, which can deal with NAs. It
		is entirely written in C and relies fully on linear algebra
		subroutines contained in BLAS and LAPACK. Due to the speed of
		the filter, the fitting of high-dimensional linear state space
		models to large datasets becomes possible. This package also
		contains a plot function for the visualization of the state
		vector and graphical diagnostics of the residuals.
