		Fast Kalman Filter // This is a fast and flexible implementation
		of the Kalman filter, which can deal with NAs. It is entirely
		written in C and relies fully on linear algebra subroutines
		contained in BLAS and LAPACK. Due to the speed of the filter,
		the fitting of high-dimensional linear state space models to
		large datasets becomes possible. This package also contains a
		plot function for the visualization of the state vector and
		graphical diagnostics of the residuals.
