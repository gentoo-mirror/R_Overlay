		Tools for Detecting Predatory Publishers and Journals // Allows
		the user to check and find (allegedly) predatory journals based
		on Beall's list available at https://scholarlyoa.com/. As part
		of a research project, the data from the website has been
		scraped with a web scraping script. The package includes a
		search function and direct access to this database of predatory
		journals. The use of this tool should facilitate the detection
		of predatory publications by researchers and librarians.
