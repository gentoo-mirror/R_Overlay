		Regularization Paths for Regression Models with Grouped
		Covariates // Efficient algorithms for fitting the
		regularization path of linear regression, GLM, and Cox
		regression models with grouped penalties.  This includes group
		selection methods such as group lasso, group MCP, and group
		SCAD as well as bi-level selection methods such as the group
		exponential lasso, the composite MCP, and the group bridge.
