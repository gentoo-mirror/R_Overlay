		Regularization Paths for Regression Models with Grouped
		Covariates // Efficient algorithms for fitting the
		regularization path of linear or logistic regression models
		with grouped penalties.  This includes group selection methods
		such as group lasso, group MCP, and group SCAD as well as bi-
		level selection methods such as the group exponential lasso,
		the composite MCP, and the group bridge.
