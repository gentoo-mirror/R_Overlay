		Declare when Suggested Packages are Needed // By adding
		dependencies to the "Suggests" field of a package's DESCRIPTION
		file, and then declaring that they are needed within any
		dependent functionality, it is often possible to significantly
		reduce the number of "hard" dependencies required by a package.
		This package provides a minimal way to declare when a suggested
		package is needed.
