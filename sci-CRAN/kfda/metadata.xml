		Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis // Kernel Fisher Discriminant
		Analysis (KFDA) is performed using Kernel Principal Component
		Analysis (KPCA) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA). There
		are some similar packages. First, 'lfda' is a package that
		performs Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA) and performs
		other functions. In particular, 'lfda' seems to be impossible
		to test because it needs the label information of the data in
		the function argument. Also, the 'ks' package has a limited
		dimension, which makes it difficult to analyze properly. This
		package is a simple and practical package for KFDA based on the
		paper of Yang, J., Jin, Z., Yang, J. Y., Zhang, D., and Frangi,
		A. F. (2004) DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2003.10.015.
