		Collection and Analysis of Otolith Shape Data // Studies otolith
		shape variation among fish populations. Otoliths are calcified
		structures found in the inner ear of teleost fish and their
		shape has been known to vary among several fish populations and
		stocks, making them very useful in taxonomy, species
		identification and to study geographic variations. The package
		extends previously described software used for otolith shape
		analysis by allowing the user to automatically extract closed
		contour outlines from a large number of images, perform
		smoothing to eliminate pixel noise described in Haines and
		Crampton (2000) doi:10.1111/1475-4983.00148, choose from
		conducting either a Fourier or wavelet see Genay et al (2001)
		doi:10.1016/S0378-4371(00)00463-5 transform to the outlines and
		visualize the mean shape. The output of the package are
		independent Fourier or wavelet coefficients which can be
		directly imported into a wide range of statistical packages in
		R. The package might prove useful in studies of any two
		dimensional objects.
