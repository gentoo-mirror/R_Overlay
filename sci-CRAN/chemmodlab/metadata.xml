		A Cheminformatics Modeling Laboratory for Fitting and Assessing
		Machine Learning Models // Contains a set of methods for
		fitting models and methods for validating the resulting models.
		The statistical methodologies comprise a comprehensive
		collection of approaches whose validity and utility have been
		accepted by experts in the Cheminformatics field. As promising
		new methodologies emerge from the statistical and data-mining
		communities, they will be incorporated into the laboratory.
		These methods are aimed at discovering quantitative structure-
		activity relationships (QSARs). However, the user can directly
		input their own choices of descriptors and responses, so the
		capability for comparing models is effectively unlimited.
