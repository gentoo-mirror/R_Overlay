		Machine Learning in R // Interface to a large number of
		classification and regression techniques, including machine-
		readable parameter descriptions. There is also an experimental
		extension for survival analysis, clustering and general,
		example-specific cost-sensitive learning. Generic resampling,
		including cross-validation, bootstrapping and subsampling.
		Hyperparameter tuning with modern optimization techniques, for
		single- and multi-objective problems.  Filter and wrapper
		methods for feature selection. Extension of basic learners with
		additional operations common in machine learning, also allowing
		for easy nested resampling. Most operations can be
		parallelized.
