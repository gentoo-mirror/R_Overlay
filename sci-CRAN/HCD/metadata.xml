		Hierarchical Community Detection by Recursive Partitioning //
		Hierarchical community detection on networks by a recursive
		spectral partitioning strategy, which is shown to be effective
		and efficient in Li, Lei, Bhattacharyya, Sarkar, Bickel, and
		Levina (2018) arXiv:1810.01509. The package also includes a
		data generating function for a binary tree stochastic block
		model, a special case of stochastic block model that admits
		hierarchy between communities.
