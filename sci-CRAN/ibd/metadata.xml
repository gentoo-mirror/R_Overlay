		Incomplete Block Designs // A collection of several utility
		functions related to binary incomplete block designs. The
		package contains function to generate A- and D-efficient binary
		incomplete block designs with given numbers of treatments,
		number of blocks and block size. The package also contains
		function to generate an incomplete block design with specified
		concurrence matrix. There are functions to generate balanced
		treatment incomplete block designs and incomplete block designs
		for test versus control treatments comparisons with specified
		concurrence matrix. Package also allows performing analysis of
		variance of data and computing estimated marginal means of
		factors from experiments using a connected incomplete block
		design. Tests of hypothesis of treatment contrasts in
		incomplete block design set up is supported.
