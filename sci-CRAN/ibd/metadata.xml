		INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGNS // This package contains several utility
		functions related to incomplete block designs. The package
		contains function to generate efficient incomplete block
		designs with given numbers of treatments, blocks and block
		size. The package also contains function to generate an
		incomplete block design with specified concurrence matrix.
		There are functions to generate balanced treatment incomplete
		block designs and incomplete block designs for test versus
		control treatments comparisons with specified concurrence
		matrix. Package also allows performing analysis of variance of
		data and computing least square means of factors from
		experiments using a connected incomplete block design. Tests of
		hypothesis of treatment contrasts in incomplete block design
		set up is supported.
