		Pseudo-Value Regression Approach for Network Analysis (PRANA) //
		A novel pseudo-value regression approach for the differential
		co-expression network analysis in expression data, which can
		incorporate additional clinical variables in the model. This is
		a direct regression modeling for the differential network
		analysis, and it is therefore computationally amenable for the
		most users.
