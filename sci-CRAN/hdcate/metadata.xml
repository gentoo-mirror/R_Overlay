		Estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effects with High-
		Dimensional Data // A two-step double-robust method to estimate
		the conditional average treatment effects (CATE) with
		potentially high-dimensional covariate(s). In the first stage,
		the nuisance functions necessary for identifying CATE are
		estimated by machine learning methods, allowing the number of
		covariates to be comparable to or larger than the sample size.
		The second stage consists of a low-dimensional local linear
		regression, reducing CATE to a function of the covariate(s) of
		interest. The CATE estimator implemented in this package not
		only allows for high-dimensional data, but also has the double
		robustness property: either the model for the propensity score
		or the models for the conditional means of the potential
		outcomes are allowed to be misspecified (but not both). This
		package is based on the paper by Fan et al., "Estimation of
		Conditional Average Treatment Effects With High-Dimensional
		Data" (2022), Journal of Business  Economic Statistics
		doi:10.1080/07350015.2020.1811102.
