		The Interpretation of Adjusted Cp Statistic // Several methods
		may be found for selecting a subset of regressors from a set of
		k candidate variables in multiple linear regression. One
		possibility is to evaluate all possible regression models and
		comparing them using Mallows's Cp statistic (Cp) according to
		Gilmour original study. Full model is calculated, all possible
		combinations of regressors are generated, adjusted Cp for each
		submodel are computed, and the submodel with the minimum
		adjusted value Cp (ModelMin) is calculated. To identify the
		final model, the package applies a sequence of hypothesis tests
		on submodels nested within ModelMin, following the approach
		outlined in Gilmour's original paper. For more details see the
		help of the function final_model() and the original study
		(1996) doi:10.2307/2348411.
