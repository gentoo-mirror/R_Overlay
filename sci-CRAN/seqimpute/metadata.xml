		Imputation of Missing Data in Sequence Analysis // Multiple
		imputation of missing data in a dataset using MICT or MICT-
		timing methods. The core idea of the algorithms is to fill gaps
		of missing data, which is the typical form of missing data in a
		longitudinal setting, recursively from their edges. Prediction
		is based on either a multinomial or random forest regression
		model. Covariates and time-dependent covariates can be included
		in the model.
