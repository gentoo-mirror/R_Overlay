		Imputation of Missing Data in Sequence Analysis // Multiple
		imputation of missing data present in a dataset through the
		prediction based on either a random forest or a multinomial
		regression model. Covariates and time-dependant covariates can
		be included in the model. The prediction of the missing values
		is based on the method of Halpin (2012) https://researchreposit
