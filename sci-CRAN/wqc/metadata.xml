		Wavelet Quantile Correlation Analysis // Estimate and plot
		wavelet quantile correlations(Kumar and Padakandla,2022)
		between two time series. Wavelet quantile correlation is used
		to capture the dependency between two time series across
		quantiles and different frequencies. This method is useful in
		identifying potential hedges and safe-haven instruments for
		investment purposes. See Kumar and Padakandla(2022)
		doi:10.1016/j.frl.2022.102707 for further details.
