		Auxiliary Data Package for Our Main Package 'dartR' // Data
		package for 'dartR'. Provides data sets to run examples in
		'dartR'. This was necessary due to the size limit imposed by
		'CRAN'. The data in 'dartR.data' is needed to run the examples
		provided in the 'dartR' functions. All available data sets are
		either based on actual data (but reduced in size) and/or
		simulated data sets to allow the fast execution of examples and
		demonstration of the functions.
