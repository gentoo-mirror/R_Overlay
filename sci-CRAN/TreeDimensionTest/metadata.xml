		Trajectory Presence and Heterogeneity in Multivariate Data //
		Testing for trajectory presence and heterogeneity on
		multivariate data. Two statistical methods (Tenha  Song 2022)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009829 are implemented. The tree
		dimension test quantifies the statistical evidence for
		trajectory presence. The subset specificity measure summarizes
		pattern heterogeneity using the minimum subtree cover. There is
		no user tunable parameters for either method. Examples are
		included to illustrate how to use the methods on single-cell
		data for studying gene and pathway expression dynamics and
		pathway expression specificity.
