		Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations with Multilevel Data //
		Addons for the 'mice' package to perform multiple imputation
		using chained equations with two-level data. Includes
		imputation methods dedicated to sporadically and systematically
		missing values. Imputation of continuous, binary or count
		variables are available. Following the recommendations of
		Audigier, V. et al (2018) doi:10.1214/18-STS646, the choice of
		the imputation method for each variable can be facilitated by a
		default choice tuned according to the structure of the
		incomplete dataset. Allows parallel calculation and
		overimputation for 'mice'.
