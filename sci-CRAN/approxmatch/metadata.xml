		Approximately Optimal Fine Balance Matching with Multiple Groups
		// Tools for constructing a matched design with multiple
		comparison groups. Further specifications of refined covariate
		balance restriction and exact match on covariate can be
		imposed. Matches are approximately optimal in  the sense that
		the cost of the solution is at most twice the optimal cost,
