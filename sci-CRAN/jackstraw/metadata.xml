		Statistical Inference for Unsupervised Learning // Test for
		association between the observed data and their systematic
		patterns of variations, that are often extracted by
		unsupervised learning. Systematic patterns may be captured by
		latent variables using principal component analysis (PCA),
		factor analysis (FA), and related methods. This allows one to,
		for example, obtain principal components (PCs) and conduct
		rigorous statistical testing for association between observed
		variables and PCs. Similarly, unsupervised clustering, such as
		K-means clustering, partition around medoids (PAM), and other
		algorithms, finds subpopulations among the observed variables.
		The jackstraw test can estimate statistical significance of
		cluster membership, so that one can evaluate the strength of
		membership assignments. This package also includes several
		related methods to support statistical inference and
		probabilistic feature selection for unsupervised learning.
