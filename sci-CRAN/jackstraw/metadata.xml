		Statistical Inference for Unsupervised Learning // Test for
		association between the observed data and their estimated
		latent variables. The jackstraw package provides a resampling
		strategy and testing scheme to estimate statistical
		significance of association between the observed data and their
		latent variables. Depending on the data type and the analysis
		aim, the latent variables may be estimated by principal
		component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), K-means
		clustering, and related algorithms. The jackstraw methods learn
		over-fitting characteristics inherent in this circular
		analysis, where the observed data are used to estimate the
		latent variables and used again to test against that estimated
		latent variables. When latent variables are estimated by PCA,
		the jackstraw enables statistical testing for association
		between observed variables and latent variables, as estimated
		by low-dimensional principal components (PCs). This essentially
		leads to identifying variables that are significantly
		associated with PCs. Similarly, unsupervised clustering, such
		as K-means clustering, partition around medoids (PAM), and
		others, finds coherent groups in high-dimensional data. The
		jackstraw estimates statistical significance of cluster
		membership, by testing association between data and cluster
		centers. Clustering membership can be improved by using the
		resulting jackstraw p-values and posterior inclusion
		probabilities (PIPs), with an application to unsupervised
		evaluation of cell identities in single cell RNA-seq.
