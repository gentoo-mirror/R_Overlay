		The Compact Encoding Detector // R bindings of the Google Compact
		Encoding Detection library
		(https://github.com/google/compact_enc_det). The library takes
		as input a source buffer of raw text bytes and
		probabilistically determines the most likely encoding for that
		text. It was designed with accuracy, robustness, small size,
		and speed in mind.
