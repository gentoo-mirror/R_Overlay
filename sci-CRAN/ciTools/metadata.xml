		Confidence or Prediction Intervals, Quantiles, and Probabilities
		for Statistical Models // Functions to append confidence
		intervals, prediction intervals, and other quantities of
		interest to data frames. All appended quantities are for the
		response variable, after conditioning on the model and
		covariates. This package has a data frame first syntax that
		allows for easy piping. Currently supported models include
		(log-) linear, (log-) linear mixed, generalized linear models,
		generalized linear mixed models, and accelerated failure time
		models.
