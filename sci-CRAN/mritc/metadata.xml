		MRI Tissue Classification // Implements various methods for
		tissue classification in magnetic resonance (MR) images of the
		brain, including normal mixture models and hidden Markov normal
		mixture models, as outlined in Feng  Tierney (2011)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v044.i07. These methods allow a structural MR
		image to be classified into gray matter, white matter and
		cerebrospinal fluid tissue types.
