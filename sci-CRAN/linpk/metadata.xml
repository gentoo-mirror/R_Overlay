		Generate Concentration-Time Profiles from Linear PK Systems //
		Generate concentration-time profiles from linear
		pharmacokinetic (PK) systems, possibly with first-order
		absorption or zero-order infusion, possibly with one or more
		peripheral compartments, and possibly under steady-state
		conditions. Single or multiple doses may be specified.
		Secondary (derived) PK parameters (e.g. Cmax, Ctrough, AUC,
		Tmax, half-life, etc.) are computed.
