		Simulating Neutral Landscape Models // Provides neutral landscape
		models (Gardner et al. 1987 doi:10.1007/BF02275262, With 1997
		doi:10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96210.x) that can easily extend in
		existing landscape analyses. Neutral landscape models range
		from "hard" neutral models (only random functions) to "soft"
		ones (with parameters) and generate landscape patterns that are
		not grounded in ecological reasoning. Thus, these patterns can
		be used as null models in landscape ecology. 'NLMR' combines a
		large number of algorithms from published software (Saura
		Martnez 2000   doi:10.1023/A:1008107902848, Etherington et al.
		2015 doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12308) for simulating neutral
		landscapes and includes utility functions to classify and
		combine the landscapes. The simulation results are obtained in
		a geospatial data format (raster* objects from the 'raster'
		package) and can, therefore, be used in any sort of raster data
		operation that is performed with standard observation data.
