		Simulating Neutral Landscape Models // Provides neutral landscape
		models (doi:10.1007/BF02275262, http://sci-
		hub.tw/10.1007/bf02275262). Neutral landscape models range from
		"hard" neutral models (completely random distributed), to
		"soft" neutral models (definable spatial characteristics) and
		generate landscape patterns that are independent of ecological
		processes. Thus, these patterns can be used as null models in
		landscape ecology. 'NLMR' combines a large number of algorithms
		from other published software for simulating neutral
		landscapes. The simulation results are obtained in a spatial
		data format (raster* objects from the 'raster' package) and
		can, therefore, be used in any sort of raster data operation
		that is performed with standard observation data.
