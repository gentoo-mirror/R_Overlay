		Pipeline for Explainable Machine Learning with Functional Data //
		Implements the Variable importance Explainable Elastic Shape
		Analysis pipeline for explainable machine learning with
		functional data inputs. Converts training and testing data
		functional inputs to elastic shape analysis principal
		components that account for vertical and/or horizontal
		variability. Computes feature importance to identify important
		principal components and visualizes variability captured by
		functional principal components. See Goode et al. (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2501.07602 for technical details about the
		methodology.
