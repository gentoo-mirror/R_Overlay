		A computational biologist's toolkit to get data from avidaDB //
		It provides users of the R programming language with easy-to-
		use tools for performing complex queries on avidaDB, a semantic
		database that stores genomic and transcriptomic data of self-
		replicating computer programs (known as digital organisms) that
		mutate and evolve within a user-defined computational
		environment. The functions send SPARQL queries to the avidaDB
		endpoint https://graphdb.fortunalab.org/repositories/avidaDB.
