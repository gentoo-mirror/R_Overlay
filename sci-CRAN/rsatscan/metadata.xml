		Tools, Classes, and Methods for Interfacing with 'SaTScan' Stand-
		Alone Software // 'SaTScan'(TM) https://www.satscan.org is
		software for finding regions in Time, Space, or Time-Space that
		have excess risk, based on scan statistics, and uses Monte
		Carlo hypothesis testing to generate P-values for these
		regions.  The 'rsatscan' package provides functions for writing
		R data frames in 'SaTScan'-readable formats, for setting
		'SaTScan' parameters, for running 'SaTScan' in the OS, and for
		reading the files that 'SaTScan' creates.
