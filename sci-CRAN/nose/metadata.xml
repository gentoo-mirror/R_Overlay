		nose Package for R // The nose package consists of a collection
		of three functions for classifying sparseness in typical 2 x 2
		data sets with at least one cell should have zero count. These
		functions are based on the three widely applied summary
		measures for 2 x 2 categorical data viz, Risk Difference (RD),
		Relative Risk (RR), Odds Ratio (OR). This package helps to
		identify suitable continuity correction for zero cells when a
		multi centre analysis or a meta analysis is carried out.
		Further, it can be considered as a tool for sensitivity
		analysis for adding a continuity correction and to identify the
		presence of Simpson's paradox.
