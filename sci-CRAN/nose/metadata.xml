		Classification of Sparseness in 2-by-2 Categorical Data //
		Provides functions for classifying sparseness in 2 x 2
		categorical data where one or more cells have zero counts. The
		classification uses three widely applied summary measures: Risk
		Difference (RD), Relative Risk (RR), and Odds Ratio (OR). Helps
		in selecting suitable continuity corrections for zero cells in
		multi-centre or meta-analysis studies. Also supports
		sensitivity analysis and can detect phenomena such as Simpson's
		paradox. The methodology is based on Subbiah and Srinivasan
		(2008) doi:10.1016/j.spl.2008.06.023.
