		Test (Multiple) Arguments of a User-Defined Prediction Algorithm
		// Finding the best values for user-specified arguments of a
		prediction algorithm can be difficult, particularly if there is
		an interaction between argument levels. This package automates
		the testing of any user-defined prediction algorithm over an
		arbitrary number of arguments. It includes functions for
		testing the algorithm over the given arguments with respect to
		an arbitrary number of user-defined diagnostics, visualising
		the results of these tests, and finding the optimal argument
		combinations with respect to each diagnostic.
