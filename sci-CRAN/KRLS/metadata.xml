		Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares // Package implements
		Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a machine
		learning method to fit multidimensional functions y=f(x) for
		regression and classification problems without relying on
		linearity or additivity assumptions. KRLS finds the best
		fitting function by minimizing the squared loss of a Tikhonov
		regularization problem, using Gaussian kernels as radial basis
		functions. For further details see Hainmueller and Hazlett
		(2014).
