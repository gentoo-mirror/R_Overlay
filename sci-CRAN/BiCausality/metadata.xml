		Binary Causality Inference Framework // A framework to infer
		causality on binary data using techniques in frequent pattern
		mining and estimation statistics. Given a set of individual
		vectors S={x} where x(i) is a realization value of binary
		variable i, the framework infers empirical causal relations of
		binary variables i,j from S in a form of causal graph G=(V,E)
		where V is a set of nodes representing binary variables and
		there is an edge from i to j in E if the variable i causes j.
		The framework determines dependency among variables as well as
		analyzing confounding factors before deciding whether i causes
		j.  The publication of this package is at Chainarong
		Amornbunchornvej, Navaporn Surasvadi, Anon Plangprasopchok, and
		Suttipong Thajchayapong (2023)
