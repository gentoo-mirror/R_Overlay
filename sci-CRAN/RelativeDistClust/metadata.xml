		Clustering with a Novel Non Euclidean Relative Distance // Using
		the novel Relative Distance to cluster datasets. Implementation
		of a clustering approach based on the k-means algorithm that
		can be used with any distance. In addition, implementation of
		the Hartigan and Wong method to accommodate alternative
		distance metrics. Both methods can operate with any distance
		measure, provided a suitable method is available to compute
		cluster centers under the chosen metric. Additionally, the
		k-medoids algorithm is implemented, offering a robust
		alternative for clustering without the need of computing
		cluster centers under the chosen metric. All three methods are
		designed to support Relative distances, Euclidean distances,
		and any user-defined distance functions. The Hartigan and Wong
		method is described in Hartigan and Wong (1979)
		doi:10.2307/2346830 and an explanation of the k-medoids
		algorithm can be found in Reynolds et al (2006)
		doi:10.1007/s10852-005-9022-1.
