		Predict Gender from Names Using Historical Data // Infers state-
		recorded gender categories from first names and dates of birth
		using historical datasets. By using these datasets instead of
		lists of male and female names, this package is able to more
		accurately infer the gender of a name, and it is able to report
		the probability that a name was male or female. GUIDELINES:
		This method must be used cautiously and responsibly. Please be
		sure to see the guidelines and warnings about usage in the
		'README' or the package documentation. See Blevins and Mullen
		(2015) http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/3/000223/0002
		23.html.
