		Pretty Timeline Creation // Create interactive timelines or Gantt
		charts that are usable in the 'RStudio' viewer pane, in 'R
		Markdown' documents and in 'Shiny' apps. Hover the mouse
		pointer over a point or task to show details or drag a
		rectangle to zoom in. Timelines and their components can
		afterwards be manipulated using plotly_build(), which
		transforms the plot into a mutable list.
