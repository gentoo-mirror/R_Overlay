		Pretty Timeline Creation // Create timelines or Gantt charts,
		offline and interactive, that are usable in the 'RStudio'
		viewer pane, in 'R Markdown' documents and in 'Shiny' apps
		using 'plotly.js', a high-level, declarative charting library
		(see https://plot.ly/javascript). Hover the mouse pointer over
		a point or task to show details or drag a rectangle to zoom in.
		Timelines (and the data behind them) can be manipulated using
		'plotly_build()' or, once uploaded to a 'plotly' account,
		viewed and modified in a web browser.
