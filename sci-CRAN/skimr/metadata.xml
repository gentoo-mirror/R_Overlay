		Compact and Flexible Summaries of Data // A simple to use summary
		function that can be used with pipes and displays nicely in the
		console. The default summary statistics may be modified by the
		user as can the default formatting. Support for data frames and
		vectors is included, and users can implement their own skim
		methods for specific object types as described in a vignette.
		Default summaries include support for inline spark graphs.
		Instructions for managing these on specific operating systems
		are given in the "Using skimr" vignette and the README.
