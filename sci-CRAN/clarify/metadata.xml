		Simulation-Based Inference for Regression Models // Performs
		simulation-based inference as an alternative to the delta
		method for obtaining valid confidence intervals and p-values
		for regression post-estimation quantities, such as average
		marginal effects and predictions at representative values. This
		framework for simulation-based inference is especially useful
		when the resulting quantity is not normally distributed and the
		delta method approximation fails. The methodology is described
		in King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000) doi:10.2307/2669316.
		'clarify' is meant to replace some of the functionality of the
		archived package 'Zelig'; see the vignette "Translating Zelig
		to clarify" for replicating this functionality.
