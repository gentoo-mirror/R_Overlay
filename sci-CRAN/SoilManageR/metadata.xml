		Calculate Soil Management Indicators for Agricultural Practice
		Assessment // Calculate numerical agricultural soil management
		indicators from on a management timeline of an arable field.
		Currently, indicators for carbon (C) input into the soil
		system, soil tillage intensity rating (STIR), number of soil
		cover and living plant cover days, N fertilization and
		livestock intensity, and plant diversity are implemented. The
		functions can also be used independently of the management
		timeline to calculate some indicators. The package contains
		tables with reference information for the functions, as well as
		a '*.xlsx' template to collect the management data.
