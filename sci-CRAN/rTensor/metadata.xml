		Tools for Tensor Analysis and Decomposition // A set of tools for
		creation, manipulation, and modeling of tensors with arbitrary
		number of modes. A tensor in the context of data analysis is a
		multidimensional array. rTensor does this by providing a S4
		class 'Tensor' that wraps around the base 'array' class.
		rTensor provides common tensor operations as methods, including
		matrix unfolding, summing/averaging across modes, calculating
		the Frobenius norm, and taking the inner product between two
		tensors. Familiar array operations are overloaded, such as
		index subsetting via '[' and element-wise operations. rTensor
		also implements various tensor decomposition, including CP,
		GLRAM, MPCA, PVD, and Tucker. For tensors with 3 modes, rTensor
		also implements transpose, t-product, and t-SVD, as defined in
		Kilmer et al. (2013). Some auxiliary functions include the
		Khatri-Rao product, Kronecker product, and the Hadamard product
		for a list of matrices.
