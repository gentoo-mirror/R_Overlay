		Linguistic Phonetic Fieldwork Tools // There are a lot of
		different typical tasks that should be solved during phonetic
		research and experiments, such as creation of presentation that
		will contain all stimuli, rename and concatenate multiple sound
		files recorded during phonetic session, automatically annotate
		'Praat' TextGrids (this is one of the sound annotation
		standards provided by 'Praat' software, see Paul Boersma, David
		Weenink 2018 http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), create an html
		that includes annotation and spectrogram tables, convert
		multiple formats ('Praat' TextGrid, 'EXMARaLDA' and 'ELAN')
		into each other. All those tasks could be solved by mixture of
		different tools (some programs in any programming language for
		automatic renaming, some Praat scripts for the file
		concatenation and renaming, etc). This package provides
		functionality that will make it easier to solve those tasks
		independently of any of tools. You could also compare the
		functionality with other packages: 'rPraat'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPraat, 'textgRid'
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textgRid.
