		Linguistic Phonetic Fieldwork Tools // There are a lot of
		different typical tasks that have to be solved during phonetic
		research and experiments. This includes creating a presentation
		that will contain all stimuli, renaming and concatenating
		multiple sound files recorded during a session, automatic
		annotation in 'Praat' TextGrids (this is one of the sound
		annotation standards provided by 'Praat' software, see Boersma
		Weenink 2018 http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), creating an
		html table with annotations and spectrograms, and converting
		multiple formats ('Praat' TextGrid, 'ELAN', 'EXMARaLDA',
		'Audacity', subtitles '.srt', and 'FLEx' flextext). All of
		these tasks can be solved by a mixture of different tools (any
		programming language has programs for automatic renaming, and
		Praat contains scripts for concatenating and renaming files,
		etc.). 'phonfieldwork' provides a functionality that will make
		it easier to solve those tasks independently of any additional
		tools. You can also compare the functionality with other
		packages: 'rPraat' https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPraat,
		'textgRid' https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textgRid.
