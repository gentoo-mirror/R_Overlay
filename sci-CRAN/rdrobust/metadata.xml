		Robust Data-Driven Statistical Inference in Regression-
		Discontinuity Designs // Regression-discontinuity (RD) designs
		are quasi-experimental research designs popular in social,
		behavioral and natural sciences. The RD design is usually
		employed to study the (local) causal effect of a treatment,
		intervention or policy. This package provides tools for data-
		driven graphical and analytical statistical inference in RD
		designs: rdrobust() to construct local-polynomial point
		estimators and robust confidence intervals for average
		treatment effects at the cutoff in Sharp, Fuzzy and Kink RD
		settings, rdbwselect() to perform bandwidth selection for the
		different procedures implemented, and rdplot() to conduct
		exploratory data analysis (RD plots).
