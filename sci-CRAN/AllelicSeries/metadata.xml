		Allelic Series Test // Implementation of gene-level rare variant
		association tests targeting allelic series: genes where
		increasingly deleterious mutations have increasingly large
		phenotypic effects. The COding-variant Allelic Series Test
		(COAST) operates on the benign missense variants (BMVs),
		deleterious missense variants (DMVs), and protein truncating
		variants (PTVs) within a gene. COAST uses a set of adjustable
		weights that tailor the test towards rejecting the null
		hypothesis for genes where the average magnitude of effect
		increases monotonically from BMVs to DMVs to PTVs. See McCaw
		ZR, ODushlaine C, Somineni H, Bereket M, Klein C, Karaletsos T,
		Casale FP, Koller D, Soare TW. (2023) "An allelic series rare
		variant association test for candidate gene discovery"
