		Multiple Change-Point Detection for High-Dimensional GARCH
		Processes // Implements a segmentation algorithm for multiple
		change-point detection in high-dimensional GARCH processes. It
		simultaneously segments GARCH processes by identifying 'common'
		change-points, each of which can be shared by a subset or all
		of the component time series as a change-point in their within-
		series and/or cross-sectional correlation structure.
