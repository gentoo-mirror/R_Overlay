		Joint Approximate Diagonalization of a Set of Square Matrices //
		Different algorithms to perform approximate joint
		diagonalization of a finite set of square matrices. Depending
		on the algorithm, orthogonal or non-orthogonal diagonalizer is
		found. These algorithms are particularly useful in the context
		of blind source separation.
