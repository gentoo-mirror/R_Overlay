		Penalized Orthogonal-Components Regression // Penalized
		orthogonal-components regression (POCRE) is a supervised
		dimension reduction method for high-dimensional data. It
		sequentially constructs orthogonal components (with selected
		features) which are maximally correlated to the response
		residuals. POCRE can also construct common components for
		multiple responses and thus build up latent-variable models.
