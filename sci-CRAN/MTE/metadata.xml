		Maximum Tangent Likelihood and Other Robust Estimation for High-
		Dimensional Regression // Provides several robust estimators
		for linear regression and variable selection. They are Maximum
		tangent likelihood estimator (Qin, et al. (2017)
		arXiv:1708.05439), least absolute deviance estimator, and Huber
		loss. The penalized version of each of these estimator
		incorporates L1 penalty function, i.e., LASSO and Adaptive
		Lasso. They are able to produce consistent estimates for both
		fixed and high-dimensional settings.
