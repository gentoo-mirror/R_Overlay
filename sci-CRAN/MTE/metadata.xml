		Maximum Tangent Likelihood Estimation for Robust Linear
		Regression and Variable Selection // Several robust estimators
		for linear regression and variable selection are provided.
		Included are Maximum tangent likelihood estimator by Qin, et
		al., (2017), arXiv preprint doi:10.48550/arXiv.1708.05439,
		least absolute deviance estimator and Huber regression. The
		penalized version of each of these estimator incorporates L1
		penalty function, i.e., LASSO and Adaptive Lasso. They are able
		to produce consistent estimates for both fixed and high-
		dimensional settings.
