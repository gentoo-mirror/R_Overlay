		Maximum Tangent Likelihood Estimation for Linear Regression //
		Several robust estimators for linear regression and variable
		selection are provided. Included are Maximum tangent likelihood
		estimator (Qin, et al., 2017), least absolute deviance
		estimator and Huber regression. The penalized version of each
		of these estimator incorporates L1 penalty function, i.e.,
		LASSO and Adaptive Lasso. They are able to produce consistent
		estimates for both fixed and high-dimensional settings.
