		Estimation and Hypothesis Testing for Threshold Regression //
		Threshold regression models are also called two-phase
		regression, broken-stick regression, split-point regression,
		structural change models, and regression kink models. Methods
		for both continuous and discontinuous threshold models are
		included, but the support for the former is much greater. This
		package is described in Fong, Huang, Gilbert and Permar (2017)
		chngpt: threshold regression model estimation and inference,
		BMC Bioinformatics, in press, DOI:10.1186/s12859-017-1863-x.
