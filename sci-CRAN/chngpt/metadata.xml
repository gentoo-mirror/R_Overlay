		Estimation and Hypothesis Testing for Threshold Regression //
		Threshold regression models are also called two-phase
		regression, broken-stick regression, split-point regression,
		structural change models, and regression kink models, with and
		without interaction terms. Methods for both continuous and
		discontinuous threshold models are included, but the support
		for the former is much greater. This package is described in
		Fong, Huang, Gilbert and Permar (2017)
		DOI:10.1186/s12859-017-1863-x.
