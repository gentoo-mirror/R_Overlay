		Change Point Regression // Change point regression models are
		also called two-phase regression, break-point regression,
		split-point regression, structural change models and threshold
		regression models. Hypothesis testing in change point logistic
		regression with or without interaction terms (Fong, Y., Di, C.,
		Perma, S. (2014) doi:10.1002/sim.6419). Several options are
		provided for testing in models with interaction, including a
		maximum of likelihood ratios test that determines p-value
		through Monte Carlo. Estimation under change point model is
		also included with model-robust confidence intervals for
		continuous threshold regression models (Fong, Y., Di, C.,
		Huang, Y., Gilbert, P. (2017) doi:10.1111/biom.12623).
