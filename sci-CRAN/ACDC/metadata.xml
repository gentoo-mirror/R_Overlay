		Analysis of Congruent Diversification Classes // Features tools
		for exploring congruent phylogenetic birth-death models. It can
		construct the pulled speciation- and net-diversification rates
		from a reference model. Given alternative speciation- or
		extinction rates, it can construct new models that are
		congruent with the reference model. Functionality is included
		to sample new rate functions, and to visualize the distribution
		of one congruence class. See also Louca  Pennell (2020)
