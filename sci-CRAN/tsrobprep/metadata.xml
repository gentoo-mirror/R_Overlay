		Robust Preprocessing of Time Series Data // Methods for handling
		the missing values outliers are introduced in this package. The
		recognized missing values and outliers are replaced using a
		model-based approach. The model may consist of both
		autoregressive components and external regressors. The methods
		work robust and efficient, and they are fully tunable. The
		primary motivation for writing the package was preprocessing of
		the energy systems data, e.g. power plant production time
		series, but the package could be used with any time series
		data. For details, see Narajewski et al. (2021)
