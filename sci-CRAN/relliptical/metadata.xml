		The Truncated Elliptical Family of Distributions // It offers
		random numbers generation from members of the truncated
		multivariate elliptical family of distribution such as the
		truncated versions of the Normal, Student-t, Pearson VII,
		Slash, Logistic, among others. Particular distributions can be
		provided by specifying the density generating function. It also
		computes the first two moments (covariance matrix as well) for
		some particular distributions.
