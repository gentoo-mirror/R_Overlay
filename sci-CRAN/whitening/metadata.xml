		Whitening and High-Dimensional Canonical Correlation Analysis //
		Implements the whitening methods (ZCA, PCA, Cholesky, ZCA-cor,
		and PCA-cor) discussed in Kessy, Lewin, and Strimmer (2018)
		"Optimal whitening and decorrelation",
		doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1277159, as well as the whitening
		approach to canonical correlation analysis allowing negative
		canonical correlations described in Jendoubi and Strimmer
		(2019) "A whitening approach to probabilistic canonical
		correlation analysis for omics data integration",
		doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2572-9. The package also offers
		functions to simulate random orthogonal matrices, compute
		(correlation) loadings and explained variation. It also
		contains four example data sets (extended UCI wine data, TCGA
		LUSC data, nutrimouse data, extended pitprops data).
