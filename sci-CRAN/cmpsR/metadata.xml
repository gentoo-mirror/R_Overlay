		R Implementation of Congruent Matching Profile Segments Method //
		This is an open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching
		Profile Segments (CMPS) method (Chen et al.
		2019)doi:10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.109964. In general, it can be
		used for objective comparison of striated tool marks, and in
		our examples, we specifically use it for bullet signatures
		comparisons. The CMPS score is expected to be large if two
		signatures are similar. So it can also be considered as a
		feature that measures the similarity of two bullet signatures.
