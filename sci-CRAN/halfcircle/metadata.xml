		Plot Halfcircle Diagram // There are growing concerns on flow
		data in diverse fields including trade, migration, knowledge
		diffusion, disease spread, and transportation. The package is
		an effective visual support to learn the pattern of flow which
		is called halfcircle diagram. The flow between two nodes placed
		on the center line of a circle is represented using a half
		circle drawn from the origin to the destination in a clockwise
		direction. Through changing the order of nodes, the halfcircle
		diagram enables users to examine the complex relationship
		between bidirectional flow and each potential determinants.
		Furthermore, the halfmeancenter function, which calculates (un)
		weighted mean center of half circles, makes the comparison
		easier.
