		Analysis via Simulation of Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Data //
		Uses simulation to create prediction intervals for post-policy
		outcomes in interrupted time series (ITS) designs, following
		Miratrix (2020) arXiv:2002.05746. This package provides methods
		for fitting ITS models with lagged outcomes and variables to
		account for temporal dependencies.  It then conducts inference
		via simulation, simulating a set of plausible counterfactual
		post-policy series to compare to the observed post-policy
		series. This package also provides methods to visualize such
		data, and also to incorporate seasonality models and smoothing
		and aggregation/summarization.  This work partially funded by
		Arnold Ventures in collaboration with MDRC.
