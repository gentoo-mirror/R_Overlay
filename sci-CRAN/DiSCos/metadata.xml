		Distributional Synthetic Controls Estimation // The method of
		synthetic controls is a widely-adopted tool for evaluating
		causal effects of policy changes in settings with observational
		data. In many settings where it is applicable, researchers want
		to identify causal effects of policy changes on a treated unit
		at an aggregate level while having access to data at a finer
		granularity. This package implements a simple extension of the
		synthetic controls estimator, developed in Gunsilius (2023)
		doi:10.3982/ECTA18260, that takes advantage of this additional
		structure and provides nonparametric estimates of the
		heterogeneity within the aggregate unit. The idea is to
		replicate the quantile function associated with the treated
		unit by a weighted average of quantile functions of the control
		units. The package contains tools for aggregating and plotting
		the resulting distributional estimates, as well as for carrying
		out inference on them.
