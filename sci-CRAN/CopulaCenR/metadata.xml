		Copula-Based Regression Models for Multivariate Censored Data //
		Copula-based regression models for multivariate censored data,
		including bivariate right-censored data, bivariate interval-
		censored data, and right/interval-censored semi-competing risks
		data. Currently supports Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe, AMH and
		Copula2 copula models. For marginal models, it supports
		parametric (Weibull, Loglogistic, Gompertz) and semiparametric
		(Cox and transformation) models. Includes methods for
		convenient prediction and plotting. Also provides a bivariate
		time-to-event simulation function and an information ratio-
		based goodness-of-fit test for copula. Method details can be
		found in Sun et.al (2019) Lifetime Data Analysis, Sun et.al
		(2021) Biostatistics, Sun et.al (2022) Statistical Methods in
		Medical Research, Sun et.al (2022) Biometrics, and Sun et al.
		(2023+) JRSSC.
