		Copula-Based Regression Models for Bivariate Censored Data //
		Copula-based regression models for bivariate censored data,
		including bivariate right-censored data and bivariate interval-
		censored data. Currently supports Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe,
		AMH and Copula2 copula models. For marginal models, it supports
		parametric (Weibull, Loglogistic, Gompertz), weakly-parametric
		piecewise-constant hazards (only for bivariate right-censored)
		and semiparametric transformation (only for bivariate interval-
		censored data) models. Includes methods for convenient
		prediction and plotting. Also provides a bivariate time-to-
		event simulation function. Method details can be found in Sun
		et.al. (2018)  doi:10.1007/s10985-018-09459-5 and Sun et.al
		(2019) arXiv:1901.01918.
