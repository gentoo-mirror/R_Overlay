		Computation of 2D and 3D Elliptical Joint Confidence Regions //
		Computing elliptical joint confidence regions at a specified
		confidence level. It provides the flexibility to estimate
		either classical or robust confidence regions, which can be
		visualized in 2D or 3D plots. The classical approach assumes
		normality and uses the mean and covariance matrix to define the
		confidence regions. Alternatively, the robustified version
		employs estimators like minimum covariance determinant (MCD)
		and M-estimator, making them less sensitive to outliers and
		departures from normality. Furthermore, the functions allow
		users to group the dataset based on categorical variables and
		estimate separate confidence regions for each group. This
		capability is particularly useful for exploring potential
		differences or similarities across subgroups within a dataset.
