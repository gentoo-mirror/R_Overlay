		Tools for Preprocessing Visual World Data // Gaze data from the
		Visual World Paradigm requires significant preprocessing prior
		to plotting and analyzing the data. This package provides
		functions for preparing visual world eye-tracking data for
		statistical analysis and plotting. It can prepare data for
		linear analyses (e.g., ANOVA, Gaussian-family LMER, Gaussian-
		family GAMM) as well as logistic analyses (e.g., binomial-
		family LMER and binomial-family GAMM). Additionally, it
		contains various plotting functions for creating grand average
		and conditional average plots. See the vignette for samples of
		the functionality. Currently, the functions in this package are
		designed for handling data collected with SR Research Eyelink
		eye trackers using Sample Reports created in SR Research Data
		Viewer; however, in subsequent releases we would like to add
		functionality for data collected with other systems.
