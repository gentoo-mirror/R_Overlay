		Response Surface Analysis // Advanced response surface analysis.
		The main function RSA computes and compares several nested
		polynomial regression models (full second- or third-order
		polynomial, shifted and rotated squared difference model,
		rising ridge surfaces, basic squared difference model,
		asymmetric or level-dependent congruence effect models). The
		package provides plotting functions for 3d wireframe surfaces,
		interactive 3d plots, and contour plots. Calculates many
		surface parameters (a1 to a5, principal axes, stationary point,
		eigenvalues) and provides standard, robust, or bootstrapped
		standard errors and confidence intervals for them.
