		Simulation and Estimation of Multi-State Discrete-Time Semi-
		Markov and Markov Models // Performs parametric and non-
		parametric estimation and simulation for multi-state discrete-
		time semi-Markov processes. For the parametric estimation,
		several discrete distributions are considered for the sojourn
		times: Uniform, Geometric, Poisson, Discrete Weibull and
		Negative Binomial. The non-parametric estimation concerns the
		sojourn time distributions, where no assumptions are done on
		the shape of distributions. Moreover, the estimation can be
		done on the basis of one or several sample paths, with or
		without censoring at the beginning or/and at the end of the
		sample paths. The implemented methods are described in Barbu,
		V.S., Limnios, N. (2008) doi:10.1007/978-0-387-73173-5, Barbu,
		V.S., Limnios, N. (2008) doi:10.1080/10485250701261913 and
		Trevezas, S., Limnios, N. (2011)
		doi:10.1080/10485252.2011.555543. Estimation and simulation of
		discrete-time k-th order Markov chains are also considered.
