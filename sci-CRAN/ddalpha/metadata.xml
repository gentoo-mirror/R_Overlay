		Depth-Based Classification and Calculation of Data Depth //
		Contains procedures for depth-based supervised learning, which
		are entirely non-parametric, in particular the DDalpha-
		procedure (Lange, Mosler and Mozharovskyi, 2014
		doi:10.1007/s00362-012-0488-4). The training data sample is
		transformed by a statistical depth function to a compact low-
		dimensional space, where the final classification is done. It
		also offers an extension to functional data and routines for
		calculating certain notions of statistical depth functions. 50
		multivariate and 5 functional classification problems are
		included.
