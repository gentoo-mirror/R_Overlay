		Robust Expectation-Maximization Estimation for Latent Variable
		Models // Traditional latent variable models assume that the
		population is homogeneous, meaning that all individuals in the
		population are assumed to have the same latent structure.
		However, this assumption is often violated in practice given
		that individuals may differ in their age, gender, socioeconomic
		status, and other factors that can affect their latent
		structure. The robust expectation maximization (REM) algorithm
		is a statistical method for estimating the parameters of a
		latent variable model in the presence of population
		heterogeneity as recommended by Nieser  Cochran (2023)
		doi:10.1037/met0000413. The REM algorithm is based on the
		expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, but it allows for the
		case when all the data are generated by the assumed data
		generating model.
