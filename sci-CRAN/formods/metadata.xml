		'Shiny' Modules for General Tasks // 'Shiny' apps can often make
		use of the same key elements, this package provides modules for
		common tasks (data upload, wrangling data, figure generation
		and saving the app state), and also a framework for developing.
		These modules can react and interact as well as generate code
		to create reproducible analyses.
