		Non-Longitudinal Bayesian Historical Borrowing Models //
		Historical borrowing in clinical trials can improve precision
		and operating characteristics. This package supports a
		hierarchical model and a mixture model to borrow historical
		control data from other studies to better characterize the
		control response of the current study. It also quantifies the
		amount of borrowing through benchmark models (independent and
		pooled). Some of the methods are discussed by Viele et al.
