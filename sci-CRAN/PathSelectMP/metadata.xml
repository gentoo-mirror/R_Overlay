		Backwards Variable Selection for Paths using M Plus // Primarily
		for use with datasets containing only categorical variables,
		although continuous variables may be included as independent
		variables in paths. Using M Plus, backward variable selection
		is performed on all Total, Total Indirect, and then Direct
		effects until none of these effects have p-values greater than
		the specified target p-value. If there are missing values in
		the data, imputations are performed using the Mice package.
		Then selection is performed with the imputed data sets, and
		results are averaged.
