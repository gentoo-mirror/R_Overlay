		Collinearity Detection in a Multiple Linear Regression Model //
		The detection of worrying approximate collinearity in a
		multiple linear regression model is a problem addressed in all
		existing statistical packages. However, we have detected
		deficits regarding to the incorrect treatment of qualitative
		independent variables and the role of the intercept of the
		model. The objective of this package is to correct these
		deficits. In this package will be available detection and
		treatment techniques traditionally used as the recently
		developed.
