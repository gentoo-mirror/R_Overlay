		Get Data Frame Representations of 'Elasticsearch' Results //
		'Elasticsearch' is an open-source, distributed, document-based
		datastore (https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). It
		provides an 'HTTP' 'API' for querying the database and
		extracting datasets, but that 'API' was not designed for common
		data science workflows like pulling large batches of records
		and normalizing those documents into a data frame that can be
		used as a training dataset for statistical models.
		'uptasticsearch' provides an interface for 'Elasticsearch' that
		is explicitly designed to make these data science workflows
		easy and fun.
