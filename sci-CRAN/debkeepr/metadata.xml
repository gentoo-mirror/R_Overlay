		Analysis of Non-Decimal Currencies and Double-Entry Bookkeeping
		// Analysis of historical non-decimal currencies and value
		systems that use tripartite or tetrapartite systems such as
		pounds, shillings, and pence. It introduces new vector classes
		to represent non-decimal currencies, making them compatible
		with numeric classes, and provides functions to work with these
		classes in data frames in the context of double-entry
		bookkeeping.
