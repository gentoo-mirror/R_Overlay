		Kalman Filter and Smoother for Exponential Family State Space
		Models // State space modelling is an efficient and flexible
		method for statistical inference of a broad class of time
		series and other data. KFAS (Helske 2017)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v078.i10 includes fast functions for Kalman
		filtering, smoothing, forecasting, and simulation of
		multivariate exponential family state space models, with
		observations from Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, negative
		binomial, and gamma distributions.
