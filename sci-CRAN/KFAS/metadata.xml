		Kalman Filter and Smoother for Exponential Family State Space
		Models // State space modelling is an efficient and flexible
		method for statistical inference of a broad class of time
		series and other data. KFAS includes fast functions for Kalman
		filtering, smoothing, forecasting, and simulation of
		multivariate exponential family state space models, with
		observations from Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, negative
		binomial, and gamma distributions.
