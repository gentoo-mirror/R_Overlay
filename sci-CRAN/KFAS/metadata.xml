		Kalman Filter and Smoother for Exponential Family State Space
		Models // State space modelling is an efficient and flexible
		framework for statistical inference of a broad class of time
		series and other data. KFAS includes computationally efficient
		functions for Kalman filtering, smoothing, forecasting, and
		simulation of multivariate exponential family state space
		models, with observations from Gaussian, Poisson, binomial,
		negative binomial, and gamma distributions. See the paper by
		Helske (2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v078.i10 for details.
