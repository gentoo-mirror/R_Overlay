		Parallel Model-Based Clustering using Expectation-Gathering-
		Maximization Algorithm for Finite Mixture Gaussian Model //
		Aims to utilize model-based clustering (unsupervised) for high
		dimensional and ultra large data, especially in a distributed
		manner. The code employs 'pbdMPI' to perform a expectation-
		gathering-maximization algorithm for finite mixture Gaussian
		models. The unstructured dispersion matrices are assumed in the
		Gaussian models. The implementation is default in the single
		program multiple data programming model. The code can be
		executed through 'pbdMPI' and MPI' implementations such as
		'OpenMPI' and 'MPICH'. See the High Performance Statistical
		Computing website https://snoweye.github.io/hpsc/ for more
		information, documents and examples.
