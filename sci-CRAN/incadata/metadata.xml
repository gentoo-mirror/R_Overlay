		Recognize and Handle Data in Formats Used by Swedish Cancer
		Centers // Handle data in formats used by cancer centers in
		Sweden, both from 'INCA' (the current register platform, (see
		http://www.incanet.se for more information) and by the older
		register platform 'Rockan' (used in the Western and Northern
		part of the country). All variables are coerced to suitable
		classes based on their format. Dates (from various formats such
		as with missing month or day, with or without century prefix or
		with just a week number) are all recognized as dates and
		coerced to the ISO 8601 standard (Y-m-d). Boolean variables
		(internally stored either as 0/1 or "True"/"False"/blanks when
		exported) are coerced to logical. Variable names ending in
		'_Beskrivning' and '_Varde' will be character, and 'PERSNR'
		will be coerced (if possible) to a valid personal
		identification number 'pin' (by the 'sweidnumbr' package). The
		package also allow the user to interactively choose if a
		variable should be coerced into a potential format even though
		not all of its values might conform to the recognized pattern.
		It also contain a caching mechanism in order to temporarily
		store data sets with its newly decided formats in order to not
		rerun the identification process each time. And finally, it
		also include a mechanism to aid the documentation process
		connected to projects build on data from 'INCA'.
