		Quantitative Estimates of Small Ectotherm Temperature Regulation
		Effectiveness // Easy and rapid quantitative estimation of
		small terrestrial ectotherm temperature regulation
		effectiveness in R. ectotemp is built on classical formulas
		that evaluate temperature regulation by means of various
		indices, inaugurated by Hertz et al. (1993) doi:
		10.1086/285573. Options for bootstrapping and permutation
		testing are included to test hypotheses about divergence
		between organisms, species or populations.
