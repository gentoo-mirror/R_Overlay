		Bayesian Model Averaging for Univariate Link Latent Gaussian
		Models // Bayesian model averaging (BMA) algorithms for
		univariate link latent Gaussian models (ULLGMs). For detailed
		information, refer to Steel M.F.J.  Zens G. (2024) "Model
		Uncertainty in Latent Gaussian Models with Univariate Link
		Function" doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.17318. The package supports
		various g-priors and a beta-binomial prior on the model space.
		It also includes auxiliary functions for visualizing and
		tabulating BMA results. Currently, it offers an out-of-the-box
		solution for model averaging of Poisson log-normal (PLN) and
		binomial logistic-normal (BiL) models. The codebase is designed
		to be easily extendable to other likelihoods, priors, and link
		functions.
