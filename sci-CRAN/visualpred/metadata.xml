		Visualization 2D of Binary Classification Models // Visual 2D
		point and contour plots for binary classification modeling
		under algorithms such as glm(), randomForest(), gbm(), nnet()
		and svm(), presented over two dimensions generated by FAMD and
		MCA methods. Package 'FactoMineR' for multivariate reduction
		functions and package 'MBA' for interpolation functions are
		used. The package can be used to visualize the discriminant
		power of input variables and algorithmic modeling, explore
		outliers, compare algorithm behaviour, etc. It has been created
		initially for teaching purposes, but it has also many practical
		uses.
