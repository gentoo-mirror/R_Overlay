		Visualization 2D of Binary Classification Models // Visual
		contour and 2D point and contour plots for binary
		classification modeling under algorithms such as 'glm', 'rf',
		'gbm', 'nnet' and 'svm', presented over two dimensions
		generated by 'famd' and 'mca' methods. Package 'FactoMineR' for
		multivariate reduction functions and package 'MBA' for
		interpolation functions are used. The package can be used to
		visualize the discriminant power of input variables and
		algorithmic modeling, explore outliers, compare algorithm
		behaviour, etc. It has been created initially for teaching
		purposes, but it has also many practical uses under the 'XAI'
		paradigm.
