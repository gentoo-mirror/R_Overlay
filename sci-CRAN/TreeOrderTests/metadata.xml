		Tests for Tree Ordered Alternatives in One-Way ANOVA //
		Implements a likelihood ratio test and two pairwise
		standardized mean difference tests for testing equality of
		means against tree ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA. The
		null hypothesis assumes all group means are equal, while the
		alternative assumes the control mean is less than or equal to
		each treatment mean with at least one strict inequality. Inputs
		are a list of numeric vectors (groups) and a significance
		level; outputs include the test statistic, critical value, and
		decision. Methods described in "Testing Against Tree Ordered
		Alternatives in One-way ANOVA" doi:10.48550/arXiv.2507.17229.
