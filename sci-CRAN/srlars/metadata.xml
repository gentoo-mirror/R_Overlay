		Split Robust Least Angle Regression // Functions to perform split
		robust least angle regression. The approach first uses the
		least angle regression algorithm to split the variables into
		the models of an ensemble and robust estimates of the
		correlation between predictors. An elastic net estimator is
		then applied to the selected predictors in each model using the
		imputed data from the detect deviating cell (DDC) method.
