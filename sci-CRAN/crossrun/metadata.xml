		Joint Distribution of Number of Crossings and Longest Run //
		Joint distribution of number of crossings and the longest run
		in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. The computations
		uses an iterative procedure where computations are based on
		results from shorter series. The procedure conditions on the
		start value and partitions by further conditioning on the
		position of the first crossing (or none).
