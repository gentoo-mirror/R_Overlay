		Correlation and Regression Analyses for Randomized Response Data
		// Univariate and multivariate methods to analyze randomized
		response (RR) survey designs (e.g., Warner, S. L. (1965).
		Randomized response: A survey technique for eliminating evasive
		answer bias. Journal of the American Statistical Association,
		60, 6369, doi:10.2307/2283137). Besides univariate estimates of
		true proportions, RR variables can be used for correlations, as
		dependent variable in a logistic regression (with or without
		random effects), or as predictors in a linear regression (Heck,
		D. W.,  Moshagen, M. (2018). RRreg: An R package for
		correlation and regression analyses of randomized response
		data. Journal of Statistical Software, 85(2), 129,
		doi:10.18637/jss.v085.i02). For simulations and the estimation
		of statistical power, RR data can be generated according to
		several models. The implemented methods also allow to test the
		link between continuous covariates and dishonesty in cheating
		paradigms such as the coin-toss or dice-roll task (Moshagen,
		M.,  Hilbig, B. E. (2017). The statistical analysis of cheating
		paradigms. Behavior Research Methods, 49, 724732,
		doi:10.3758/s13428-016-0729-x).
