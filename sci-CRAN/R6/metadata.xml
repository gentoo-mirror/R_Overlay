		Encapsulated Classes with Reference Semantics // Creates classes
		with reference semantics, similar to R's built-in reference
		classes. Compared to reference classes, R6 classes are simpler
		and lighter-weight, and they are not built on S4 classes so
		they do not require the methods package. These classes allow
		public and private members, and they support inheritance, even
		when the classes are defined in different packages.
