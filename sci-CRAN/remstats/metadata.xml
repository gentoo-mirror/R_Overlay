		Computes Statistics for Relational Event History Data // Computes
		a variety of statistics for relational event models. Relational
		event models enable researchers to investigate both exogenous
		and endogenous factors influencing the evolution of a time-
		ordered sequence of events. These models are categorized into
		tie-oriented models (Butts, C., 2008,
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x), where the probability of
		a dyad interacting next is modeled in a single step, and actor-
		oriented models (Stadtfeld, C.,  Block, P., 2017,
		doi:10.15195/v4.a14), which first model the probability of a
		sender initiating an interaction and subsequently the
		probability of the sender's choice of receiver. The package is
		designed to compute a variety of statistics that summarize
		exogenous and endogenous influences on the event stream for
		both types of models.
