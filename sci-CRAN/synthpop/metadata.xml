		Generating Synthetic Versions of Sensitive Microdata for
		Statistical Disclosure Control // A tool for producing
		synthetic versions of microdata containing confidential
		information so that they are safe to be released to users for
		exploratory analysis. The key objective of generating synthetic
		data is to replace sensitive original values with synthetic
		ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical information
		contained in the data set. Variables, which can be categorical
		or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using sequential
		modelling. Replacements are generated by drawing from
		conditional distributions fitted to the original data using
		parametric or classification and regression trees models. Data
		are synthesised via the function syn() which can be largely
		automated, if default settings are used, or with methods
		defined by the user. Optional parameters can be used to
		influence the disclosure risk and the analytical quality of the
		synthesised data. For a description of the implemented method
		see Nowok, Raab and Dibben (2016) doi:10.18637/jss.v074.i11.
