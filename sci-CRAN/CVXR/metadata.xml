		Disciplined Convex Optimization // An object-oriented modeling
		language for disciplined convex programming (DCP) as described
		in Fu, Narasimhan, and Boyd (2020, doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i14).
		It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems in
		a natural way following mathematical convention and DCP rules.
		The system analyzes the problem, verifies its convexity,
		converts it into a canonical form, and hands it off to an
		appropriate solver to obtain the solution. Interfaces to
		solvers on CRAN and elsewhere are provided, both commercial and
		open source.
