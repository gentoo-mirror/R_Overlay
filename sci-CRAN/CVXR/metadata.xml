		Disciplined Convex Optimization // An object-oriented modeling
		language for disciplined convex programming (DCP). It allows
		the user to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural
		way following mathematical convention and DCP rules. The system
		analyzes the problem, verifies its convexity, converts it into
		a canonical form, and hands it off to an appropriate solver to
		obtain the solution.
