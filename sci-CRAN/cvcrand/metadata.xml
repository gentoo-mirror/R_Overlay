		Efficient Design and Analysis of Cluster Randomized Trials //
		Constrained randomization by Raab and Butcher (2001)
		doi:10.1002/1097-0258(20010215)20:3%3C351::AID-
		SIM797%3E3.0.CO;2-C is suitable for cluster randomized trials
		(CRTs) with a small number of clusters (e.g., 20 or fewer). The
		procedure of constrained randomization is based on the baseline
		values of some cluster-level covariates specified. The
		intervention effect on the individual outcome can then be
		analyzed through clustered permutation test introduced by Gail,
		et al. (1996) doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960615)15:11%3C1069
		::AID-SIM220%3E3.0.CO;2-Q. Motivated from Li, et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1002/sim.7410, the package performs constrained
		randomization on the baseline values of cluster-level
		covariates and cluster permutation test on the individual-level
		outcome for cluster randomized trials.
