		Generate PMML for Various Models // The Predictive Model Markup
		Language (PMML) is an XML-based language which provides a way
		for applications to define statistical and data mining models
		and to share models between PMML compliant applications. More
		information about PMML and the Data Mining Group can be found
		at http:// www.dmg.org. The generated PMML can be imported into
		any PMML consuming application, such as the Software AG
		Zementis scoring engine, which allows for predictive models
		built in R to be deployed and executed on site, in the cloud
		(Amazon, IBM, and FICO), in-database (IBM Netezza, Pivotal,
		Sybase IQ, Teradata and Teradata Aster) or Hadoop (Datameer and
		Hive).
