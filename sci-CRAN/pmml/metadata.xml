		Generate PMML for Various Models // The Predictive Model Markup
		Language (PMML) is an XML-based language which provides a way
		for applications to define machine learning, statistical and
		data mining models and to share models between PMML compliant
		applications. More information about the PMML industry standard
		and the Data Mining Group can be found at http://dmg.org/. The
		generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming
		application, such as Zementis Predictive Analytics products,
		which integrate with web services, relational database systems
		and deploy natively on Hadoop in conjunction with Hive, Spark
		or Storm, as well as allow predictive analytics to be executed
		for IBM z Systems mainframe applications and real-time,
		streaming analytics platforms. The package isofor (used for
		anomaly detection) can be installed with
		devtools::install_github("Zelazny7/isofor").
