		Access to Teaching Materials from a ZIP File or GitHub //
		Teaching materials, e.g. R programs, Shiny apps, data and
		PDF/HTML documents, which are stored on the Internet in a ZIP
		file (e.g. as a GitHub repository) can be downloaded. They can
		be displayed or run locally. The content of the ZIP file is
		temporarily (or permanently) stored. The GitHub repository
		'sigbertklinke/mmstat4.data' is used as the default repository.
		In addition, some auxiliary functions are implemented.
