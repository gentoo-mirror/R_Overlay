		Access to Teaching Materials from a ZIP File or GitHub //
		Provides access to teaching materials for various statistics
		courses, including R programs, Shiny apps, data, and PDF/HTML
		documents. These materials are stored on the Internet as a ZIP
		file (e.g., in a GitHub repository) and can be downloaded and
		displayed or run locally. The content of the ZIP file is
		temporarily or permanently stored. By default, the package uses
		the GitHub repository 'sigbertklinke/mmstat4.data.'
		Additionally, the package includes 'association_measures.R'
		from the archived package 'ryouready' by Mark Heckman and some
		auxiliary functions.
