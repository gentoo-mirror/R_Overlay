		REgularization by Denoising (RED) // Regularization by Denoising
		uses a denoising engine to solve many image reconstruction ill-
		posed inverse problems. This is a R implementation of the
		algorithm developed by Romano et.al. (2016) arXiv:1611.02862.
		Currently, only the gradient descent optimization framework is
		implemented. Also, only the median filter is implemented as a
		denoiser engine. However, (almost) any denoiser engine can be
		plugged in. There are currently available 3 reconstruction
		tasks: denoise, deblur and super-resolution. And again, any
		other task can be easily plugged into the main function 'RED'.
