		Analysis of Multivariate Data and Repeated Measures Designs //
		Implemented are various tests for semi-parametric repeated
		measures and general MANOVA designs that do neither assume
		multivariate normality nor covariance homogeneity, i.e., the
		procedures are applicable for a wide range of general
		multivariate factorial designs. Furthermore, post-hoc
		comparisons are provided for the multivariate analyses.
