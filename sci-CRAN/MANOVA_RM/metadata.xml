		Resampling-Based Analysis of Multivariate Data and Repeated
		Measures Designs // Implemented are various tests for semi-
		parametric repeated measures and general MANOVA designs that do
		neither assume multivariate normality nor covariance
		homogeneity, i.e., the procedures are applicable for a wide
		range of general multivariate factorial designs. In addition to
		asymptotic inference methods, novel bootstrap and permutation
		approaches are implemented as well. These provide more accurate
		results in case of small to moderate sample sizes. Furthermore,
		post-hoc comparisons are provided for the multivariate
		analyses. Friedrich, S., Konietschke, F. and Pauly, M. (2018)
