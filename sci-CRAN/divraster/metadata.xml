		Diversity Metrics Calculations for Rasterized Data // Alpha and
		beta diversity for taxonomic (TD), functional (FD), and
		phylogenetic (PD) dimensions based on rasters. Spatial and
		temporal beta diversity can be partitioned into replacement and
		richness difference components. It also calculates standardized
		effect size for FD and PD alpha diversity and the average
		individual traits across multilayer rasters. The layers of the
		raster represent species, while the cells represent
		communities. Methods details can be found at Cardoso et al.
