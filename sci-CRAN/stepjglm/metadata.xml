		Variable Selection for Joint Modeling of Mean and Dispersion // A
		Package for selecting variables for the joint modeling of mean
		and dispersion (including models for mixture experiments) based
		on hypothesis testing and the quality of model's fit. In each
		iteration of the selection process, a criterion for checking
		the goodness of fit is used as a filter for choosing the terms
		that will be evaluated by a hypothesis test. Pinto  Pereira
