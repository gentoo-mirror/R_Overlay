		The Decision Diffusion Model // Provides functions for computing
		the density, distribution, and random generation of the
		Decision Diffusion model (DDM), a widely used cognitive model
		for analysing choice and response time data. The package allows
		model specification, including the ability to fix, constrain,
		or vary parameters across experimental conditions. While it
		does not include a built-in optimiser, it supports likelihood
		evaluation and can be integrated with external tools for
		parameter estimation. Functions for simulating synthetic
		datasets are also provided. This package is intended for
		researchers modelling speeded decision-making in behavioural
		and cognitive experiments. For more information, see Voss,
		Rothermund, and Voss (2004) doi:10.3758/BF03196893, Voss and
		Voss (2007) doi:10.3758/BF03192967, and Ratcliff and McKoon
		(2008) doi:10.1162/neco.2008.12-06-420.
