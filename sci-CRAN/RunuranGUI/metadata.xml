		A GUI for the UNU.RAN Random Variate Generators // A GUI
		(Graphical User Interface) for the UNU.RAN random variate
		generators. Thus it allows to build non-uniform random number
		generators interactively for quite arbitrary distributions. In
		addition, R code for the required calls from package Runuran
		can be displayed and stored for later use. Some basic analysis
		like goodness-of-fit tests can be performed.
