		Directed Weighted Clustering Coefficient // Allows the
		computation of clustering coefficients for directed and
		weighted networks by using different approaches. It allows to
		compute clustering coefficients that are not present in
		'igraph' package. A description of clustering coefficients can
		be found in "Directed clustering in weighted networks: a new
		perspective", Clemente, G.P., Grassi, R. (2017),
		doi:10.1016/j.chaos.2017.12.007.
