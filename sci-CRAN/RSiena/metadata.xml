		Siena - Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis
		// The main purpose of this package is to perform simulation-
		based estimation of stochastic actor-oriented models for
		longitudinal network data collected as panel data. Dependent
		variables can be single or multivariate networks, which can be
		directed, non-directed, or two-mode; and associated actor
		variables. There are also functions for testing parameters and
		checking goodness of fit. An overview of these models is given
		in Snijders (2017), doi:10.1146/annurev-
		statistics-060116-054035.
