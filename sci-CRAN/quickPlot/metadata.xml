		A System of Plotting Optimized for Speed and Modularity // A
		high-level plotting system, compatible with `ggplot2` objects,
		maps from `sf`, `terra`, `raster`, `sp`. It is built primarily
		on the 'grid' package. The objective of the package is to
		provide a plotting system that is built for speed and
		modularity. This is useful for quick visualizations when
		testing code and for plotting multiple figures to the same
		device from independent sources that may be independent of one
		another (i.e., different function or modules the create the
		visualizations).  The suggested package 'fastshp' can be
		installed from the repository
		(https://PredictiveEcology.r-universe.dev).
