		A System of Plotting Optimized for Speed and Modularity // A
		high-level plotting system, built using 'grid' graphics, that
		is optimized for speed and modularity. This has great utility
		for quick visualizations when testing code, with the key
		benefit that visualizations are updated independently of one
		another.
