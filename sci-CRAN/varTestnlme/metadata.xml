		Variance Components Testing for Linear and Nonlinear Mixed
		Effects Models // An implementation of the Likelihood ratio
		Test (LRT) for testing that, in a (non)linear mixed effects
		model, the variances of a subset of the random effects are
		equal to zero. There is no restriction on the subset of
		variances that can be tested: for example, it is possible to
		test that all the variances are equal to zero. Note that the
		implemented test is asymptotic. This package should be used on
		model fits from packages 'nlme', 'lmer', and 'saemix'.
