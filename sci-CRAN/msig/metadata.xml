		An R Package for Exploring Molecular Signatures Database // The
		Molecular Signatures Database ('MSigDB') is one of the most
		widely used and comprehensive databases of gene sets for
		performing gene set enrichment analysis
		doi:10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004. The 'msig' package provides you
		with powerful, easy-to-use and flexible query functions for the
		'MsigDB' database. There are 2 query modes in the 'msig'
		package: online query and local query. Both queries contain 2
		steps: gene set name and gene. The online search is divided
		into 2 modes: registered search and non-registered browse. For
		registered search, email that you registered should be
		provided. Local queries can be made from local database, which
		can be updated by msig_update() function.
