		Build SVG Custom User Interface // Render SVG as interactive
		figures to display contextual information, with selectable and
		clickable user interface elements. These figures can be
		seamlessly integrated into 'rmarkdown' and 'Quarto' documents,
		as well as 'shiny' applications, allowing manipulation of
		elements and reporting actions performed on them. Additional
		features include pan, zoom in/out functionality, and the
		ability to export the figures in SVG or PNG formats.
