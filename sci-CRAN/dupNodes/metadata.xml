		Computes DNSLbetweenness, a Betweenness Measure that Includes
		Self-Loops // Computes a new measure, DNSL betweenness, via the
		creation of a new graph from an existing one, duplicating nodes
		with self-loops. This betweenness centrality does not drop this
		essential information. Implements Merelo  Molinari (2024)
