		Collapses Levels, Computes Information Value and WoE // Contains
		functions to help in selecting and exploring features ( or
		variables ) in binary classification problems. Provides
		functions to compute and display information value and weight
		of evidence (WoE) of the variables , and to convert numeric
		variables to categorical variables by binning. Functions are
