		Collapses Levels, Computes Information Value and WoE // An update
		to the previous version ( 0.1.0 ) of the package. Functions in
		the previous version required the binary outcome variable of
		the data set to be strictly a factor.In version 0.2.0  the
		binary outcome variable may be both a factor (with two levels)
		or an integer (or numeric ). All functions of the previous
		version have been retained.No new functions have been added.
		Like the previous version,provides functions to collapse the
		levels of an attribute based on response rates. It also
		provides functions to compute and display information value,
		and weight of evidence (WoE) for the attributes, and to convert
		numeric variables to categorical ones by binning. These
		functions only work for binary classification problems.
