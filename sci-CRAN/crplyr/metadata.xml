		A 'dplyr' Interface for Crunch // In order to facilitate analysis
		of datasets hosted on the Crunch data platform
		http://crunch.io/, the 'crplyr' package implements 'dplyr'
		methods on top of the Crunch backend. The usual methods
		"select", "filter", "mutate", "group_by", and "summarize" are
		implemented in such a way as to perform as much computation on
		the server and pull as little data locally as possible.
