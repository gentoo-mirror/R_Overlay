		Plotting N-T Plane for Decision on Performing an Interim Analysis
		// In randomized-controlled trials, interim analyses are often
		planned for possible early trial termination to claim
		superiority or futility of a new therapy. Blinded data also
		have information about the potential treatment difference
		between the groups. We developed a blinded data monitoring tool
		that enables investigators to predict whether they observe such
		an unblinded interim analysis results that supports early
		termination of the trial. Investigators may skip some of the
		planned interim analyses if an early termination is unlikely.
		This tool will provide reference information about N: Sample
		size at interim analysis, and T: Total number of responders at
		interim analysis for decision on performing an interim
		analysis.
