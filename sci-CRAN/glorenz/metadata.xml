		Transformed and Relative Lorenz Curves for Survey Weighted Data
		// Functions for constructing Transformed and Relative Lorenz
		curves with survey sampling weights. Given a variable of
		interest measured in two groups with scaled survey weights so
		that their hypothetical populations are of equal size,
		tlorenz() computes the proportion of members of the group with
		smaller values (ordered from smallest to largest) needed for
		their sum to match the sum of the top qth percentile of the
		group with higher values. rlorenz() shows the fraction of the
		total value of the group with larger values held by the pth
		percentile of those in the group with smaller values. Fd() is a
		survey weighted cumulative distribution function and Eps() is a
		survey weighted inverse cdf used in rlorenz(). Ramos, Graubard,
		and Gastwirth (2025) doi:10.1093/jrsssa/qnaf044.
