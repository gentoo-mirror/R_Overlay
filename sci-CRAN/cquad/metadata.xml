		Conditional Maximum Likelihood for Quadratic Exponential Models
		for Binary Panel Data // Estimation, based on conditional
		maximum likelihood, of the quadratic exponential model proposed
		by Bartolucci, F.  Nigro, V. (2010, Econometrica) and of a
		simplified and a modified version of this model. The quadratic
		exponential model is suitable for the analysis of binary
		longitudinal data when state dependence (further to the effect
		of the covariates and a time-fixed individual intercept) has to
		be taken into account. Therefore, this is an alternative to the
		dynamic logit model having the advantage of easily allowing
		conditional inference in order to eliminate the individual
		intercepts and then getting consistent estimates of the
		parameters of main interest (for the covariates and the lagged
		response). The simplified version of this model does not
		distinguish, as the original model does, between the last time
		occasion and the previous occasions. The modified version
		formulates in a different way the interaction terms and it may
		be used to test in a easy way state dependence as shown in
		Bartolucci, F., Nigro, V.  Pigini, C. (2013, Econometric
		Reviews). The package also includes estimation of the dynamic
		logit model by a pseudo conditional estimator based on the
		quadratic exponential model, as proposed by Bartolucci, F.
		Nigro, V. (2012, Journal of Econometrics).
