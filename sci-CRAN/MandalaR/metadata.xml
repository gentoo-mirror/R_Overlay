		Building Mandalas from Parametric Equations of Classical Curves
		// Provides an algorithm for creating mandalas. From the
		perspective of classic mathematical curves and rigid movements
		on the plane, the package allows you to select curves and
		produce mandalas from the curve. The algorithm was developed
		based on the book by Alcoforado et. al. entitled "Art, Geometry
		and Mandalas with R" (2022) in press by the USP Open Books
		Portal.
