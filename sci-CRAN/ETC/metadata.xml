		Equivalence to Control // Treatments of a one-way layout, being
		equivalent to a control, can be selected with this package.
		Bonferroni adjusted "two one-sided t-tests" (TOST) and related
		simultaneous confidence intervals are given for both
		differences or ratios of means of normally distributed data.
		For the case of equal variances and balanced sample sizes for
		the treatment groups, the single-step procedure of Bofinger and
		Bofinger (1995) doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02058.x can be
		chosen. For non-normal data, the Wilcoxon test is applied.
