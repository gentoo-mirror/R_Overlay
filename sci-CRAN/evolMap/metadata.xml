		Dynamic and Interactive Maps // Dynamic and Interactive Maps with
		R, powered by 'leaflet' https://leafletjs.com. 'evolMap'
		generates a web page with interactive and dynamic maps to which
		you can add geometric entities (points, lines or colored
		geographic areas), and/or markers with optional links between
		them. The dynamic ability of these maps allows their components
		to evolve over a continuous period of time or by periods.
