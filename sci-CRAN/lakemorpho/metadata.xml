		Lake Morphometry Metrics in R // Lake morphometry metrics are
		used by limnologists to understand, among other things, the
		ecological processes in a lake. Traditionally, these metrics
		are calculated by hand, with planimeters, and increasingly with
		commercial GIS products. All of these methods work; however,
		they are either outdated, difficult to reproduce, or require
		expensive licenses to use. The lakemorpho package provides the
		tools to calculate a typical suite of these metrics from an
		input elevation model and lake polygon. The metrics currently
		supported are: fetch, major axis, minor axis,  maximum length,
		maximum width, mean width,maximum depth, mean depth, shoreline
		development, shoreline length, surface area, and volume.
