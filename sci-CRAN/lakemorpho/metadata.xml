		Lake Morphometry Metrics // Lake morphometry metrics are used by
		limnologists to understand, among other things, the ecological
		processes in a lake. Traditionally, these metrics are
		calculated by hand, with planimeters, and increasingly with
		commercial GIS products. All of these methods work; however,
		they are either outdated, difficult to reproduce, or require
		expensive licenses to use. The 'lakemorpho' package provides
		the tools to calculate a typical suite of these metrics from an
		input elevation model and lake polygon. The metrics currently
		supported are: fetch, major axis, minor axis, major/minor axis
		ratio, maximum length, maximum width, mean width, maximum
		depth, mean depth, shoreline development, shoreline length,
		surface area, and volume.
