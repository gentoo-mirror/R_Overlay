		Mixed-Effects REML Incorporating Generalized Inverses // Fit
		linear mixed-effects models using restricted (or residual)
		maximum likelihood (REML) and with generalized inverse matrices
		to specify covariance structures for random effects. In
		particular, the package is suited to fit quantitative genetic
		mixed models, often referred to as 'animal models'. Implements
		the average information algorithm as the main tool to maximize
		the restricted log-likelihood, but with other algorithms
		available.
