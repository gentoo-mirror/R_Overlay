		Mixed-Effects REML Incorporating Generalized Inverses // Fit
		linear mixed-effects models using restricted (or residual)
		maximum likelihood (REML) and with generalized inverse matrices
		to specify covariance structures for random effects. In
		particular, the package is suited to fit quantitative genetic
		mixed models, often referred to as 'animal models' (Kruuk. 2004
		DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2003.1437). Implements the average
		information algorithm as the main tool to maximize the
		restricted likelihood, but with other algorithms available
		(Meyer. 1997. Genet Sel Evol 29:97; Meyer and Smith. 1998.
		Genet Sel Evol 28:23.).
