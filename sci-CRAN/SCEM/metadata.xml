		Splitting-Coalescence-Estimation Method // We introduce improved
		methods for statistically assessing birth seasonality and
		intra-annual variation. The first method we propose is a new
		idea that uses a nonparametric clustering procedure to group
		individuals with similar time series data and estimate birth
		seasonality based on the clusters. One can use the function
		SCEM() to implement this method. The second method estimates
		input parameters for use with a previously-developed parametric
		approach (Tornero et al., 2013). The relevant code for this
		approach is makeFits_OLS(), while makeFits_initial() is the
		code to implement the same method but with given initial
		conditions for two parameters. The latter can be used to show
		the disadvantage of the existing approach. One can use the
		function makeFits() to generate parametric birth seasonality
		estimates using either initialization. Detailed description can
		be found here: Chazin Hannah, Soudeep Deb, Joshua Falk, and
		Arun Srinivasan. (2019) "New Statistical Approaches to Intra-
		Individual Isotopic Analysis and Modeling Birth Seasonality in
		Studies of Herd Animals." doi:10.1111/arcm.12432.
