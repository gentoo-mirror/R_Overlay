		Encapsulating Elements of Experimental Design // A system to
		facilitate designing comparative experiments using the grammar
		of experimental designs https://emitanaka.org/edibble-book/. An
		experimental design is treated as an intermediate, mutable
		object that is built progressively by fundamental experimental
		components like units, treatments, and their relation. The
		system aids in experimental planning, management and workflow.
