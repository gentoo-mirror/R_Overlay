		Phylogenetic Tree Statistics // Collection of phylogenetic tree
		statistics, collected throughout the literature. All functions
		have been written to maximize computation speed. The package
		includes umbrella functions to calculate all statistics, all
		balance associated statistics, or all branching time related
		statistics. Furthermore, the 'treestats' package supports
		summary statistic calculations on Ltables, provides speed-
		improved coding of branching times, Ltable conversion and
		includes algorithms to create intermediately balanced trees.
