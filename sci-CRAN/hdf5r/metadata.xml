		Interface to the 'HDF5' Binary Data Format // 'HDF5' is a data
		model, library and file format for storing and managing large
		amounts of data. This package provides a nearly feature
		complete, object oriented  wrapper for the 'HDF5' API
		https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5Front.html using
		R6 classes. Additionally, functionality is added so that 'HDF5'
		objects behave very similar to their corresponding R
		counterparts.
