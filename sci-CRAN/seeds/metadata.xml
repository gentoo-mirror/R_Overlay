		Estimate Hidden Inputs using the Dynamic Elastic Net //
		Algorithms to calculate the hidden inputs of systems of
		differential equations. These hidden inputs can be interpreted
		as a control that tries to minimize the discrepancies between a
		given model and taken measurements. The idea is also called the
		Dynamic Elastic Net, as proposed in the paper "Learning (from)
		the errors of a systems biology model" (Engelhardt, Froelich,
		Kschischo 2016) doi:10.1038/srep20772. To use the experimental
		SBML import function, the 'rsbml' package is required. For
		installation I refer to the official 'rsbml' page:
		https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rsbml.html.
