		Create Badges for 'Travis', 'Repostatus' 'Codecov.io' Etc in
		Github Readme // Tired of copy and pasting almost identical
		markdown for badges in every new R-package that you create, on
		Github or other code-sharing sites? This package allows you to
		easily paste badges. If you want to, it will also search your
		DESCRIPTION file and extract the package name, license,
		R-version, and current projectversion and transform that into
		badges. It will also search for a ".travis.yml" file and create
		a "Travis"" badge, if you use "Codecov.io" to check your code
		coverage after a "Travis" build this package will also build a
		"Codecov.io"-badge. All the badges can be placed individually
		or can be placed below the top "YAML"" content of your
		"RMarkdown file" (Readme.Rmd) or "README.md" file. Currently
		creates badges for  Projectstatus ("Repostatus.org"), license
		Travis Build Status, Codecov, Minimal R version, CRAN status,
		CRAN downloads, Github stars and forks, Package rank,
		rdocumentation, current version of your package and last change
		of "README.Rmd".
