		Bindings for 'Mapbox' Ear Cutting Triangulation Library //
		Provides constrained triangulation of polygons. Ear cutting (or
		ear clipping) applies constrained triangulation by successively
		'cutting' triangles from a polygon defined by path/s. Holes are
		supported by introducing a bridge segment between polygon
		paths. This package wraps the 'header-only' library
		'earcut.hpp' https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp.git which
		includes a reference to the method used by Held, M. (2001)
		doi:10.1007/s00453-001-0028-4.
