		Access Reactive Data Interactively // Troubleshooting reactive
		data in 'shiny' can be difficult. These functions will convert
		reactive data frames into functions and load all assigned
		objects into your local environment. If you create a dummy
		input object, as the function will suggest, you will be able to
		test your server and ui functions interactively.
