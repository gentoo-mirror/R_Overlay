		Scale-Dependent Hyperpriors in Structured Additive Distributional
		Regression // Utility functions for scale-dependent and
		alternative hyperpriors. The distribution parameters may
		capture location, scale, shape, etc. and every parameter may
		depend on complex additive terms (fixed, random, smooth,
		spatial, etc.) similar to a generalized additive model.
		Hyperpriors for all effects can be elicitated within the
		package. Including complex tensor product interaction terms and
		variable selection priors. The basic model is explained in in
		Klein and Kneib (2016) doi:10.1214/15-BA983.
