		Estimation of Forest Variables using the FIA Database // The goal
		of 'rFIA' is to increase the accessibility and use of the
		United States Forest Services (USFS) Forest Inventory and
		Analysis (FIA) Database by providing a user-friendly, open
		source toolkit to easily query and analyze FIA Data. Designed
		to accommodate a wide range of potential user objectives,
		'rFIA' simplifies the estimation of forest variables from the
		FIA Database and allows all R users (experts and newcomers
		alike) to unlock the flexibility inherent to the Enhanced FIA
		design. Specifically, 'rFIA' improves accessibility to the
		spatial-temporal estimation capacity of the FIA Database by
		producing space-time indexed summaries of forest variables
		within user-defined population boundaries. Direct integration
		with other popular R packages (e.g., 'dplyr', 'tidyr', and
		'sf') facilitates efficient space-time query and data summary,
		and supports common data representations and API design. The
		package implements design-based estimation procedures outlined
		by Bechtold  Patterson (2005) doi:10.2737/SRS-GTR-80, and has
		been validated against estimates and sampling errors produced
		by FIA 'EVALIDator'. Current development is focused on the
		implementation of spatially-enabled model-assisted estimators
		to improve population, change, and ratio estimates.
