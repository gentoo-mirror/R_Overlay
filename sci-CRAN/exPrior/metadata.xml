		Prior Distributions Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Framework //
		The aim of this package is to provide practitioners of
		statistics in geology, hydrology, etc. a tool to derive prior
		distributions for Bayesian inference. Prior distributions
		summarize knowledge from studies at similar sites. The main
		features of the package are to (i) generate prior distributions
		based on external data only; (ii) to account for possible
		autocorrelation in the data, and (iii) to account for available
		soft data, say, in the form of expert information on bounds and
		moments.
