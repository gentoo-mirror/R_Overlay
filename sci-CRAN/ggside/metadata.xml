		Side Grammar Graphics // The grammar of graphics as shown in
		'ggplot2' has provided an expressive API for users to build
		plots. 'ggside' extends 'ggplot2' by allowing users to add
		graphical information about one of the main panel's axis using
		a familiar 'ggplot2' style API with tidy data. This package is
		particularly useful for visualising metadata on a discrete
		axis, or summary graphics on a continuous axis such as a
		boxplot or a density distribution.
