		Best Orthogonalized Subset Selection (BOSS) // Best
		Orthogonalized Subset Selection (BOSS) is a least-squares (LS)
		based subset selection method, that performs best subset
		selection upon an orthogonalized basis of ordered predictors,
		with the computational effort of a single ordinary LS fit. This
		package provides a highly optimized implementation of BOSS and
		estimates a heuristic degrees of freedom for BOSS, which can be
		plugged into an information criterion (IC) such as AICc in
		order to select the subset from candidates. It provides various
		choices of IC, including AIC, BIC, AICc, Cp and GCV. It also
		implements the forward stepwise selection (FS) with no
		additional computational cost, where the subset of FS is
		selected via cross-validation (CV). CV is also an option for
		BOSS. For details see: Tian, Hurvich and Simonoff (2021), "On
		the Use of Information Criteria for Subset Selection in Least
		Squares Regression", arXiv:1911.10191.
