		Semiparametric Latent Class Analysis for Recurrent Event // An
		easy-to-use tool for latent class analysis for recurrent
		events. The modeling framework is based on the semiparametric
		multiplicative modeling in Zhao et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1111/rssb.12499. Our package provides an alternative
		method to define initial values in the estimation algorithm
		based on a joint frailty scale-change model described in Wang
		et al. (2001) doi:10.1198/016214501753209031 and K-means. Users
		are also allowed to specify different initial values by
		themselves. Our package also provides an alternative algorithm
		to solving the estimating equation for unobservable latent
		class membership by fitting a "pseudo" weighted multinomial
		regression which speeds up the rate of convergence.
