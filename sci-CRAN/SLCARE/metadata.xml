		Semiparametric Latent Class Analysis of Recurrent Events //
		Efficient R package for latent class analysis of recurrent
		events, based on the semiparametric multiplicative intensity
		model by Zhao et al. (2022) doi:10.1111/rssb.12499. SLCARE
		returns estimates for non-functional model parameters along
		with the associated variance estimates and p-values.
		Visualization tools are provided to depict the estimated
		functional model parameters and related functional quantities
		of interest. SLCARE also delivers a model checking plot to help
		assess the adequacy of the fitted model.
