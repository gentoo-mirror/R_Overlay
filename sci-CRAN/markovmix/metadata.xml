		Mixture of Markov Chains with Support of Higher Orders and
		Multiple Sequences // Fit mixture of Markov chains of higher
		orders from multiple sequences. It is also compatible with
		ordinary 1-component, 1-order or single-sequence Markov chains.
		Various utility functions are provided to derive transition
		patterns, transition probabilities per component and component
		priors. In addition, print(), predict() and component
		extracting/replacing methods are also defined as a convention
		of mixture models.
