		Predictive Probability for a Continuous Response with an ANOVA
		Structure // A Bayesian approach to using predictive
		probability in an ANOVA construct with a continuous normal
		response, when threshold values must be obtained for the
		question of interest to be evaluated as successful (Sieck and
		Christensen (2021) doi:10.1002/qre.2802). The Bayesian Mission
		Mean (BMM) is used to evaluate a question of interest (that is,
		a mean that randomly selects combination of factor levels based
		on their probability of occurring instead of averaging over the
		factor levels, as in the grand mean). Under this construct, in
		contrast to a Gibbs sampler (or Metropolis-within-Gibbs
		sampler), a two-stage sampling method is required. The nested
		sampler determines the conditional posterior distribution of
		the model parameters, given Y, and the outside sampler
		determines the marginal posterior distribution of Y (also
		commonly called the predictive distribution for Y). This
		approach provides a sample from the joint posterior
		distribution of Y and the model parameters, while also
		accounting for the threshold value that must be obtained in
		order for the question of interest to be evaluated as
		successful.
