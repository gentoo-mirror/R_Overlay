		Cross-Quantilogram // Estimation and inference methods for the
		cross-quantilogram. The cross-quantilogram is a measure of
		nonlinear dependence between two variables, based on either
		unconditional or conditional quantile functions.  The cross-
		quantilogram can be considered as an extension of the
		correlogram, which is a correlation function over multiple lag
		periods and mainly focuses on linear dependency.  One can use
		the cross-quantilogram to detect the presence of directional
		predictability from one time series to another.  This package
		provides a statistical inference method based on the stationary
		bootstrap.  See Linton and Whang (2007)
		doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.01.004 for univariate time series
		analysis and Han, Linton, Oka and Whang (2016)
		doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.03.001 for multivariate time series
		analysis.
