		Cross-Quantilogram // Estimation and inference methods for the
		cross-quantilogram. The cross-quantilogram is a measure of
		nonlinear dependence between two variables, based on either
		unconditional or conditional quantile functions.  It can be
		considered an extension of the correlogram, which is a
		correlation function over multiple lag periods that mainly
		focuses on linear dependency.  One can use the cross-
		quantilogram to detect the presence of directional
		predictability from one time series to another.  This package
		provides a statistical inference method based on the stationary
		bootstrap.  For detailed theoretical and empirical
		explanations, see Linton and Whang (2007) for univariate time
		series analysis and Han, Linton, Oka and Whang (2016) for
		multivariate time series analysis.  The full references for
		these key publications are as follows: (1) Linton, O., and
		Whang, Y. J. (2007). The quantilogram: with an application to
		evaluating directional predictability.  Journal of
		Econometrics, 141(1), 250-282
