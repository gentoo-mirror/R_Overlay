		Convolution-Type Smoothed Quantile Regression // Estimation and
		inference for conditional linear quantile regression models
		using a convolution smoothed approach. In the low-dimensional
		setting, efficient gradient-based methods are employed for
		fitting both a single model and a regression process over a
		quantile range. Normal-based and (multiplier) bootstrap
		confidence intervals for all slope coefficients are
		constructed. In high dimensions, the conquer method is
		complemented with flexible types of penalties (Lasso, elastic-
		net, group lasso, sparse group lasso, scad and mcp) to deal
		with complex low-dimensional structures.
