		Convolution-Type Smoothed Quantile Regression // Estimation and
		inference for conditional linear quantile regression models
		using a convolution smoothed approach. In the low-dimensional
		setting, efficient gradient-based methods are employed for
		fitting both a single model and a regression process over a
		quantile range. Normal-based and (multiplier) bootstrap
		confidence intervals for all slope coefficients are
		constructed. In high dimensions, the conquer methods
		complemented with l_1-penalization and iteratively reweighted
		l_1-penalization are used to fit sparse models.
