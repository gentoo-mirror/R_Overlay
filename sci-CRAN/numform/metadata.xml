		Tools to Format Numbers for Publication // Format numbers and
		plots for publication; includes the removal of leading zeros,
		standardization of number of digits, addition of affixes, and a
		p-value formatter. These tools combine the functionality of
		several 'base' functions such as paste(), format(), and
		sprintf() into specific use case functions that are named in a
		way that is consistent with usage, making their names easy to
		remember and easy to deploy.
