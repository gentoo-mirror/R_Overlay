		Neo-Normal Distribution // Calculating the density, cumulative
		distribution, quantile, and random number of neo-normal
		distribution. It also interfaces with the 'brms' package,
		allowing the use of the neo-normal distribution as a custom
		family. This integration enables the application of various
		'brms' formulas for neo-normal regression.  Modified to be
		Stable as Normal from Burr (MSNBurr), Modified to be Stable as
		Normal from Burr-IIa (MSNBurr-IIa), Generalized of MSNBurr
		(GMSNBurr), Jones-Faddy Skew-t, Fernandez-Osiewalski-Steel Skew
		Exponential Power, and Jones Skew Exponential Power
		distributions are supported. References: Choir, A. S.
