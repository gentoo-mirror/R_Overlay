		Matching and Weighting Multiply Imputed Datasets // Provides the
		necessary tools for the pre-processing techniques of matching
		and weighting multiply imputed datasets to control for effects
		of confounders and to reduce the degree of dependence on
		certain modeling assumptions in studying the causal
		associations between an exposure and an outcome. This package
		includes functions to perform matching within and across the
		multiply imputed datasets using several matching methods, to
		estimate weights of units in the imputed datasets using several
		weighting methods, to calculate the causal effect estimate in
		each matched or weighted dataset using parametric or non-
		parametric statistical models, and to pool the obtained
		estimates from these models according to Rubin's rules (please
		see https://github.com/FarhadPishgar/MatchThem for details).
