		Matching and Weighting Multiply Imputed Datasets // Provides
		essential tools for the pre-processing techniques of matching
		and weighting multiply imputed datasets. The package includes
		functions for matching within and across multiply imputed
		datasets using various methods, estimating weights for units in
		the imputed datasets using multiple weighting methods,
		calculating causal effect estimates in each matched or weighted
		dataset using parametric or non-parametric statistical models,
		and pooling the resulting estimates according to Rubin's rules
		(please see
		https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2021/RJ-2021-073/ for
		more details).
