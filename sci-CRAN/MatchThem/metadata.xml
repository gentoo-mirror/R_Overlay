		Matching Multiply Imputed Datasets // Provides the necessary
		tools for the pre-processing technique of matching in multiply
		imputed datasets, to improve the robustness and transparency of
		deriving causal inferences from studying these datasets. This
		package includes functions to perform propensity score matching
		within or across the imputed datasets as well as to estimate
		weights (including inverse propensity score weights) of
		observations, to analyze each matched or weighted datasets
		using parametric or non-parametric statistical models, and to
		combine the obtained results from these models according to
		Rubins rules. Please see the package repository
		https://github.com/FarhadPishgar/MatchThem for details.
