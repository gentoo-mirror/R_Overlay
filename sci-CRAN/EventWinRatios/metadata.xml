		Event-Specific Win Ratios for Terminal and Non-Terminal Events //
		Provides several confidence interval and testing procedures
		using event-specific win ratios for semi-competing risks data
		with non-terminal and terminal events, as developed in Yang et
		al. (2021doi:10.1002/sim.9266). Compared with conventional
		methods for survival data, these procedures are designed to
		utilize more data for improved inference procedures with semi-
		competing risks data. The event-specific win ratios were
		introduced in Yang and Troendle
		(2021doi:10.1177/1740774520972408). In this package, the event-
		specific win ratios and confidence intervals are obtained for
		each event type, and several testing procedures are developed
		for the global null of no treatment effect on either terminal
		or non-terminal events. Furthermore, a test of proportional
		hazard assumptions, under which the event-specific win ratios
		converge to the hazard ratios, and a test of equal hazard
		ratios are provided. For summarizing the treatment effect on
		all events, confidence intervals for linear combinations of the
		event-specific win ratios are available using pre-determined or
		data-driven weights. Asymptotic properties of these inference
		procedures are discussed in Yang et al
		(2021doi:10.1002/sim.9266). Also, transformations are used to
		yield better control of the type one error rates for moderately
		sized data sets.
