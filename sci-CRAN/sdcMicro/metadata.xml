		Statistical Disclosure Control Methods for Anonymization of Data
		and Risk Estimation // Data from statistical agencies and other
		institutions are mostly confidential. This package (see also
		Templ, Kowarik and Meindl (2017) doi:10.18637/jss.v067.i04) can
		be used for the generation of anonymized (micro)data, i.e. for
		the creation of public- and scientific-use files. The
		theoretical basis for the methods implemented can be found in
		Templ (2017) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-50272-4. Various risk
		estimation and anonymisation methods are included. Note that
		the package includes a graphical user interface (Meindl and
		Templ, 2019 doi:10.3390/a12090191) that allows to use various
		methods of this package.
