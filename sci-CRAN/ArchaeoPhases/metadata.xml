		Post-Processing of the Markov Chain Simulated by 'ChronoModel',
		'Oxcal' or 'BCal' // Provides a list of functions for the
		statistical analysis of archaeological dates and groups of
		dates. It is based on the post-processing of the Markov Chains
		whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of
		a series of dates. Such output can be simulated by different
		applications as for instance 'ChronoModel' (see
		https://chronomodel.com/), 'Oxcal' (see
		https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) or 'BCal' (see
		https://bcal.shef.ac.uk/). The only requirement is to have a
		csv file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.
		Note that this package interacts with data available through
		the 'ArchaeoPhases.dataset' package which is available in a
		separate repository.  The size of the 'ArchaeoPhases.dataset'
		package is approximately 4 MB.
