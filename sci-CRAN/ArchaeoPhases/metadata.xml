		Post-Processing of Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulations for
		Chronological Modelling // Statistical analysis of
		archaeological dates and groups of dates. This package allows
		to post-process Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations
		from 'ChronoModel' https://chronomodel.com/, 'Oxcal'
		https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html or 'BCal'
		https://bcal.shef.ac.uk/. It provides functions for the study
		of rhythms of the long term from the posterior distribution of
		a series of dates (tempo and activity plot). It also allows the
		estimation and visualization of time ranges from the posterior
		distribution of groups of dates (e.g. duration, transition and
		hiatus between successive phases) as described in Philippe and
		Vibet (2020) doi:10.18637/jss.v093.c01.
