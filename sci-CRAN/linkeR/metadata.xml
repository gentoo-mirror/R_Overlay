		Link Interactive Plots and Tables in 'shiny' Applications //
		Build powerful, linked-view dashboards in 'shiny' applications.
		With a declarative, one-line setup, you can create
		bidirectional links between interactive components. When a user
		interacts with one element (e.g., clicking a map marker), all
		linked components (such as 'DT' tables or other charts)
		instantly update. Supports 'leaflet' maps, 'DT' tables,
		'plotly' charts, and spatial data via 'sf' objects out-of-the-
		box, with an extensible API for custom components.
