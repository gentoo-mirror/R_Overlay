		Cox Model with Interval-Censored Starting Time of a Covariate //
		Calibration and risk-set calibration methods for fitting Cox
		proportional hazard model when a binary covariate is measured
		intermittently. Methods include functions to fit calibration
		models from interval-censored data and modified partial
		likelihood for the proportional hazard model, Nevo et al.
