		Hidden Hybrid Markov/Semi-Markov Model Fitting // Develops
		algorithms for fitting, prediction, simulation and
		initialization of the hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov model,
		introduced by Guedon (2005) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2004.05.033,
		which also includes several tools for handling missing data,
		fitting regime sweaching regression and auto-regressive hidden
