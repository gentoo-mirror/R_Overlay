		Models and Tests for Departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
		and Independence Between Loci // Fits models for genotypic
		disequilibria, as described in Huttley and Wilson (2000)
		doi:10.1093/genetics/156.4.2127, Weir (1996) and Weir and
		Wilson (1986). Contrast terms are available that account for
		first order interactions between loci.  Also implements, for a
		single locus in a single population, a conditional exact test
		for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
