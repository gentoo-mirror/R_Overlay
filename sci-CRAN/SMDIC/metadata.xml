		Identification of Somatic Mutation-Driven Immune Cells // A
		computing tool is developed to automated identify somatic
		mutation-driven immune cells. The operation modes including: i)
		inferring the relative abundance matrix of tumor-infiltrating
		immune cells and integrating it with a particular gene mutation
		status, ii) detecting differential immune cells with respect to
		the gene mutation status and converting the abundance matrix of
		significant differential immune cell into two binary matrices
		(one for up-regulated and one for down-regulated), iii)
		identifying somatic mutation-driven immune cells by comparing
		the gene mutation status with each immune cell in the binary
		matrices across all samples, and iv) visualization of immune
		cell abundance of samples in different mutation status.
