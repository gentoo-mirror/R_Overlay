		CONCOR and Supplemental Functions // Contains the CONCOR
		(CONvergence of iterated CORrelations) algorithm and a series
		of supplemental functions for easy running, plotting, and
		blockmodeling. The CONCOR algorithm is used on social network
		data to identify network positions based off a definition of
		structural equivalence; see Breiger, Boorman, and Arabie (1975)
		doi:10.1016/0022-2496(75)90028-0 and Wasserman and Faust's book
		Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications (1994). This
		version allows multiple relationships for the same set of nodes
		and uses both incoming and outgoing ties to find positions.
