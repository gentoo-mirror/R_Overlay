		Selection and Ranking of Omics Biomarkers Combinations Made Easy
		// Provides functions and a workflow to easily and powerfully
		calculating specificity, sensitivity and ROC curves of
		biomarkers combinations. Allows to rank and select multi-
		markers signatures as well as to find the best performing sub-
		signatures, now also from single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The
		method used was first published as a Shiny app and described in
		Mazzara et al. (2017) doi:10.1038/srep45477 and further
		described in Bombaci  Rossi (2019)
		doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-9164-8_16, and widely expanded as a
		package as presented in the bioRxiv pre print Ferrari et al.
		doi:10.1101/2022.01.17.476603.
