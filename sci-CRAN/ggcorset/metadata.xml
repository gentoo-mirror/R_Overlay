		The Corset Plot // Corset plots are a new visualization
		technique, which are used strictly to visualize repeat measures
		at 2 time points (such as pre- and post- data). The
		distribution of measurements at each time point are visualized
		using half violins, whilst the trajectories of individual
		change are visualized via spaghetti plots by connecting these
		two points linearly. These lines can be coloured to represent
		percent change or other user-defined value. This method of
		visualization is ideal for showing the heterogeneity of data,
		including differences by sub-groups. The package relies on
		'ggplot2' allowing for easy integration so that users can
		customize their visualizations as required. Users can create
		corset plots using data in either wide or long format using the
		functions gg_corset() or gg_corset_elongated(), respectively.
