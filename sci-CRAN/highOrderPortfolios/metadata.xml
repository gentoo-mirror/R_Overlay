		Design of High-Order Portfolios Including Skewness and Kurtosis
		// The classical Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio
		formulation ignores heavy tails and skewness. High-order
		portfolios use higher order moments to better characterize the
		return distribution. Different formulations and fast algorithms
		are proposed for high-order portfolios based on the mean,
		variance, skewness, and kurtosis. The package is based on the
		papers: R. Zhou and D. P. Palomar (2021). "Solving High-Order
		Portfolios via Successive Convex Approximation Algorithms."

		via Parametric Skew-t Distribution." arXiv:2206.02412.
