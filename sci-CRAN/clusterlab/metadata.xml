		Flexible Gaussian Cluster Simulator // Clustering is a central
		task in big data analyses and clusters are often Gaussian or
		near Gaussian. However, a flexible Gaussian cluster simulation
		tool with precise control over the size, variance, and spacing
		of the clusters in NXN dimensional space does not exist. This
		is why we created 'clusterlab'. The algorithm first creates X
		points equally spaced on the circumference of a circle in 2D
		space. These form the centers of each cluster to be simulated.
		Additional samples are added by adding Gaussian noise to each
		cluster center and concatenating the new sample co-ordinates.
		Then if the feature space is greater than 2D, the generated
		points are considered principal component scores and projected
		into N dimensional space using linear combinations using fixed
		eigenvectors. Through using vector rotations and scalar
		multiplication clusterlab can generate complex patterns of
		Gaussian clusters and outliers.
