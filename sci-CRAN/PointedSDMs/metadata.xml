		Fit Models Derived from Point Processes to Species Distributions
		using 'inlabru' // Integrated species distribution modeling is
		a rising field in quantitative ecology thanks to significant
		rises in the quantity of data available, increases in
		computational speed and the proven benefits of using such
		models. Despite this, the general software to help ecologists
		construct such models in an easy-to-use framework is lacking.
		We therefore introduce the R package 'PointedSDMs': which
		provides the tools to help ecologists set up integrated models
		and perform inference on them. There are also functions within
		the package to help run spatial cross-validation for model
		selection, as well as generic plotting and predicting
		functions. An introduction to these methods is discussed in
		Issac, Jarzyna, Keil, Dambly, Boersch-Supan, Browning, Freeman,
		Golding, Guillera-Arroita, Henrys, Jarvis, Lahoz-Monfort,
		Pagel, Pescott, Schmucki, Simmonds and OHara (2020)
