		Real Datasets for Assessing Ecological Inference Algorithms //
		Provides more than 550 data sets of actual election results.
		Each of the data sets includes aggregate party and candidate
		outcomes at the voting unit (polling stations) level and two-
		way cross-tabulated results at the district level. These data
		sets can be used to assess ecological inference algorithms
		devised for estimating RxC (global) ecological contingency
		tables using exclusively aggregate results from voting units.
