		Cost-Sensitive Multi-Class Classification // Reduction-based
		techniques for cost-sensitive multi-class classification, in
		which each observation has a different cost for classifying it
		into one class, and the goal is to predict the class with the
		minimum expected cost for each new observation. Implements
		Weighted All-Pairs (Beygelzimer, A., Langford, J.,  Zadrozny,
		B., 2008, doi:10.1007/978-0-387-79361-0_1), Weighted One-Vs-
		Rest (Beygelzimer, A., Dani, V., Hayes, T., Langford, J.,
		Zadrozny, B., 2005, https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1102358)
		and Regression One-Vs-Rest. Works with arbitrary classifiers
		taking observation weights, or with regressors. Also implements
		cost-proportionate rejection sampling for working with
		classifiers that don't accept observation weights.
