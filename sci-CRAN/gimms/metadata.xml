		Download and Process GIMMS NDVI3g Data // This is a set of
		functions to retrieve information about GIMMS NDVI3g files
		currently available online; download (and re-arrange, in the
		case of NDVI3g.v0) the half-monthly data sets; import
		downloaded files from ENVI binary (NDVI3g.v0) or NetCDF format
		(NDVI3g.v1) directly into R based on the widespread 'raster'
		package; conduct quality control; and generate monthly
		composites (e.g., maximum values) from the half-monthly input
		data. As a special gimmick, a method is included to
		conveniently apply the Mann-Kendall trend test upon 'Raster*'
		images, optionally featuring trend-free pre-whitening to
		account for lag-1 autocorrelation.
