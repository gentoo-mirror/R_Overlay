		Calculate Key DHS Indicators // Calculates key indicators such as
		fertility rates (Total Fertility Rate (TFR), General Fertility
		Rate (GFR), and Age Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR)) using
		Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) women/individual data, and
		childhood mortality rates such as Neonatal Mortality Rate
		(NNMR), Post-neonatal Mortality Rate (PNNMR), Infant Mortality
		Rate (IMR), Child Mortality Rate (CMR), and Under-5 Mortality
		Rate (U5MR). In addition to the indicators, the 'DHS.rates'
		package estimates precision indicators such as Standard Error
		(SE), Design Effect (DEFT), Relative Standard Error (RSE) and
		Confidence Interval (CI). The package is developed according to
		the DHS methodology of calculating the fertility indicators and
		the childhood mortality rates  outlined in the "DHS Guide to
		Statistics" (Rutstein and Rojas 2006, http://dhsprogram.com/pub
		s/pdf/DHSG1/Guide_to_DHS_Statistics_29Oct2012_DHSG1.pdf) and
		the DHS methodology of estimating the precision indicators
		outlined in the "DHS Sampling and Household Listing Manual"
		(ICF International 2012, https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSM4/
		DHS6_Sampling_Manual_Sept2012_DHSM4.pdf).
