		Calculate Key DHS Indicators // Calculates key indicators such as
		fertility rates (Total Fertility Rate (TFR), General Fertility
		Rate (GFR), and Age Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR)) using
		Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) women/individual data. In
		addition to the indicators, the 'DHS.rates' package estimates
		precision indicators such as Standard Error (SE), Design Effect
		(DEFT), Relative Standard Error (RSE) and Confidence Interval
		(CI). The package is developed according to the DHS methodology
		of calculating the fertility indicators  outlined in the "DHS
		Guide to Statistics" (Rutstein and Rojas 2006, http://dhsprogra
		m.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG1/Guide_to_DHS_Statistics_29Oct2012_DHSG1.pd
		f) and the DHS methodology of estimating the precision
		indicators outlined in the "DHS Sampling and Household Listing
		Manual" (ICF International 2012, https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pd
		f/DHSM4/DHS6_Sampling_Manual_Sept2012_DHSM4.pdf).
