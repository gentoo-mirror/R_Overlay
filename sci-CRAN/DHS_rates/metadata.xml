		Calculates Demographic Indicators // Calculates key indicators
		such as fertility rates (Total Fertility Rate (TFR), General
		Fertility Rate (GFR), and Age Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR))
		using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) women/individual
		data, and childhood mortality rates such as Neonatal Mortality
		Rate (NNMR), Post-neonatal Mortality Rate (PNNMR), Infant
		Mortality Rate (IMR), Child Mortality Rate (CMR), and Under-
		five Mortality Rate (U5MR). In addition to the indicators, the
		'DHS.rates' package estimates sampling errors indicators such
		as Standard Error (SE), Design Effect (DEFT), Relative Standard
		Error (RSE) and Confidence Interval (CI). The package is
		developed according to the DHS methodology of calculating the
		fertility indicators and the childhood mortality rates
		outlined in the "Guide to DHS Statistics" (Croft, Trevor N.,
		Aileen M. J. Marshall, Courtney K. Allen, et al. 2018,
		https://dhsprogram.com/Data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/index.cfm)
		and the DHS methodology of estimating the sampling errors
		indicators outlined in the "DHS Sampling and Household Listing
		Manual" (ICF International 2012, https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pd
		f/DHSM4/DHS6_Sampling_Manual_Sept2012_DHSM4.pdf).
