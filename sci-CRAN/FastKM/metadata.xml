		A Fast Multiple-Kernel Method Based on a Low-Rank Approximation
		// A computationally efficient and statistically rigorous fast
		Kernel Machine method for multi-kernel analysis. The approach
		is based on a low-rank approximation to the nuisance effect
		kernel matrices. The algorithm is applicable to continuous,
		binary, and survival traits and is implemented using the
		existing single-kernel analysis software 'SKAT' and 'coxKM'.
		'coxKM' can be obtained from
		http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/xlin/software.html.
