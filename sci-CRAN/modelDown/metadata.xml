		Make Static HTML Website for Predictive Models // Website
		generator with HTML summaries for predictive models. This
		package uses 'DALEX' explainers to describe global model
		behavior. We can see how well models behave (tabs: Model
		Performance, Auditor), how much each variable contributes to
		predictions (tabs: Variable Response) and which variables are
		the most important for a given model (tabs: Variable
		Importance). We can also compare Concept Drift for pairs of
		models (tabs: Drifter). Additionally, data available on the
		website can be easily recreated in current R session. Work on
		this package was financially supported by the NCN Opus grant
		2017/27/B/ST6/01307 at Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty
		of Mathematics and Information Science.
