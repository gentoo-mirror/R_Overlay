		Generalised Survival Trial Assessment Tool Environment //
		Provides tools to assist planning and monitoring of time-to-
		event trials under complicated censoring assumptions and/or
		non-proportional hazards. There are three main components: The
		first is analytic calculation of predicted time-to-event trial
		properties, providing estimates of expected hazard ratio, event
		numbers and power under different analysis methods. The second
		is simulation, allowing stochastic estimation of these same
		properties. Thirdly, it provides parametric event prediction
		using blinded trial data, including creation of prediction
		intervals. Methods are based upon numerical integration and a
		flexible object-orientated structure for defining event,
		censoring and recruitment distributions (Curves).
