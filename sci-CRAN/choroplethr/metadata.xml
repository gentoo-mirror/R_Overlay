		Simplify the Creation of Choropleth Maps // Choropleths are
		thematic maps where geographic regions, such as states, are
		colored according to some metric, such as the number of people
		who live in that state. This package simplifies this process by
		1. Providing ready-made functions for creating choropleths of
		common maps. 2. Providing data and API connections to
		interesting data sources for making choropleths. 3. Providing a
		framework for creating choropleths from arbitrary shapefiles.
		4. Overlaying those maps over reference maps from 'Google
		Maps'.
