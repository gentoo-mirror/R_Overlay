		Create Color-Coded Choropleth Maps in R // Easily create color-
		coded (choropleth) maps in R. No knowledge of cartography or
		shapefiles needed; go directly from your geographically
		identified data to a highly customizable map with a single line
		of code! Supported geographies: U.S. states, counties, and
		census tracts, world countries and sub-country regions (e.g.,
		provinces, prefectures, etc.). One of the suggested packages,
		rnaturalearthhires, is not available on CRAN owing to its
		larger filesize (40MB). It can be installed from GitHub using r
		emotes::install_github("https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalear
		thhires"). This package contains higher resolution sub-country
		maps and is only needed for the choropleth_admin1() function.
