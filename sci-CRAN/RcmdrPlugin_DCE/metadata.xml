		R Commander Plug-in for Discrete Choice Experiments // Adds menu
		items for discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to the R
		Commander. DCE is a question-based survey method that designs
		various combinations (profiles) of attribute levels using the
		experimental designs, asks respondents to select the most
		preferred profile in each choice set, and then measures
		preferences for the attribute levels by analyzing the
		responses. For details on DCEs, refer to Louviere et al. (2000)
