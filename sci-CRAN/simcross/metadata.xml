		Simulate Experimental Crosses // Simulate and plot general
		experimental crosses. The focus is on simulating genotypes with
		an aim towards flexibility rather than speed. Meiosis is
		simulated following the Stahl model, in which chiasma locations
		are the superposition of two processes: a proportion p coming
		from a process exhibiting no interference, and the remainder
		coming from a process following the chi-square model.
