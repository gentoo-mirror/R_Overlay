		Selection of Training Populations by Genetic Algorithm //
		Combining Predictive Analytics and Experimental Design to
		Optimize Results. To be utilized to select a test data
		calibrated training population in high dimensional prediction
		problems and assumes that the explanatory variables are
		observed for all of the individuals. Once a "good" training set
		is identified, the response variable can be obtained only for
		this set to build a model for predicting the response in the
		test set. The algorithms in the package can be tweaked to solve
		some other subset selection problems.
