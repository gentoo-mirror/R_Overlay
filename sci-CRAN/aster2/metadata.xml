		Aster Models // Aster models are exponential family regression
		models for life history analysis.  They are like generalized
		linear models except that elements of the response vector can
		have different families (e. g., some Bernoulli, some Poisson,
		some zero-truncated Poisson, some normal) and can be dependent,
		the dependence indicated by a graphical structure. Discrete
		time survival analysis, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and
		generalized linear models that are exponential family (e. g.,
		logistic regression and Poisson regression with log link) are
		special cases. Main use is for data in which there is survival
		over discrete time periods and there is additional data about
		what happens conditional on survival (e. g., number of
		offspring).  Uses the exponential family canonical
		parameterization (aster transform of usual parameterization).
		Unlike the aster package, this package does dependence groups
		(nodes of the graph need not be conditionally independent given
		their predecessor node), including multinomial and two-
		parameter normal as families.  Thus this package also
		generalizes mark-capture-recapture analysis.
