		Binary Classification via GMDH-Type Neural Network Algorithm //
		Performs binary classification via Group Method of Data
		Handling (GMDH) - type neural network algorithm. Also, it
		produces a well-formatted table of descriptives for a binary
		response. Moreover, it returns confusion matrix and related
		statistics and scatter plot with classification labels of
		binary classes to assess the prediction performance. All
		'GMDH2' functions are designed for a binary response. See Dag
		O. and Yozgatligil C. (2016, ISSN:2073-4859) and Kondo T. and
		Ueno J. (2016, ISSN:1349-4198) for the details of GMDH
		algorithms.
