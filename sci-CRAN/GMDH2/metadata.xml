		Binary Classification via GMDH-Type Neural Network Algorithm //
		Performs binary classification via Group Method of Data
		Handling (GMDH) - type neural network algorithm. There exist
		two main algorithms available in GMDH() and dceGMDH()
		functions. GMDH() performs classification via GMDH algorithm
		for a binary response and returns important variables.
		dceGMDH() performs classification via diverse classifiers
		ensemble based on GMDH (dce-GMDH) algorithm. Also, the package
		produces a well-formatted table of descriptives for a binary
		response. Moreover, it produces confusion matrix and related
		statistics and scatter plot (2D and 3D) with classification
		labels of binary classes to assess the prediction performance.
		All 'GMDH2' functions are designed for a binary response. See
		Dag O. and Yozgatligil C. (2016, ISSN:2073-4859) and Kondo T.
		and Ueno J. (2016, ISSN:1349-4198) for the details of GMDH
		algorithms.
