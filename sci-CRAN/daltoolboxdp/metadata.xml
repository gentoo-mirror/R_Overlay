		Python-Based Extensions for Data Analytics Workflows // Provides
		Python-based extensions to enhance data analytics workflows,
		particularly for tasks involving data preprocessing and
		predictive modeling. Includes tools for data sampling,
		transformation, feature selection, balancing strategies (e.g.,
		SMOTE), and model construction. These capabilities leverage
		Python libraries via the reticulate interface, enabling
		seamless integration with a broader machine learning ecosystem.
		Supports instance selection and hybrid workflows that combine R
		and Python functionalities for flexible and reproducible
		analytical pipelines. The architecture is inspired by the
		Experiment Lines approach, which promotes modularity,
		extensibility, and interoperability across tools. More
		information on Experiment Lines is available in Ogasawara et
		al. (2009) doi:10.1007/978-3-642-02279-1_20.
