		Matrix-Variate Skew Linear Regression Models // An implementation
		of the alternating expectation conditional maximization (AECM)
		algorithm for matrix-variate variance gamma (MVVG) and normal-
		inverse Gaussian (MVNIG) linear models. These models are
		designed for settings of multivariate analysis with clustered
		non-uniform observations and correlated responses. The package
		includes fitting and prediction functions for both models, and
		an example dataset from a periodontal on Gullah-speaking
		African Americans, with responses in gaad_res, and covariates
		in gaad_cov. For more details on the matrix-variate
		distributions used, see Gallaugher  McNicholas (2019)
