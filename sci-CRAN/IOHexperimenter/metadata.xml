		Benchmarking Part of the 'IOHprofiler' // The benchmarking module
		for the Iterative Optimization Heuristics Profiler
		('IOHprofiler'). This module provides benchmarking in the
		'IOHprofiler' format. It enables performance tracking and
		analysis for any iterative optimization heuristic, which can be
		visualized and analyzed using the 'IOHanalyzer' package. It
		also provides access to predefined benchmarking functions, both
		for pseudo-boolean and continuous domains, as well as some
		sample algorithms.
