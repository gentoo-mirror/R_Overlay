		Anomaly Detection with Normal Probability Functions // Implements
		anomaly detection as binary classification for cross-sectional
		data. Uses maximum likelihood estimates and normal probability
		functions to classify observations as anomalous. The method is
		presented in the following lecture from the Machine Learning
		course by Andrew Ng: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-
		learning/lecture/C8IJp/algorithm/, and is also described in:
		Aleksandar Lazarevic, Levent Ertoz, Vipin Kumar, Aysel Ozgur,
		Jaideep Srivastava (2003) doi:10.1137/1.9781611972733.3.
