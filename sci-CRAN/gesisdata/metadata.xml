		Reproducible Data Retrieval from the GESIS Data Archive //
		Reproducible, programmatic retrieval of datasets from the GESIS
		Data Archive.  The GESIS Data Archive https://search.gesis.org
		makes available thousands of invaluable datasets, but
		researchers using these datasets are caught in a bind.  The
		archive's terms and conditions bar dissemination of downloaded
		datasets to third parties, but to ensure that one's work can be
		reproduced, assessed, and built upon by others, one must
		provide access to the raw data one has employed.  The
		'gesisdata' package cuts this knot by providing registered
		users with programmatic, reproducible access to GESIS datasets
		from within 'R'.
