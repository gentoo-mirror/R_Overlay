		Adsorption Isotherm Models // Model adsorption behavior using
		classical isotherms, including Langmuir, Freundlich,
		BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET), and Temkin models. The package
		supports parameter estimation through both linearized and non-
		linear fitting techniques and generates high-quality plots for
		model diagnostics. It is intended for environmental scientists,
		chemists, and researchers working on adsorption phenomena in
		soils, water treatment, and material sciences. Functions are
		compatible with base 'R' and 'ggplot2' for visualization.
