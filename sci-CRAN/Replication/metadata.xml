		Test Replications by Means of the Prior Predictive p-Value //
		Allows for the computation of a prior predictive p-value to
		test replication of relevant features of original studies.
		Relevant features are captured in informative hypotheses. The
		package also allows for the computation of power. The
		statistical underpinnings are described in Zondervan-
		Zwijnenburg (2019) doi:10.31234/osf.io/uvh5s.
