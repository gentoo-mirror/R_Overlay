		Analysis of Incubation Data // Suite of functions to study animal
		incubation. At the core of incR lies an algorithm that allows
		for the scoring of incubation behaviour. Additionally, several
		functions extract biologically relevant metrics of incubation
		such as off-bout number and off-bout duration - for a review of
		avian incubation studies, see Nests, Eggs, and Incubation: New
