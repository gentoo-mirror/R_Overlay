		Graded Matching for Large Observational Studies // R-best
		matching is a new graded matching strategy in which potential
		pairings are graded, with a preference for higher grade
		pairings. An r-best match tries to match with pairs of the best
		grade, incorporating progressively lower grade pairs only to
		the degree they are needed, and only needs to use edges in the
		r best grades. In effect, only sparse networks are built,
		stored and optimized.
