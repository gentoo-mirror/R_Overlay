		Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping // Provides several functions to create
		and manipulate fuzzy cognitive maps. It is based on 'FCMapper'
		for Excel, distributed at http:// www.fcmappers.net/joomla/,
		developed by Michael Bachhofer and Martin Wildenberg. Maps are
		inputted as adjacency matrices. Attributes of the maps and the
		equilibrium values of the concepts (including with user-defined
		constrained values) can be calculated. The maps can be graphed
		with a function that calls 'igraph'. Multiple maps with shared
		concepts can be aggregated.
