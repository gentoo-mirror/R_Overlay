		Group Sequential Refined Secondary Boundary // A gate-keeping
		procedure to test a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group
		sequential design with multiple interim looks. Computations
		related to group sequential primary and secondary boundaries.
		Refined secondary boundaries are calculated for a gate-keeping
		test on a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group
		sequential design with multiple interim looks. The choices
		include both the standard boundaries and the boundaries using
		error spending functions. See Tamhane et al. (2018), "A
		gatekeeping procedure to test a primary and a secondary
		endpoint in a group sequential design with multiple interim
		looks", Biometrics, 74(1), 40-48.
