		Diagnostics for Confounding of Time-Varying and Other Joint
		Exposures // Implements three covariate-balance diagnostics for
		time-varying confounding and selection-bias in complex
		longitudinal data, as described in Jackson (2016)
		doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000547 and Jackson (2019)
		doi:10.1093/aje/kwz136. Diagnostic 1 assesses measured
		confounding/selection-bias, diagnostic 2 assesses exposure-
		covariate feedback, and diagnostic 3 assesses residual
		confounding/selection-bias after inverse probability weighting
		or propensity score stratification. All diagnostics
		appropriately account for exposure history, can be adapted to
		assess a particular depth of covariate history, and can be
		implemented in right-censored data. Balance assessments can be
		obtained for all times, selected-times, or averaged across
		person-time. The balance measures are reported as tables or
		plots. These diagnostics can be applied to the study of
		multivariate exposures including time-varying exposures, direct
		effects, interaction, and censoring.
