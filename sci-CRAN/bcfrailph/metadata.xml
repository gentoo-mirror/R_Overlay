		Semiparametric Bivariate Correlated Frailty Model // Fit and
		simulate a semiparametric bivariate correlated frailty models
		with proportional hazard structure. Frailty distributions, such
		as gamma and lognormal models are supported. Bivariate gamma
		fit is obtained using the approach given in Iachine (1995) and
		lognormal fit is based on the approach by Ripatti and Palmgren
