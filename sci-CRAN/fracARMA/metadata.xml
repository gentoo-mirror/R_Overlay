		Fractionally Integrated ARMA Model // Implements fractional
		differencing with Autoregressive Moving Average models to
		analyse long-memory       time series data. Traditional ARIMA
		models typically use integer values for differencing, which are
		suitable for time series with short memory or anti-persistent
		behaviour. In contrast, the Fractional ARIMA      model allows
		fractional differencing, enabling it to effectively capture
		long memory characteristics in         time series data. The
		fracARMA package is user-friendly and allows users to manually
		input the  fractional differencing parameter, which can be
		obtained using various estimators such as the GPH
		estimator, Sperio method, or Wavelet method and many.
		Additionally, the package enables users to directly       feed
		the time series data, AR order, MA order, fractional
		differencing parameter, and the proportion of         training
		data as a split ratio, all in a single command. The package is
		based on the reference from the         paper of Irshad and
		others (2024, doi:10.22271/maths.2024.v9.i6b.1906).
