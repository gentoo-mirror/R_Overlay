		Ensembling Regularized Linear Models // Functions for computing
		the ensembles of regularized linear regression estimators
		defined in Christidis, Lakshmanan, Smucler and Zamar (2017)
		arXiv:1712.03561. The procedure works on top of a given
		penalized linear regression estimator, the Elastic Net in this
		implementation, by fitting it to possibly overlapping subsets
		of features, while at the same time encouraging diversity among
		the subsets, to reduce the correlations between the predictions
		that result from each fitted model. The predictions from the
		models are then aggregated.
