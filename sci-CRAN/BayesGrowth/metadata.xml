		Estimate Fish Growth Using MCMC Analysis // Estimate fish length-
		at-age models using MCMC analysis with 'rstan' models. This
		package allows a multimodel approach to growth fitting to be
		applied to length-at-age data and is supported by further
		analyses to determine model selection and result presentation.
		The core methods of this package are presented in Smart and
		Grammer (2021) "Modernising fish and shark growth curves with
		Bayesian length-at-age models". PLOS ONE 16(2): e0246734
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0246734.
