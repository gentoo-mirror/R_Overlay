		Virome Sequencing Analysis Result Browser // Experiments in which
		highly complex virome sequencing data is generated are
		difficult to visualize and unpack for a person without
		programming experience. After processing of the raw sequencing
		data by a next generation sequencing (NGS) processing pipeline
		the usual output consists of contiguous sequences (contigs) in
		fasta format and an annotation file linking the contigs to a
		reference sequence. The virome analysis browser app imports an
		annotation file and a corresponding fasta file containing the
		annotated contigs. It facilitates browsing of annotations in
		multiple files and allows users to select and export specific
		annotated sequences from the associated fasta files. Various
		annotation quality thresholds can be set to filter contigs from
		the annotation files. Further inspection of selected contigs
		can be done in the form of automatic open reading frame (ORF)
		detection. Separate contigs and/or separate ORFs can be
		downloaded in nucleotide or amino acid format for further
		analysis.
