		Relational Data Modeler // The aim of this package is to
		manipulate relational data models in R. It provides functions
		to create, modify and export data models in json format. It
		also allows importing models created with 'MySQL Workbench'
		(https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). These functions
		are accessible through a graphical user interface made with
		'shiny'. Constraints such as types, keys, uniqueness and
		mandatory fields are automatically checked and corrected when
		editing a model. Finally, real data can be confronted to a
		model to check their compatibility.
