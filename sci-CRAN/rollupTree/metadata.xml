		Perform Recursive Computations // Mass rollup for a Bill of
		Materials is an example of a class of computations in which
		elements are arranged in a tree structure and some property of
		each element is a computed function of the corresponding values
		of its child elements. Leaf elements, i.e., those with no
		children, have values assigned. In many cases, the combining
		function is simple arithmetic sum; in other cases (e.g., mass
		properties), the combiner may involve other information such as
		the geometric relationship between parent and child, or
		statistical relations such as root-sum-of-squares (RSS). This
		package implements a general function for such problems. It is
		adapted to specific recursive computations by functional
		programming techniques; the caller passes a function as the
		update parameter to rollup() (or, at a lower level, passes
		functions as the get, set, combine, and override parameters to
		update_prop()) at runtime to specify the desired operations.
		The implementation relies on graph-theoretic algorithms from
		the 'igraph' package of Csrdi, et al. (2006
		doi:10.5281/zenodo.7682609).
