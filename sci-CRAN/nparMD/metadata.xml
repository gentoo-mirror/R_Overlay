		Nonparametric Analysis of Multivariate Data in Factorial Designs
		// Analysis of multivariate data with two-way completely
		randomized factorial design. The analysis is based on fully
		nonparametric, rank-based methods and uses test statistics
		based on the Dempster's ANOVA, Wilk's Lambda, Lawley-Hotelling
		and Bartlett-Nanda-Pillai criteria. The multivariate response
		is allowed to be ordinal, quantitative, binary or a mixture of
		the different variable types. The package offers two functions
		performing the analysis, one for small and the other for large
		sample sizes. The underlying methodology is largely described
		in Bathke and Harrar (2016) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-39065-9_7 and
		in Munzel and Brunner (2000) doi:10.1016/S0378-3758(99)00212-8.
