		Spatial Analysis in Archaeology from Refitting Fragments //
		Methods to analyse spatial units in archaeology from the
		relationships between refitting fragmented objects scattered in
		these units (e.g. stratigraphic layers). Graphs are used to
		model archaeological observations. The package is mainly based
		on the 'igraph' package for graph analysis. Functions can: 1)
		create, manipulate, and simulate fragmentation graphs, 2)
		measure the cohesion and admixture of archaeological spatial
		units, and 3) characterise the topology of a specific set of
		refitting relationships. Empirical datasets are provided as
		examples. Documentation about 'archeofrag' is provided by the
		vignette included in this package, by the accompanying
		scientific papers: Plutniak (2021, Journal of Archaeological
		Science, doi:10.1016/j.jas.2021.105501) and Plutniak (2022,
		Journal of Open Source Software, doi:10.21105/joss.04335). This
		package is complemented by a companion GUI application
		available at https://analytics.huma-
		num.fr/Sebastien.Plutniak/archeofrag/.
