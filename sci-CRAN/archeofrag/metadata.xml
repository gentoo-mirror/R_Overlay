		Refitting and Stratigraphic Analysis in Archeology // Methods for
		the stratigraphic analysis of fragmented objects in archeology
		using "refitting" relationships between fragments scattered in
		stratigraphic layers. Graphs and graph theory are used to model
		archaeological observations. The package is mainly based on the
		'igraph' package for graph analysis. Functions enable to 1)
		create, manipulate, and simulate fragmentation graphs, 2)
		measure the cohesion and admixture of stratigraphic layers, and
		3) characterise the topology of a specific set of refitting
		relationships. An empirical dataset is also provided as an
		example.
