		Refitting and Spatial Analysis in Archaeology // Methods to
		analyse fragmented objects in archaeology using refitting
		relationships between fragments scattered in archaeological
		spatial units (e.g. stratigraphic layers). Graphs and graph
		theory are used to model archaeological observations. The
		package is mainly based on the 'igraph' package for graph
		analysis. Functions can: 1) create, manipulate, and simulate
		fragmentation graphs, 2) measure the cohesion and admixture of
		archaeological spatial units, and 3) characterise the topology
		of a specific set of refitting relationships. An empirical
		dataset is also provided as an example. Documentation about
		'archeofrag' is provided by the vignette included in this
		package and by the accompanying scientific papers: Plutniak
		(2021, Journal of Archaeological Science,
		doi:10.1016/j.jas.2021.105501) and Plutniak (2022, Journal of
		Open Source Software, doi:10.21105/joss.04335).
