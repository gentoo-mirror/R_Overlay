		Partially Balanced Incomplete Block Designs // The PBIB designs
		are important type of incomplete block designs having wide area
		of their applications for example in agricultural experiments,
		in plant breeding, in sample surveys etc. This package
		constructs various series of PBIB designs and assists in
		checking all the necessary conditions of PBIB designs and the
		association scheme on which these designs are based on. It also
		assists in calculating the efficiencies of PBIB designs with
		any number of associate classes. The package also constructs
		Youden-m square designs which are Row-Column designs for the
		two-way elimination of heterogeneity. The incomplete columns of
		these Youden-m square designs constitute PBIB designs. With the
		present functionality, the package will be of immense
		importance for the researchers as it will help them to
		construct PBIB designs, to check if their PBIB designs and
		association scheme satisfy various necessary conditions for the
		existence, to calculate the efficiencies of PBIB designs based
		on any association scheme and to construct Youden-m square
		designs for the two-way elimination of heterogeneity. R. C.
		Bose and K. R. Nair (1939)
