		Life History Analysis Tools // Estimate aquatic species life
		history using robust techniques. This package supports users
		undertaking two types of analysis: 1) Growth from length-at-age
		data, and 2) maturity analyses for length and/or age data.
		Maturity analyses are performed using generalised linear model
		approaches incorporating either a binomial or quasibinomial
		distribution. Growth modelling is performed using the
		multimodel approach presented by Smart et al. (2016)
		"Multimodel approaches in shark and ray growth studies:
		strengths, weaknesses and the future" doi:10.1111/faf.12154.
