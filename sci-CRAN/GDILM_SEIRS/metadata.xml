		Spatial Modeling of Infectious Disease with Reinfection //
		Geographically Dependent Individual Level Models (GDILMs)
		within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible
		(SEIRS) framework are applied to model infectious disease
		transmission, incorporating reinfection dynamics. This package
		employs a likelihood based Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional
		Maximization (MCECM) algorithm for estimating model parameters.
		It also provides tools for GDILM fitting, parameter estimation,
		AIC calculation on real pandemic data, and simulation studies
		customized to user-defined model settings.
