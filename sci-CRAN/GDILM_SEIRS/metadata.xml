		Spatial Individual Level Modeling of Infectious Disease
		Transmission with Reinfection Dynamics // Geographically
		Dependent Individual Level Models (GDILMs) within the
		Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS)
		framework are applied to model infectious disease transmission,
		incorporating reinfection dynamics. This package employs a
		likelihood based Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional
		Maximization (MCECM) algorithm for estimating model parameters.
		It also provides tools for GDILM fitting, parameter estimation,
		AIC calculation on real pandemic data, and simulation studies
		customized to user-defined model settings.
