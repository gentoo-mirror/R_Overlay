		Reproducibility for Interval-Censored Data // Calculates
		intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessing
		reproducibility of interval-censored data with two repeated
		measurements (Kovacic and Varnai (2014)
		doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000139). ICC is estimated by maximum
		likelihood from model with one fixed and one random effect
		(both intercepts). Help in model checking (normality of
		subjects' means and residuals) is provided.
