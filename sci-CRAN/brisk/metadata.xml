		Bayesian Benefit Risk Analysis // Quantitative methods for
		benefit-risk analysis help to condense complex decisions into a
		univariate metric describing the overall benefit relative to
		risk.  One approach is to use the multi-criteria decision
		analysis framework (MCDA), as in Mussen, Salek, and Walker
		(2007) doi:10.1002/pds.1435.  Bayesian benefit-risk analysis
		incorporates uncertainty through posterior distributions which
		are inputs to the benefit-risk framework.  The brisk package
		provides functions to assist with Bayesian benefit-risk
		analyses, such as MCDA. Users input posterior samples, utility
		functions, weights, and the package outputs quantitative
		benefit-risk scores.  The posterior of the benefit-risk scores
		for each group can be compared.  Some plotting capabilities are
		also included.
