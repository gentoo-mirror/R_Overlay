		Formatting Tools for 'rmarkdown' Documents // Provides a small
		set of tools for formatting tasks when creating documents in R
		Markdown or Quarto Markdown. Convert the elements of a
		numerical vector to character strings in one of several forms:
		powers-of-ten notation in engineering or scientific form
		delimited for rendering as inline equations; integer or decimal
		notation delimited for equation rendering; numbers with
		measurement units (non-delimited) where units are selected to
		eliminate the need for powers-of-ten or scientific notation.
		Useful for rendering a numerical scalar in an inline R code
		chunk as well as formatting columns of data frames displayed in
		a table.
