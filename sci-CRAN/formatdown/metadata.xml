		Formatting Numbers in 'rmarkdown' Documents // Provides a small
		set of tools for formatting numbers in R-markdown documents.
		Convert a numerical vector to character strings in power-of-ten
		form, decimal form, or measurement-units form; all are math-
		delimited for rendering as inline equations. Can also convert
		text into math-delimited text to match the font face and size
		of math-delimited numbers. Useful for rendering single numbers
		in inline R code chunks and for rendering columns in tables.
