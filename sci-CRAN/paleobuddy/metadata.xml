		Simulating Diversification Dynamics // Simulation of species
		diversification, fossil records, and phylogenies. While the
		literature on species birth-death simulators is extensive,
		including important software like 'paleotree' and 'APE', we
		concluded there were interesting gaps to be filled regarding
		possible diversification scenarios. Here we strove for
		flexibility over focus, implementing a large array of regimens
		for users to experiment with and combine. In this way,
		'paleobuddy' can be used in complement to other simulators as a
		flexible jack of all trades, or, in the case of scenarios
		implemented only here, can allow for robust and easy
		simulations for novel situations. Environmental data modified
		from that in 'RPANDA': Morlon H. et al (2016)
