		Integral Transformation Methods for SDR in Regression // The
		routine, itdr(), which allows to estimate the sufficient
		dimension reduction subspaces, i.e., central mean subspace or
		central subspace in regression, using Fourier transformation
		proposed by Zhu and Zeng (2006)
		https:doi.org/10.1198/016214506000000140, convolution
		transformation proposed by  Zeng and Zhu (2010)
		https:doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2009.08.004 and iterative Hessian
		transformation methods proposed by Cook and Li (2002)
		https:doi.org/10.1214/aos/1021379861. The predictor variables
		can be consider to have a multivariate normal distribution or
		an elliptical contoured distribution. If the distribution of
		the predictor variables is unknown, then the predictors'
		distribution can be estimated by the kernel density estimation
		method. Moreover, each of these routines is supported with a
		bootstrap procedure to estimate their tuning parameters. That
		is, wx() estimates the tuning parameter for the predictor
		variables, wy() estimates the tuning parameter for the response
		variable, and wh() estimates the bandwidth parameter for the
		kernel density estimation method. The function invFM()
		estimates the central subspace using Fourier transform approach
		for inverse dimension reduction method proposed by Weng and Yin
		(2018) https:doi.org/10.1080/10485252.2018.1515432. The
		function d.test() estimates the dimension of the central mean
		subspace using hypothesis under invFM(). Moreover, the dsp()
		function provides the two distance measures between two
		subspaces spanned by the columns of two matrices; Vector
		correlation proposed by Hooper (1959)
		https:doi.org/10.2307/1909445, and Trace correlation proposed
		by Hotelling (1936) https:doi.org/10.2307/2333955.
