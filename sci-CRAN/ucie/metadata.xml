		Mapping 3D Data into CIELab Color Space // Returns a data frame
		with the names of the input data points and hex colors (or
		CIELab coordinates). Data can be mapped to colors for use in
		data visualization. It optimally maps data points into a
		polygon that represents the CIELab colour space. Since
		Euclidean distance approximates relative perceptual differences
		in CIELab color space, the result is a color encoding that aims
		to capture much of the structure of the original data.
