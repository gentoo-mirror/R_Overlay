		Transition Network Analysis (TNA) // Provides tools for
		performing Transition Network Analysis (TNA) to study
		relational dynamics, including functions for building and
		plotting TNA models, calculating centrality measures, and
		identifying dominant events and patterns. TNA statistical
		techniques (e.g., bootstrapping and permutation tests) ensure
		the reliability of observed insights and confirm that
		identified dynamics are meaningful. See (Saqr et al., 2025)
		doi:10.1145/3706468.3706513 for more details on TNA.
