		Fit the Regularized Gehan Estimator with Elastic Net and Sparse
		Group Lasso Penalties // The semiparametric accelerated failure
		time (AFT) model is an attractive alternative to the Cox
		proportional hazards model. This package provides a suite of
		functions for fitting one popular estimator of the
		semiparametric AFT model, the regularized Gehan estimator.
		Specifically, we provide functions for cross-validation,
		prediction, coefficient extraction, and visualizing both trace
		plots and cross-validation curves. For further details, please
		see Suder, P. M. and Molstad, A. J., (2022+) Scalable
		algorithms for semiparametric accelerated failure time models
		in high dimensions, to appear in Statistics in Medicine
