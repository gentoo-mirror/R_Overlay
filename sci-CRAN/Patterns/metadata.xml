		Deciphering Biological Networks with Patterned Heterogeneous
		Measurements // A modeling tool dedicated to biological network
		modeling. It allows for single or joint modeling of, for
		instance, genes and proteins. It starts with the selection of
		the actors that will be the used in the reverse engineering
		upcoming step. An actor can be included in that selection based
		on its differential measurement (for instance gene expression
		or protein abundance) or on its time course profile. Wrappers
		for actors clustering functions and cluster analysis are
		provided. It also allows reverse engineering of biological
		networks taking into account the observed time course patterns
		of the actors. Many inference functions are provided and
		dedicated to get specific features for the inferred network
		such as sparsity, robust links, high confidence links or stable
		through resampling links. Some simulation and prediction tools
		are also available for cascade networks. Example of use with
		microarray or RNA-Seq data are provided.
