		Tools for 2D and 3D Plots of Single and Multi-Objective
		Linear/Integer Programming Models // Make 2D and 3D plots of
		linear programming (LP), integer linear programming (ILP), or
		mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models with up to three
		objectives. Plots of both the solution and criterion space are
		possible. For instance the non-dominated (Pareto) set for bi-
		objective LP/ILP/MILP programming models (see vignettes for an
		overview).
