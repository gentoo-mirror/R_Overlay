		Unsupervised Gold-Standard Label Free Phenotyping Algorithm for
		EHR Data // The algorithm combines the most predictive
		variable, such as count of the main International
		Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and other Electronic
		Health Record (EHR) features (e.g. health utilization and
		processed clinical note data), to obtain a score for accurate
		risk prediction and disease classification. In particular, it
		normalizes the surrogate to resemble gaussian mixture and
		leverages the remaining features through random corruption
		denoising. Background and details about the method can be found
		at Yu et al. (2018) doi:10.1093/jamia/ocx111.
