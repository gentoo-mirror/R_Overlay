		Computation of Optimal Transport Plans and Wasserstein Distances
		// Solve optimal transport problems. Compute Wasserstein
		distances (a.k.a. Kantorovitch, Fortet--Mourier, Mallows, Earth
		Mover's, or minimal L_p distances), return the corresponding
		transference plans, and display them graphically. Objects that
		can be compared include grey-scale images, (weighted) point
		patterns, and mass vectors.
