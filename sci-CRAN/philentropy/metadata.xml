		Similarity and Distance Quantification Between Probability
		Functions // Computes 46 optimized distance and similarity
		measures for comparing probability functions. These comparisons
		between probability functions have their foundations in a broad
		range of scientific disciplines from mathematics to ecology.
		The aim of this package is to provide a base framework for
		clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-
		fit, non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine
		learning tasks that are based on comparing univariate or
		multivariate probability functions.
