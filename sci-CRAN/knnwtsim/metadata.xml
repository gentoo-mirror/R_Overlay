		K Nearest Neighbor Forecasting with a Tailored Similarity Metric
		// Functions to implement K Nearest Neighbor forecasting using
		a weighted similarity metric tailored to the problem of
		forecasting univariate time series where recent observations,
		seasonal patterns, and exogenous predictors are all relevant in
		predicting future observations of the series in question. For
		more information on the formulation of this similarity metric
		please see Trupiano (2021)
