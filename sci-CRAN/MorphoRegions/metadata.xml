		Analysis of Regionalization Patterns in Serially Homologous
		Structures // Computes the optimal number of regions (or
		subdivisions) and their position in serial structures without a
		priori assumptions and to visualize the results. After reducing
		data dimensionality with the built-in function for data
		ordination, regions are fitted as segmented linear regressions
		along the serial structure. Every region boundary position and
		increasing number of regions are iteratively fitted and the
		best model (number of regions and boundary positions) is
		selected with an information criterion. This package expands on
		the previous 'regions' package (Jones et al., Science 2018)
		with improved computation and more fitting and plotting
		options.
