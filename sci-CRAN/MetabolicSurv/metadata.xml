		A Biomarker Validation Approach for Classification and Predicting
		Survival Using Metabolomics Signature // An approach to
		identifies metabolic biomarker signature for metabolic data by
		discovering predictive metabolite for predicting survival and
		classifying patients into risk groups. Classifiers are
		constructed as a linear combination of predictive/important
		metabolites, prognostic factors and treatment effects if
		necessary. Several methods were implemented to reduce the
		metabolomics matrix such as the  principle component analysis
		of Wold Svante et al. (1987) doi:10.1016/0169-7439(87)80084-9 ,
		the LASSO method by Robert Tibshirani (1998)
		doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19970228)16:4%3C385::AID-
		SIM380%3E3.0.CO;2-3, the elastic net approach by Hui Zou and
		Trevor Hastie (2005) doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x.
		Sensitivity analysis on the quantile used for the
		classification can also be accessed to check the deviation of
		the classification group based on the quantile specified. Large
		scale cross validation can be performed in  order to
		investigate the mostly selected predictive metabolites and for
		internal validation. During the evaluation process, validation
		is accessed using the hazard ratios (HR) distribution of the
		test set and inference is mainly based on resampling and
		permutations technique.
