		eBird Data Extraction and Processing in R // Extract and process
		bird sightings records from eBird (http://ebird.org), an online
		tool for recording bird observations.  Public access to the
		full eBird database is via the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD; see
		http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download for access), a
		downloadable text file. This package is an interface to AWK for
		extracting data from the EBD based on taxonomic, spatial, or
		temporal filters, to produce a manageable file size that can be
		imported into R.
