		Water and Measurements Quality // The functions proposed in this
		package allows to evaluate the process of measurement of the
		chemical components of water numerically or graphically.
		TSSS(), ICHS and datacheck() functions are useful to control
		the quality of measurements of chemical components of a sample
		of water. If one or more measurements include an error, the
		generated graph will indicate it with a position of the point
		that represents the sample outside the confidence interval. The
		function CI() allows to evaluate the possibility of
		contamination of a water sample after being obtained.
		Validation() is a function that allows to calculate the quality
		parameters of a technique for the measurement of a chemical
		component.
