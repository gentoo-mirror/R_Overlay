		Water and Measurements Quality // The functions proposed in this
		package allows to graphically evaluate the process of
		measurement of the chemical components of water. TSSS() and
		ICHS functions are useful to control the quality of
		measurements of chemical components of a sample of water. If
		one or more measurements include an error, the generated graph
		will indicate it with a position of the point that represents
		the sample outside the confidence interval.
