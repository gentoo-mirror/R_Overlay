		Optimal Row-Column Designs for Two-Colour cDNA Microarray
		Experiments // Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-
		optimal row-column designs for two-colour cDNA microarray
		experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed effects
		models where the interest is in a comparison of all pairwise
		treatment contrasts. The algorithms used in this package are
		based on the array exchange and treatment exchange algorithms
		adopted from Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2016, unpublished)
		algorithms after adjusting for the row-column designs setup.
		The package also provides an optional method of using the
		graphical user interface (GUI) R package tcltk to ensure that
		it is user friendly.
