		Assess Medication Adherence from Pharmaceutical Claims Data // A
		(mildly) opinionated set of functions to help assess medication
		adherence for researchers working with medication claims data.
		Medication adherence analyses have several complex steps that
		are often convoluted and can be time-intensive. The focus is to
		create a set of functions using "tidy principles" geared
		towards transparency, speed, and flexibility while working with
		adherence metrics. All functions perform exactly one task with
		an intuitive name so that a researcher can handle details
		(often achieved with vectorized solutions) while we handle non-
		vectorized tasks common to most adherence calculations such as
		adjusting fill dates and determining episodes of care. The
		methodologies in referenced in this package come from Canfield
		SL, et al (2019) "Navigating the Wild West of Medication
		Adherence Reporting in Specialty Pharmacy"
