		Adjusted Limited Dependent Variable Mixture Models // The goal of
		the package 'aldvmm' is to fit adjusted limited dependent
		variable mixture models of health state utilities. Adjusted
		limited dependent variable mixture models are finite mixtures
		of normal distributions with an accumulation of density mass at
		the limits, and a gap between 100% quality of life and the next
		smaller utility value. The package 'aldvmm' uses the likelihood
		and expected value functions proposed by Hernandez Alava and
		Wailoo (2015) doi:10.1177/1536867X1501500307 using normal
		component distributions and a multinomial logit model of
		probabilities of component membership.
