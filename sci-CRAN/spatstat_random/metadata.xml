		Random Generation Functionality for the 'spatstat' Family //
		Functionality for random generation of spatial data in the
		'spatstat' family of packages. Generates random spatial
		patterns of points according to many simple rules (complete
		spatial randomness, Poisson, binomial, random grid, systematic,
		cell), randomised alteration of patterns (thinning, random
		shift, jittering),  simulated realisations of random point
		processes including simple sequential inhibition, Matern
		inhibition models, Neyman-Scott cluster processes (using
		direct, Brix-Kendall, or hybrid algorithms), log-Gaussian Cox
		processes, product shot noise cluster processes and Gibbs point
		processes (using Metropolis-Hastings birth-death-shift
		algorithm, alternating Gibbs sampler, or coupling-from-the-past
		perfect simulation). Also generates random spatial patterns of
		line segments, random tessellations, and random images (random
		noise, random mosaics). Excludes random generation on a linear
		network, which is covered by the separate package
		'spatstat.linnet'.
