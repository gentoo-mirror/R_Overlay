		Random Generation Functionality for the 'spatstat' Family //
		Functionality for random generation of spatial data in the
		'spatstat' family of packages. Generates random spatial
		patterns of points according to many simple rules (complete
		spatial randomness, Poisson, binomial, random grid, systematic,
		cell), randomised alteration of patterns (thinning, random
		shift, jittering),  simulated realisations of random point
		processes (simple sequential inhibition, Matern inhibition
		models, Matern cluster process, Neyman-Scott cluster processes,
		log-Gaussian Cox processes, product shot noise cluster
		processes) and simulation of Gibbs point processes (Metropolis-
		Hastings birth-death-shift algorithm, alternating Gibbs
		sampler). Also generates random spatial patterns of line
		segments, random tessellations, and random images (random
		noise, random mosaics). Excludes random generation on a linear
		network, which is covered by the separate package
		'spatstat.linnet'.
