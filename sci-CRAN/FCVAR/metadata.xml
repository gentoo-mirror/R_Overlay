		Estimation and Inference for the Fractionally Cointegrated VAR //
		Estimation and inference using the Fractionally Cointegrated
		Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. It includes functions for
		model specification, including lag selection and cointegration
		rank selection, as well as a comprehensive set of options for
		hypothesis testing, including tests of hypotheses on the
		cointegrating relations, the adjustment coefficients and the
		fractional differencing parameters. An article describing the
		FCVAR model with examples is available on the Webpage
		https://sites.google.com/view/mortennielsen/software.
