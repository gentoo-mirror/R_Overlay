		Linear Networks Functionality of the 'spatstat' Family // Defines
		types of spatial data on a linear network and provides
		functionality for geometrical operations, data analysis and
		modelling of data on a linear network, in the 'spatstat' family
		of packages. Contains definitions and support for linear
		networks, including creation of networks, geometrical
		measurements, topological connectivity, geometrical operations
		such as inserting and deleting vertices, intersecting a network
		with another object, and interactive editing of networks. Data
		types defined on a network include point patterns, pixel
		images, functions, and tessellations. Exploratory methods
		include kernel estimation of intensity on a network,
		K-functions and pair correlation functions on a network,
		simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty
		space distance, relative risk estimation with cross-validated
		bandwidth selection. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern
		(chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-
		Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for
		covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported. Parametric models can be
		fitted to point pattern data using the function lppm() similar
		to glm(). Only Poisson models are implemented so far. Models
		may involve dependence on covariates and dependence on marks.
		Models are fitted by maximum likelihood. Fitted point process
		models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests
		of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test,
		analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools
		for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection
		(sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation
		envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage
		and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added
		variable plots. Random point patterns on a network can be
		generated using a variety of models.
