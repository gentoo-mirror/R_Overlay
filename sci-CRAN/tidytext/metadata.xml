		Text Mining using 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and Other Tidy Tools //
		Using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks
		easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in
		wide use. Much of the infrastructure needed for text mining
		with tidy data frames already exists in packages like 'dplyr',
		'broom', 'tidyr', and 'ggplot2'. In this package, we provide
		functions and supporting data sets to allow conversion of text
		to and from tidy formats, and to switch seamlessly between tidy
		tools and existing text mining packages.
