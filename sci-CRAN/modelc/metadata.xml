		A Linear Model to 'SQL' Compiler // This is a cross-platform
		linear model to 'SQL' compiler. It generates 'SQL' from linear
		and generalized linear models. Its interface consists of a
		single function, modelc(), which takes the output of lm() or
		glm() functions (or any object which has the same signature)
		and outputs a 'SQL' character vector representing the
		predictions on the scale of the response variable as described
		in Dunn  Smith (2018) doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-0118-7 and
		originating in Nelder  Wedderburn (1972) doi:10.2307/2344614.
		The resultant 'SQL' can be included in a 'SELECT' statement and
		returns output similar to that of the glm.predict() or
		lm.predict() predictions, assuming numeric types are
		represented in the database using sufficient precision.
		Currently log and identity link functions are supported.
