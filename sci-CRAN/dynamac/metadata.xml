		Dynamic Simulation and Testing for Single-Equation ARDL Models //
		While autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models allow for
		extremely flexible dynamics, interpreting substantive
		significance of complex lag structures remains difficult. This
		package is designed to assist users in dynamically simulating
		and plotting the results of various ARDL models. It also
		contains post-estimation diagnostics, including a test for
		cointegration when estimating the error-correction variant of
		the autoregressive distributed lag model (Pesaran, Shin, and
		Smith 2001 doi:10.1002/jae.616).
