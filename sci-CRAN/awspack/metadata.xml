		Amazon Web Services Bundle Package // A bundle of all of
		'cloudyr' project http://cloudyr.github.io/ packages for Amazon
		Web Services ('AWS') https://aws.amazon.com/. It depends upon
		all of the 'cloudyr' project's 'AWS' packages. It is mainly
		useful for installing the entire suite of packages; more likely
		than not you will only want to load individual packages one at
		a time.
