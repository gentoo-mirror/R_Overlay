		Calibration, Validation, and Simulation of TKTD Models // Eases
		the use of ecotoxicological effect models. Can simulate common
		toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK/TD) models such as General
		Unified Threshold models of Survival (GUTS) and Lemna. It can
		derive effects and effect profiles (EPx) from scenarios. It
		supports the use of 'tidyr' workflows employing the pipe
		symbol. Time-consuming tasks can be parallelized.
