		Truncated Rank Correlation // A new measure of similarity between
		a pair of mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, called truncated
		rank correlation (TRC). To provide a robust metric of
		similarity in noisy high-dimensional data, TRC uses truncated
		top ranks (or top m-ranks) for calculating correlation.
		Truncated rank correlation as a robust measure of test-retest
		reliability in mass spectrometry data. For more details see Lim
		et al. (2019) doi:10.1515/sagmb-2018-0056.
