		Paired Mass Distance Analysis for GC/LC-MS Based Non-Targeted
		Analysis and Reactomics Analysis // Paired mass distance (PMD)
		analysis proposed in Yu, Olkowicz and Pawliszyn (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.aca.2018.10.062 for gas/liquid chromatographymass
		spectrometry (GC/LC-MS) based non-targeted analysis. PMD
		analysis including GlobalStd algorithm and structure/reaction
		directed analysis. GlobalStd algorithm could found independent
		peaks in m/z-retention time profiles based on retention time
		hierarchical cluster analysis and frequency analysis of paired
		mass distances within retention time groups. Structure directed
		analysis could be used to find potential relationship among
		those independent peaks in different retention time groups
		based on frequency of paired mass distances. Reactomics
		analysis could also be performed to build PMD network, assign
		sources and make biomarker reaction discovery. GUIs for PMD
		analysis is also included as 'shiny' applications.
