		Inference for Panel Partially Observed Markov Processes // Data
		analysis based on panel partially-observed Markov process
		(PanelPOMP) models. To implement such models, simulate them and
		fit them to panel data, 'panelPomp' extends some of the
		facilities provided for time series data by the 'pomp' package.
		Implemented methods include filtering (panel particle
		filtering) and maximum likelihood estimation (Panel Iterated
		Filtering) as proposed in Breto, Ionides and King (2020) "Panel
		Data Analysis via Mechanistic Models"
