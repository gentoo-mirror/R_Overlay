		Drawing Graphs with 'grid' // Functions for drawing node-and-edge
		graphs that have been laid out by graphviz.  This provides an
		alternative rendering to that provided by the 'Rgraphviz'
		package, with two main advantages:  the rendering provided by
		'gridGraphviz' should be more similar to what 'graphviz' itself
		would draw; and rendering with 'grid' allows for post-hoc
		customisations using the named viewports and grobs that
		'gridGraphviz' produces.
