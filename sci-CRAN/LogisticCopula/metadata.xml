		A Copula Based Extension of Logistic Regression // An
		implementation of a method of extending a logistic regression
		model beyond linear effects of the co-variates. The extension
		in is constructed by first equating the logistic regression
		model to a naive Bayes model where all the margins are
		specified to follow natural exponential distributions
		conditional on Y, that is, a model for Y given X that is
		specified through the distribution of X given Y, where the
		columns of X are assumed to be mutually independent conditional
		on Y. Subsequently, the model is expanded by adding vine -
		copulas to relax the assumption of mutual independence, where
		pair-copulas are added in a stage-wise, forward selection
		manner. Some heuristics are employed during the process of
		selecting edges, as well as the families of pair-copula models.
		After each component is added, the parameters are updated by a
		(smaller) number of gradient steps to maximise the likelihood.
		When the algorithm has stopped adding edges, based the
		criterion that a new edge should improve the likelihood more
		than k times the number new parameters, the parameters are
		updated with a larger number of gradient steps, or until
		convergence.
