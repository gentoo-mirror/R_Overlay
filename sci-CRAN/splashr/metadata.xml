		Tools to Work with the 'Splash' 'JavaScript' Rendering and
		Scraping Service // 'Splash'
		https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash is a 'JavaScript'
		rendering service. It is a lightweight web browser with an
		'HTTP' API, implemented in 'Python' using 'Twisted' and 'QT'
		and provides some of the core functionality of the 'RSelenium'
		or 'seleniumPipes' R packages in a lightweight footprint. Some
		of 'Splash' features include the ability to process multiple
		web pages in parallel; retrieving 'HTML' results and/or take
		screen shots; disabling images or use 'Adblock Plus' rules to
		make rendering faster; executing custom 'JavaScript' in page
		context; getting detailed rendering info in 'HAR' format.
