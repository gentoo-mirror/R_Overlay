		Double Machine Learning //
		Yang(2020,doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.01.018) come up with
		Double Machine Learning model ,it is based on this model, using
		four machine learning methods-- bagging, Boosting, random
		forest and neural network, and then  based on the four models
		for two different combinations of the integrated model --
		linear model combination and random forest .
