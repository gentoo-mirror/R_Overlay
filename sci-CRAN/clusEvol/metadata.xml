		A Procedure for Cluster Evolution Analytics // Cluster Evolution
		Analytics allows us to use exploratory what if questions in the
		sense that the present information of an object is plugged-in a
		dataset in a previous time frame so that we can explore its
		evolution (and of its neighbors) to the present. See the URL
		for the papers associated with this package, as for instance,
		Morales-Oate and Morales-Oate (2024)
