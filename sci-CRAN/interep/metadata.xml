		Interaction Analysis of Repeatedly Measured Data // Extensive
		penalized variable selection methods have been developed in the
		past two decades for analyzing high dimensional omics data,
		such as gene expressions, single nucleotide polymorphisms
		(SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs) and others. However,
		lipidomics data have been rarely investigated by using high
		dimensional variable selection methods. This package
		incorporates our recently developed penalization procedures to
		conduct interaction analysis for high dimensional lipidomics
		data with repeated measurements. The core module of this
		package is developed in C++. The development of this software
		package and the associated statistical methods have been
		partially supported by an Innovative Research Award from
		Johnson Cancer Research Center, Kansas State University.
