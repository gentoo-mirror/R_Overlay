		Automated Linear Regression Diagnostic // Provides a set of
		streamlined functions that allow easy generation of linear
		regression diagnostic plots necessarily for checking linear
		model assumptions. This package is meant for easy scheming of
		linear regression diagnostics, while preserving merits of "The
		Grammar of Graphics" as implemented in 'ggplot2'. See the
		'ggplot2' website for more information regarding the specific
		capability of graphics.
