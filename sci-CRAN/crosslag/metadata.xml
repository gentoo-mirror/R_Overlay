		Perform Linear or Nonlinear Cross Lag Analysis // Linear or
		nonlinear cross-lagged panel model can be built from input
		data. Users can choose the appropriate method from three
		methods for constructing nonlinear cross lagged models. These
		three methods include polynomial regression, generalized
		additive model and generalized linear mixed model.In addition,
		a function for determining linear relationships is provided.
		Relevant knowledge of cross lagged models can be learned
		through the paper by Fredrik Falkenstrm (2024)
		doi:10.1016/j.cpr.2024.102435 and the paper by A Gasparrini
		(2010) doi:10.1002/sim.3940.
