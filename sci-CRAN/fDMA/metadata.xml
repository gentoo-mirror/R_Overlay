		Dynamic Model Averaging and Dynamic Model Selection for
		Continuous Outcomes // It allows to estimate Dynamic Model
		Averaging, Dynamic Model Selection and Median Probability
		Model. The original methods (see References) are implemented,
		as well as, selected further modifications of these methods. In
		particular the User might choose between recursive moment
		estimation and exponentially moving average for variance
		updating. Inclusion probabilities might be modified in a way
		using Google Trends. The code is written in a way which
		minimises the computational burden (which is quite an obstacle
		for Dynamic Model Averaging if many variables are used). For
		example, this package allows for parallel computations under
		Windows machines. Additionally, the User might reduce a set of
		models according to a certain algorithm. The package is
		designed in a way that is hoped to be especially useful in
		economics and finance. (Research funded by the Polish National
		Science Centre grant under the contract number
		DEC-2015/19/N/HS4/00205.)
