		Dynamic Model Averaging and Dynamic Model Selection for
		Continuous Outcomes // Allows to estimate dynamic model
		averaging, dynamic model selection and median probability
		model. The original methods are implemented, as well as,
		selected further modifications of these methods. In particular
		the user might choose between recursive moment estimation and
		exponentially moving average for variance updating. Inclusion
		probabilities might be modified in a way using 'Google Trends'.
		The code is written in a way which minimises the computational
		burden (which is quite an obstacle for dynamic model averaging
		if many variables are used). For example, this package allows
		for parallel computations and Occam's window approach. The
		package is designed in a way that is hoped to be especially
		useful in economics and finance. Main reference: Raftery, A.E.,
