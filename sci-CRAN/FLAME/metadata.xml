		A Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly Approach to Causal
		Inference // The 'FLAME' (Fast Large-scale Almost Matching
		Exactly) package implements the matching algorithm in Roy,
		Rudin, Volfovsky, and Wang (2017) arXiv:1707.06315. 'FLAME'
		performs matching of treatment and control units in the
		potential outcomes framework for large categorical datasets.
		'FLAME' creates matches that include as many covariates as
		possible, and sequentially drops covariates that are less
		useful based on a match quality measure. Match quality combines
		two important elements  it considers predictive power from
		machine learning on a hold out training set, and a balancing
		factor to ensure that it does not remove a covariate that would
		ruin overlap between treatment and control groups. Currently
		the 'FLAME' package applies to categorical data, and provides
		two approaches for implementation - bit vectors and database
		management systems (e.g., 'PostgreSQL', 'SQLite'). For data
		that has been adequately processed and fits in memory, bit
		vectors should be applied. For extremely large data that does
		not fit in memory, database systems should be applied.
