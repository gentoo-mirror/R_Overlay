		Interpretable Matching for Causal Inference // Efficient
		implementations of the algorithms in the Almost-Matching-
		Exactly framework for interpretable matching in causal
		inference. These algorithms match units via a learned, weighted
		Hamming distance that determines which covariates are more
		important to match on. For more information and examples, see
		the Almost-Matching-Exactly website.
