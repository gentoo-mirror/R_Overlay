		Decomposes a Level Shifted Time Series // Explains the behavior
		of a time series by decomposing it into its trend, seasonality
		and residuals. It is built to perform very well in the presence
		of significant level shifts. It is designed to play well with
		any breakpoint algorithm and any smoothing algorithm. Currently
		defaults to 'lowess' for smoothing and 'strucchange' for
		breakpoint identification. The package is useful in areas such
		as trend analysis, time series decomposition, breakpoint
		identification and anomaly detection.
