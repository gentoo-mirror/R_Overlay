		Sorted L1 Penalized Estimation // Efficient implementations for
		Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE): generalized linear
		models regularized with the sorted L1-norm (Bogdan et al.
		2015). Supported models include ordinary least-squares
		regression, binomial regression, multinomial regression, and
		Poisson regression. Both dense and sparse  predictor matrices
		are supported. In addition, the package features predictor
		screening rules that enable fast and efficient solutions to
		high-dimensional problems.
