		Two Way Neutrosophic ANOVA // Dealing with neutrosophic data of
		the form N=D+I(where N is a Neutrosophic number ,D is the
		determinant part of the number and I is  the indeterminacy
		part) using the neutrosophic two way anova test keeps the type
		I error low. This algorithm calculates the fisher statistics
		when we have a neutrosophic data, also tests two hypothesizes,
		first is to test differences between treatments, and second is
		to test differences between sectors. For more information see
