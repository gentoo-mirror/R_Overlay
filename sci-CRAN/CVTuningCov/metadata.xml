		Regularized Estimators of Covariance Matrices with CV Tuning //
		This is a package for selecting tuning parameters based on
		cross-validation (CV) in regularized estimators of large
		covariance matrices. Four regularized methods are implemented:
		banding, tapering, hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding. Two
		types of matrix norms are applied: Frobenius norm and operator
		norm. Two types of CV are considered: K-fold CV and random CV.
		Usually K-fold CV use K-1 folds to train a model and the rest
		one fold to validate the model. The reverse version trains a
		model with 1 fold and validates with the rest with K-1 folds.
		Random CV randomly splits the data set to two parts, a training
		set and a validation set with user-specified sizes.
