		Compute Moments Related to Beta-Wishart and Inverse Beta-Wishart
		Distributions // Provides functions for computing moments and
		coefficients related to the Beta-Wishart and Inverse Beta-
		Wishart distributions. It includes functions for calculating
		the expectation of matrix-valued functions of the Beta-Wishart
		distribution, coefficient matrices C_k and H_k, expectation of
		matrix-valued functions of the inverse Beta-Wishart
		distribution, and inverse coefficient matrices tilde C_k and
		tilde H_k. For more details, refer to the paper "On the
		Expectations of Equivariant Matrix-valued Functions of Wishart
		and Inverse Wishart Matrices" by Grant Hillier and Raymond Kan.
