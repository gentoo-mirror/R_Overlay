		The Data Defect Index for Samples that May not be IID //
		Implements Meng's data defect index (ddi), which represents the
		degree of sample bias relative to an iid sample. The data
		defect correlation (ddc) represents the correlation between the
		outcome of interest and the selection into the sample; when the
		sample selection is independent across the population, the ddc
		is zero. Details are in Meng (2018) doi:10.1214/18-AOAS1161SF,
		"Statistical Paradises and Paradoxes in Big Data (I): Law of
		Large Populations, Big Data Paradox, and the 2016 US
		Presidential Election." Survey estimates from the Cooperative
		Congressional Election Study (CCES) is included to replicate
		the article's results.
