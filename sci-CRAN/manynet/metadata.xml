		Many Ways to Make, Modify, Map, Mark, and Measure Myriad Networks
		// Many tools for making, modifying, mapping, marking,
		measuring, and motifs and memberships of many different types
		of networks. All functions operate with matrices, edge lists,
		and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects, and on one-
		mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
		The package includes functions for importing and exporting,
		creating and generating networks, modifying networks and node
		and tie attributes, and describing and visualizing networks
		with sensible defaults.
