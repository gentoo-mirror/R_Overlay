		Many Ways to Make, Modify, Mark, and Map Myriad Networks // A set
		of tools for making, modifying, marking, and mapping many
		different types of networks. All functions operate with
		matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph'
		objects, and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes
		three-mode networks. The package includes functions for
		importing and exporting, creating and generating networks,
		modifying networks and node and tie attributes, and describing
		and visualizing networks with sensible defaults.
