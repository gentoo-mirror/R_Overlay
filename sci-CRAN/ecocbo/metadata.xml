		Calculating Optimum Sampling Effort in Community Ecology // A
		system for calculating the optimal sampling effort, based on
		the ideas of "Ecological cost-benefit optimization" as
		developed by A. Underwood (1997, ISBN 0 521 55696 1). Data is
		obtained from simulated ecological communities with prep_data()
		which formats and arranges the initial data, and then the
		optimization follows the following procedure of four functions:
		(1) prep_data() takes the original dataset and creates
		simulated sets that can be used as a basis for estimating
		statistical power and type II error. (2) sim_beta() is used to
		estimate the statistical power for the different sampling
		efforts specified by the user. (3) sim_cbo() calculates then
		the optimal sampling effort, based on the statistical power and
		the sampling costs. Additionally, (4) scompvar() calculates the
		variation components necessary for (5) Underwood_cbo() to
		calculate the optimal combination of number of sites and
		samples depending on either an economic budget or on a desired
		statistical accuracy. Lastly, (6) plot_power() helps the user
		visualize the results of sim_beta().
