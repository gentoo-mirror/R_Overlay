		Calculating Optimum Sampling Effort in Community Ecology // A
		system for calculating the optimal sampling effort, based on
		the ideas of "Ecological cost-benefit optimization" as
		developed by A. Underwood (1997, ISBN 0 521 55696 1). Data is
		obtained from simulated ecological communities with prep_data()
		which formats and arranges the initial data, and then the
		optimization follows the following procedure of four functions:
		(1) scompvar() calculates the variation components necessary
		for (2) sim_cbo() to calculate the optimal combination of
		number of sites and samples depending on either an economic
		budget or on a desired statistical accuracy. Additionally, (3)
		sim_beta() estimates statistical power and type 2 error by
		using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance, and (6)
		plot_power() represents the results of the previous function.
