		Calculating Optimum Sampling Effort in Community Ecology // A
		system for calculating the optimal sampling effort, based on
		the ideas of "Ecological cost-benefit optimization" as
		developed by A. Underwood (1997, ISBN 0 521 55696 1). Data is
		obtained from simulated ecological communities, and the
		optimization follows the following procedure of four functions
		(1) sim_beta() estimates statistical power and type 2 error by
		using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance, (2)
		plot_power() represents the results of the previous function,
		(3) scompvar() calculates the variation components necessary
		for (4) sim_cbo() to calculate the optimal combination of
		number of sites and samples depending on either an economical
		budget or on a desired statistical accuracy.
