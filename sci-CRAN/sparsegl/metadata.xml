		Sparse Group Lasso // Efficient implementation of sparse group
		lasso with optional bound constraints on the coefficients; see
		doi:10.18637/jss.v110.i06.  It supports the use of a sparse
		design matrix as well as returning coefficient estimates in a
		sparse matrix. Furthermore, it correctly calculates the degrees
		of freedom to allow for information criteria rather than cross-
		validation with very large data. Finally, the interface to
		compiled code avoids unnecessary copies and allows for the use
		of long integers.
