		Sparse Group Lasso // Efficient implementation of sparse group
		lasso with optional bound constraints on the coefficients. It
		supports the use of a sparse design matrix as well as returning
		coefficient estimates in a sparse matrix. Furthermore, it
		correctly calculates the degrees of freedom to allow for
		information criteria rather than cross-validation with very
		large data. Finally, the interface to compiled code avoids
		unnecessary copies and allows for the use of long integers.
