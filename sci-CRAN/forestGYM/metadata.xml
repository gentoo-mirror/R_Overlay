		Forest Growth and Yield Model Based on Clutter Model // The
		Clutter model is a significant forest growth simulation tool.
		Grounded on individual trees and comprehensively considering
		factors such as competition among trees and the impact of
		environmental elements on growth, it can accurately reflect the
		growth process of forest stands. It can be applied in areas
		like forest resource management, harvesting planning, and
		ecological research. With the help of the Clutter model, people
		can better understand the dynamic changes of forests and
		provide a scientific basis for rational forest management and
		protecting the ecological environment. This R package can
		effectively realize the construction of forest growth and
		harvest models based on the Clutter model and achieve optimized
		forest management.References: Farias A, Soares C, Leite H et
