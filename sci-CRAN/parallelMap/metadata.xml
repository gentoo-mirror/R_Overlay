		Unified Interface to Parallelization Back-Ends // Unified
		parallelization framework for multiple back-end, designed for
		internal package and interactive usage.  The main operation is
		parallel mapping over lists.  Supports 'local', 'multicore',
		'mpi' and 'BatchJobs' mode.  Allows tagging of the parallel
		operation with a level name that can be later selected by the
		user to switch on parallel execution for exactly this
		operation.
