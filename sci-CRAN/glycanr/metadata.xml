		Tools for Analysing N-Glycan Data // Useful utilities in N-glycan
		data analysis. This package tries to fill the gap in N-glycan
		data analysis by providing easy to use functions for basic
		operations on data (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycomics
		for more details on Glycomics). At the moment 'glycanr' is
		mostly oriented to data obtained by UPLC (Ultra Performance
		Liquid Chromatography) and LCMS (Liquid chromatographymass
		spectrometry) analysis of Plasma and IgG glycome.
