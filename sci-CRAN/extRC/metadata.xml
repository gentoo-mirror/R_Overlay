		Extended RC Models for Contingency Tables // Maximum likelihood
		estimation of an extended class of row-column (RC) association
		models for two-dimensional contingency tables, which are
		formulated by a condition of reduced rank on a matrix of
		extended association parameters; see Forcina (2019)
		arXiv:1910.13848. These parameters are defined by choosing the
		logit type for the row and column variables among four
		different options and a transformation derived from suitable
		divergence measures.
