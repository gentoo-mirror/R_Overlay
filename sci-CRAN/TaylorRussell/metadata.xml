		A Taylor-Russell Function for Multiple Predictors // The Taylor
		Russell model is a widely used method for assessing test
		validity in personnel selections tasks. The three functions in
		this package extend this model in a number of notable ways.
		TR() estimates test validity for a single selection test via
		the original Taylor Russell model. It extends this model by
		allowing users greater flexibility in argument choice. For
		example, users can specify any three of the four parameters
		(base rate, selection ratio, criterion validity, and positive
		predictive value) of the Taylor Russell model and estimate the
		remaining parameter (see the help file for examples).  The
		TaylorRussell() function generalizes the original Taylor
		Russell model to allow for multiple selection tests
		(predictors).  To our knowledge, this is the first
		generalization of the Taylor Russell model to allow for three
		or more selection tests (it is also the first to correctly
		handle models with two selection tests). TRDemo() is a 'shiny'
		program for illustrating the underlying logic of the Taylor
		Russell model. Taylor, HC and Russell, JT (1939) "The
		relationship of validity coefficients to the practical
