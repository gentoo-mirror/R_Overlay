		Asymmetric Second Order Rotatable Designs (AsymmetricSORDs) //
		Response surface designs (RSDs) are widely used for Response
		Surface Methodology (RSM) based optimization studies, which aid
		in exploring the relationship between a group of explanatory
		variables and one or more response variable(s) (G.E.P. Box and
		K.B. Wilson (1951), "On the experimental attainment of optimum
		conditions" ; M. Hemavathi, Shashi Shekhar, Eldho Varghese,
		Seema Jaggi, Bikas Sinha  Nripes Kumar Mandal (2022) DOI:
		10.1080/03610926.2021.1944213."Theoretical developments in
		response surface designs: an informative review and further
		thoughts".). Second order rotatable designs are the most
		prominent and popular class of designs used for process and
		product optimization trials but it is suitable for situations
		when all the number of levels for each factor is the same. In
		many practical situations, RSDs with asymmetric levels (J.S.
		Mehta and M.N. Das (1968). "Asymmetric rotatable designs and
		orthogonal transformations" ; M. Hemavathi, Eldho Varghese,
		Shashi Shekhar  Seema Jaggi (2020) DOI:
		10.1080/02664763.2020.1864817. "Sequential asymmetric third
		order rotatable designs (SATORDs)" .) are more suitable as
		these designs explore more regions in the design space.This
		package contains functions named Asords() ,CCD_coded(),
		CCD_original(), SORD_coded() and SORD_original() for generating
		asymmetric/symmetric RSDs along with the randomized layout. It
		also contains another function named Pred.var() for generating
		the variance of predicted response as well as the moment matrix
		based on a second order model.
