		estimated marginal means (EMMs) for many linear, generalized
		linear, and mixed models. Compute contrasts or linear functions
		of EMMs, trends, and comparisons of slopes. Plots and other
		displays. Least-squares means are discussed, and the term
		"estimated marginal means" is suggested, in Searle, Speed, and
		Milliken (1980) Population marginal means in the linear model:
		An alternative to least squares means, The American
		Statistician 34(4), 216-221 doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031.
