		Bayesian Neural Network for High-Dimensional Nonlinear Variable
		Selection // Perform Bayesian variable selection for high-
		dimensional nonlinear systems and also can be used to test
		nonlinearity for a general regression problem. The computation
		can be accelerated using multiple CPUs. You can refer to
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1409122 for more detail.
