		Bayesian Neural Network for High-Dimensional Nonlinear Variable
		Selection // Perform Bayesian variable selection for high-
		dimensional nonlinear systems and also can be used to test
		nonlinearity for a general regression problem. The computation
		can be accelerated using multiple CPUs. You can refer to Liang,
		F., Li, Q. and Zhou, L. (2017) at https://www.samsi.info/wp-
		content/uploads/2016/09/SAMSI_DPDA-Liang.pdf for detail. The
		publication "Bayesian Neural Networks for Selection of drug
		sensitive Genes" will be appear on Journals of American
		Statistical Association soon.
