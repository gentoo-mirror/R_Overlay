		Declare and Diagnose Research Designs // Researchers can
		characterize and learn about the properties of research designs
		before implementation using `DeclareDesign`. Ex ante
		declaration and diagnosis of designs can help researchers
		clarify the strengths and limitations of their designs and to
		improve their properties, and can help readers evaluate a
		research strategy prior to implementation and without access to
		results. It can also make it easier for designs to be shared,
		replicated, and critiqued.
