		Conduct Simulation Study of Bayesian Optimal Interval Design with
		BOIN-ET Family // Bayesian optimal interval based on both
		efficacy and toxicity outcomes (BOIN-ET) design is a model-
		assisted oncology phase I/II trial design, aiming to establish
		an optimal biological dose accounting for efficacy and toxicity
		in the framework of dose-finding. Some extensions of BOIN-ET
		design are also available to allow for time-to-event efficacy
		and toxicity outcomes based on cumulative and pending data
		(time-to-event BOIN-ET: TITE-BOIN-ET), ordinal graded efficacy
		and toxicity outcomes (generalized BOIN-ET: gBOIN-ET), and
		their combination (TITE-gBOIN-ET). 'boinet' is a package to
		implement the BOIN-ET design family and supports the conduct of
		simulation studies to assess operating characteristics of BOIN-
		ET, TITE-BOIN-ET, gBOIN-ET, and TITE-gBOIN-ET, where users can
		choose design parameters in flexible and straightforward ways
		depending on their own application.
