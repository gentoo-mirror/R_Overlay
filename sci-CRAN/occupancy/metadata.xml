		Probability Functions for Occupancy Distributions // The
		classical and extended occupancy distributions occur in cases
		where balls are randomly allocated to bins. The PDF, CDF,
		quantile functions, generation of random variates, and
		calculating the first four central moments of the distributions
		are implemented as described in ONeill (2019)
