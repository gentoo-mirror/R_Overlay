		Calculating Solar Radiation and Related Variables Based on
		Location, Time and Topographical Conditions // For surface
		energy models and estimation of solar positions and components
		with varying topography, time and locations. The functions
		calculate solar top-of-atmosphere, open, diffuse and direct
		components, atmospheric transmittance and diffuse factors, day
		length, sunrise and sunset, solar azimuth, zenith, altitude,
		incidence, and hour angles, earth declination angle, equation
		of time, and solar constant. Details about the methods and
		equations are explained in Seyednasrollah, Bijan, Mukesh Kumar,
		and Timothy E. Link. 'On the role of vegetation density on net
		snow cover radiation at the forest floor.' Journal of
		Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 118.15 (2013): 8359-8374,
		doi:10.1002/jgrd.50575.
