		Fitting, Diagnostics, and Plotting Functions for Infinite
		Mixtures of Infinite Factor Analysers and Related Models //
		Provides flexible Bayesian estimation of Infinite Mixtures of
		Infinite Factor Analysers and related models, for
		nonparametrically clustering high-dimensional data, introduced
		by Murphy et al. (2017) arXiv:1701.07010. The IMIFA model
		conducts Bayesian nonparametric model-based clustering with
		factor analytic covariance structures without recourse to model
		selection criteria to choose the number of clusters or cluster-
		specific latent factors, mostly via efficient Gibbs updates.
		Model-specific diagnostic tools are also provided, as well as
		many options for plotting results and conducting posterior
		inference on parameters of interest.
