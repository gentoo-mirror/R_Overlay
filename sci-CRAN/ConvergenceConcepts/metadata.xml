		Seeing Convergence Concepts in Action // This is a pedagogical
		package, designed to help students understanding convergence of
		random variables. It provides a way to investigate
		interactively various modes of convergence (in probability,
		almost surely, in law and in mean) of a sequence of i.i.d.
		random variables. Visualisation of simulated sample paths is
		possible through interactive plots. The approach is illustrated
		by examples and exercises through the function 'investigate',
		as described in Lafaye de Micheaux and Liquet (2009)
		doi:10.1198/tas.2009.0032. The user can study his/her own
		sequences of random variables.
