		Calculates Microbial Lag Duration (on the Population Level) from
		Provided Growth Curve Data // Microbial growth is often
		measured by growth curves i.e. a table of population sizes and
		times of measurements. This package allows to use such growth
		curve data to determine the duration of "microbial lag phase"
		i.e. the time needed for microbes to restart divisions. It
		implements the most commonly used methods to calculate the lag
		duration, these methods are discussed and described in Opalek
		et.al. 2022. Citation: Smug, B. J., Opalek, M., Necki, M.,

		based application and an R package for calculating the duration
		of microbial lag phase. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 15,
