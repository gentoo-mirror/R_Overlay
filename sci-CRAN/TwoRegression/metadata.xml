		Develop and Apply Two-Regression Algorithms // Facilitates
		development and application of two-regression algorithms for
		research-grade wearable devices. It provides an easy way for
		users to access previously-developed algorithms, and also to
		develop their own. Initial motivation came from Hibbing PR,
		LaMunion SR, Kaplan AS,  Crouter SE (2018)
		doi:10.1249/MSS.0000000000001532. However, other algorithms are
		now supported. Please see the associated references in the
		package documentation for full details of the algorithms that
		are supported.
