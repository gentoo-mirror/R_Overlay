		Presentation-Quality Tables, Displayed Using 'ggplot2' //
		Presentation-quality tables are displayed as plots on an R
		graphics device.  Although there are other packages that format
		tables for display, this package is unique in combining two
		features: (a) It is aware of the logical structure of the table
		being presented, and makes use of that for automatic layout and
		styling of the table.  This avoids the need for most manual
		adjustments to achieve an attractive result. (b) It displays
		tables using 'ggplot2' graphics.  Therefore a table can be
		presented anywhere a graph could be, with no more effort.
		External software such as LaTeX or HTML or their viewers is not
		required.  The package provides a full set of tools to control
		the style and appearance of tables, including titles, footnotes
		and reference marks, horizontal and vertical rules, and spacing
		of rows and columns.  Methods are included to display matrices;
		data frames; tables created by R's ftable(), table(), and
		xtabs() functions; and tables created by the 'tables' and
		'xtable' packages.  Methods can be added to display other
		table-like objects.  A vignette is included that illustrates
		usage and options available in the package.
