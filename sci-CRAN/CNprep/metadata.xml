		Pre-process DNA Copy Number (CN) Data for Detection of CN Events
		// This package evaluates DNA copy number data, using both
		their initial form (copy number as a noisy function of genomic
		position) and their approximation by a piecewise-constant
		function (segmentation), for the purpose of identifying genomic
		regions where the copy number differs from the norm.
