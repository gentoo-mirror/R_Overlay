		Pre-Process DNA Copy Number (CN) Data for Detection of CN Events
		// DNA copy number data evaluation using both their initial
		form (copy number as a noisy function of genomic position) and
		their approximation by a piecewise-constant function
		(segmentation), for the purpose of identifying genomic regions
		where the copy number differs from the norm.
