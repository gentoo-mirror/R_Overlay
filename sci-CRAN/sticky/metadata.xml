		Persist Attributes Across Data Operations // In base R, object
		attributes are lost when objects are modified by common data
		operations such as subset, filter, slice, append, extract etc.
		This packages allows objects to be marked as 'sticky' and have
		attributes persisted during these operations or when inserted
		into or extracted from list-like or table-like objects.
