		Self-Similarity Test for Normality // Implements the Self-
		Similarity Test for Normality (SSTN), a new statistical test
		designed to assess whether a given sample originates from a
		normal distribution. The procedure is based on iteratively
		estimating the characteristic function of the sum of
		standardized i.i.d. random variables and comparing it to the
		characteristic function of the standard normal distribution. A
		Monte Carlo procedure is used to determine the empirical
		distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.
		Details of the methodology are described in Anarat and
		Schwender (2025), "A normality test based on self-similarity"
		(Submitted).
