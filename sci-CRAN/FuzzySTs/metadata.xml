		Fuzzy Statistical Tools // The main goal of this package is to
		present various fuzzy statistical tools. It intends to provide
		an implementation of the theoretical and empirical approaches
		presented in the book entitled "The signed distance measure in
		fuzzy statistical analysis. Some theoretical, empirical and
		programming advances" doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-76916-1. For the
		theoretical approaches, see Berkachy R. and Donze L. (2019)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03368-2_1. For the empirical approaches,
		see Berkachy R. and Donze L. (2016) ISBN: 978-989-758-201-1).
		Important (non-exhaustive) implementation highlights of this
		package are as follows: (1) a numerical procedure to estimate
		the fuzzy difference and the fuzzy square. (2) two numerical
		methods of fuzzification. (3) a function performing different
		possibilities of distances, including the signed distance and
		the generalized signed distance for instance with all its
		properties. (4) numerical estimations of fuzzy statistical
		measures such as the variance, the moment, etc. (5) two methods
		of estimation of the bootstrap distribution of the likelihood
		ratio in the fuzzy context. (6) an estimation of a fuzzy
		confidence interval by the likelihood ratio method. (7) testing
		fuzzy hypotheses and/or fuzzy data by fuzzy confidence
		intervals in the Kwakernaak - Kruse and Meyer sense. (8) a
		general method to estimate the fuzzy p-value with fuzzy
		hypotheses and/or fuzzy data. (9) a method of estimation of
		global and individual evaluations of linguistic questionnaires.
		(10) numerical estimations of multi-ways analysis of variance
		models in the fuzzy context. The unbalance in the considered
		designs are also foreseen.
