		Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation // Targeted maximum
		likelihood estimation of point treatment effects (Targeted
		Maximum Likelihood Learning, The International Journal of
		Biostatistics, 2(1), 2006.  This version automatically
		estimates the additive treatment effect among the treated (ATT)
		and among the controls (ATC).  The tmle() function calculates
		the adjusted marginal difference in mean outcome associated
		with a binary point treatment, for continuous or binary
		outcomes.  Relative risk and odds ratio estimates are also
		reported for binary outcomes. Missingness in the outcome is
		allowed, but not in treatment assignment or baseline covariate
		values.  The population mean is calculated when there is
		missingness, and no variation in the treatment assignment. The
		tmleMSM() function estimates the parameters of a marginal
		structural model for a binary point treatment effect. Effect
		estimation stratified by a binary mediating variable is also
		available. An ID argument can be used to identify repeated
		measures. Default settings call 'SuperLearner' to estimate the
		Q and g portions of the likelihood, unless values or a user-
		supplied regression function are passed in as arguments.
