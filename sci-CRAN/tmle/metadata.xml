		Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation // tmle implements
		targeted maximum likelihood estimation, first described in van
		der Laan and Rubin, 2006 (Targeted Maximum Likelihood Learning,
		The International Journal of biostatistics, 2(1), 2006.  This
		version adds the tmleMSM function to the package, for
		estimating the parameters of a marginal structural model (MSM)
		for a binary point treatment effect.  The tmle function
		calculates the adjusted marginal difference in mean outcome
		associated with a binary point treatment, for continuous or
		binary outcomes.  Relative risk and odds ratio estimates are
		also reported for binary outcomes. Missingness in the outcome
		is allowed, but not in treatment assignment or baseline
		covariate values. Effect estimation stratified by a binary
		mediating variable is also available. The population mean is
		calculated when there is missingness, and no variation in the
		treatment assignment.  An ID argument can be used to identify
		repeated measures. Default settings call SuperLearner to
		estimate the Q and g portions of the likelihood, unless values
		or a user-supplied regression function are passed in as
		arguments.
