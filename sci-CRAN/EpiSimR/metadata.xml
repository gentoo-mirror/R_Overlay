		A 'Shiny' App to Simulate the Dynamics of Epidemic and Endemic
		Diseases Spread // The 'EpiSimR' package provides an
		interactive 'shiny' app based on deterministic compartmental
		mathematical modeling for simulating and visualizing the
		dynamics of epidemic and endemic disease spread. It allows
		users to explore various intervention strategies, including
		vaccination and isolation, by adjusting key epidemiological
		parameters. The methodology follows the approach described by
		Brauer (2008) doi:10.1007/978-3-540-78911-6_2. Thanks to
		'shiny' package.
