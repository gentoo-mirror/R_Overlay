		Detect Small Changes in Process Mean using CUSUM Control Chart by
		v-Mask // The cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart is
		considered to be an alternative or complementary to Shewhart
		control charts in statistical process control (SPC)
		applications, owing to its higher sensitivity to small shifts
		in the process mean. It utilizes all the available data rather
		than the last few ones used in Shewhart control charts for
		quick decision making. V-mask is a traditional technique for
		separating meaningful data from unusual circumstances in a
		Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control chart; for see details about
		v-mask see Montgomery (1985, ISBN:978-0471656319). The mask is
		a V-shaped overlay placed on the CUSUM chart so that one arm of
		the V lines up with the slope of data points, making it easy to
		see data points that lie outside the slope and to determine
		whether these points should be discarded as random events, or
		treated as a performance trend that should be addressed. But,
		complex computations is one disadvantage V-mask method for
		detect small changes in mean using CUSUM control chart. Package
		'vMask' can help to the applied users to overcome this
		challenge by considering six different methods which each of
		them are based on different information.
