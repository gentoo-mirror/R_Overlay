		Parallel Random Number Generation on GPU // Builds on 'gpuR' and
		utilizes the 'clRNG' ('OpenCL') library to provide efficient
		tools to generate independent random numbers in parallel on a
		GPU and save the results as 'R' objects, ensuring high-quality
		random numbers even when 'R' is used interactively or in an ad-
		hoc manner. Includes Fisher's simulation method adapted from
		Patefield, William M (1981) doi:10.2307/2346669 and 'MRG31k3p'
		Random Number Generator from 'clRNG' library by Advanced Micro
		Devices, Inc. (2015) https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clRNG.
