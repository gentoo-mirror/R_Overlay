		Dual Scaling Analysis of Data // Dual Scaling, developed by
		Professor Shizuhiko Nishisato (1994, ISBN: 0-9691785-3-6), is a
		fundamental technique in multivariate analysis used for data
		scaling and correspondence analysis. Its utility lies in its
		ability to represent multidimensional data in a lower-
		dimensional space, making it easier to visualize and understand
		underlying patterns in complex data. This technique has been
		implemented to handle various types of data, including
		Contingency and Frequency data (CF), Multiple-Choice data (MC),
		Sorting data (SO), Paired-Comparison data (PC), and Rank-Order
		data (RO), providing users with a powerful tool to explore
		relationships between variables and observations in various
		fields, from sociology to ecology, enabling deeper and more
		efficient analysis of multivariate datasets.
