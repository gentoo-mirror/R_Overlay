		Variable Selection and Inference for Partial Semiparametric
		Linear Mixed-Effects Model // Implements a partial linear
		semiparametric mixed-effects model (PLSMM) featuring a random
		intercept and applies a lasso penalty to both the fixed effects
		and the coefficients associated with the nonlinear function.
		The model also accommodates interactions between the nonlinear
		function and a grouping variable, allowing for the capture of
		group-specific nonlinearities. Nonlinear functions are modeled
		using a set of bases functions. Estimation is conducted using a
		penalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and the package
		offers flexibility in choosing between various information
		criteria for model selection. Post-selection inference is
		carried out using a debiasing method, while inference on the
		nonlinear functions employs a bootstrap approach.
