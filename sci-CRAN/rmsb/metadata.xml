		Bayesian Regression Modeling Strategies // A Bayesian companion
		to the 'rms' package, 'rmsb' provides Bayesian model fitting,
		post-fit estimation, and graphics.  It implements Bayesian
		regression models whose fit objects can be processed by 'rms'
		functions such as 'contrast()', 'summary()', 'Predict()',
		'nomogram()', and 'latex()'.  The fitting function currently
		implemented in the package is 'blrm()' for Bayesian logistic
		binary and ordinal regression with optional clustering,
		censoring, and departures from the proportional odds assumption
		using the partial proportional odds model of Peterson and
		Harrell (1990) https://www.jstor.org/stable/2347760.
