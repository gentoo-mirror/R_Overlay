		Clustering of Variables Around Latent Variables // Functions for
		the clustering of variables around Latent Variables, for 2-way
		or 3-way data. Each cluster of variables, which may be defined
		as a local or directional cluster, is associated with a latent
		variable. External variables measured on the same observations
		or/and additional information on the variables can be taken
		into account. A "noise" cluster or sparse latent variables can
		also be defined.
