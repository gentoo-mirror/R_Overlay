		Horn's Test of Principal Components/Factors // An implementation
		of Horn's technique for numerically and graphically evaluating
		the components or factors retained in a principle components
		analysis (PCA) or common factor analysis (FA). Horn's method
		contrasts eigenvalues produced through a PCA or FA on a number
		of random data sets of uncorrelated variables with the same
		number of variables and observations as the experimental or
		observational data set to produce eigenvalues for components or
		factors that are adjusted for the sample error-induced
		inflation. Components with adjusted eigenvalues greater than
		one are retained. paran may also be used to conduct parallel
		analysis following Glorfeld's (1995) suggestions to reduce the
		likelihood of over-retention.
