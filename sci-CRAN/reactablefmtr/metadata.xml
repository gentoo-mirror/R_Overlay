		Easily Customize Interactive Tables Made with Reactable //
		Enhance the styling of interactive reactable tables with easy-
		to-use and highly-customizable functions. Apply conditional
		formatting to cells with data bars, color scales, and icon
		sets. Utilize custom table themes inspired by popular websites
		and bootstrap themes. Increase the portability and
		reproducibility of reactable tables by embedding images from
		the web directly into cells. Save the final table output as a
		static image or interactive file (note this feature requires
		the 'webshot2' package which can be downloaded from
		https://github.com/rstudio/webshot2).
