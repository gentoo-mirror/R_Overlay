		Steady and Unsteady Open-Channel Flow Computation // A tool for
		undergraduate and graduate courses in open-channel hydraulics.
		Provides functions for computing normal and critical depths,
		steady-state water surface profiles (e.g. backwater curves) and
		unsteady flow computations (e.g. flood wave routing) as
		described in Koohafkan MC, Younis BA (2015). "Open-channel
		computation with R." The R Journal, 7(2), 249262. doi:
		10.32614/RJ-2015-034.
