		A Bayesian Repulsive Biclustering Model for Periodontal Data //
		BAREB, a BAyesian REpulsive Biclustering model, that can
		simultaneously cluster the Periodontal diseases (PD) patients
		and their tooth sites after taking the patient- and site-level
		covariates into consideration. BAREB uses the determinantal
		point process (DPP) prior to induce diversity among different
		biclusters to facilitate parsimony and interpretability.
		Essentially, BAREB is a cluster-wise linear model based on
		Yuliang (2019) arXiv:1902.05680.
