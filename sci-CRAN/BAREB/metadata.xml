		A Bayesian Repulsive Biclustering Model for Periodontal Data //
		Simultaneously clusters the Periodontal diseases (PD) patients
		and their tooth sites after taking the patient- and site-level
		covariates into consideration. 'BAREB' uses the determinantal
		point process (DPP) prior to induce diversity among different
		biclusters to facilitate parsimony and interpretability.
		Essentially, 'BAREB' is a cluster-wise linear model based on
		Yuliang (2020) doi:10.1002/sim.8536.
