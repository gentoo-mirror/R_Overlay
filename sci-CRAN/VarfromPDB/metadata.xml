		: Disease-Gene-Variant Relations Mining from the Public Databases
		and Literature // Captures and compiles the genes and variants
		related to a disease, a phenotype or a clinical feature from
		the public databases including HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology,
		http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/about.html), Orphanet
		http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/index.php, OMIM (Online
		Mendelian Inheritance in Man, http://www.omim.org), ClinVar
		http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar, and UniProt (Universal
		Protein Resource, http://www.uniprot.org) and PubMed abstracts.
		HPO provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic
		abnormalities encountered in human disease. HPO currently
		contains approximately 11,000 terms and over 115,000
		annotations to hereditary diseases. Orphanet is the reference
		portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs, whose
		aim is to help improve the diagnosis, care and treatment of
		patients with rare diseases. OMIM is a continuously updated
		catalog of human genes and genetic disorders and traits, with
		particular focus on the molecular relationship between genetic
		variation and phenotypic expression. ClinVar is a freely
		accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships
		among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting
		evidence. UniProt focuses on amino acid altering variants
		imported from Ensembl Variation databases. For Homo sapiens,
		the variants including human polymorphisms and disease
		mutations in the UniProt are manually curated  from UniProtKB
		/Swiss-Prot. Additionally, PubMed provides the primary and
		latest source of the information. Text mining was employed to
		capture the information from PubMed abstracts.
