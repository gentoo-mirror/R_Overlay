		Configurable Reporting on your External Compute Environment //
		Runs a series of configurable tests against a user's compute
		environment. This can be used for checking that things like a
		specific directory or an environment variable is available
		before you start an analysis. Alternatively, you can use the
		package's situation report when filing error reports with your
		compute infrastructure.
