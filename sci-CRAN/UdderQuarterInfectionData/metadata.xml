		Udder Quarter Infection Data // The udder quarter infection data
		set contains infection times of individual cow udder quarters
		with Corynebacterium bovis (Laevens et al. 1997
		DOI:10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(97)76295-7). Obviously, the four
		udder quarters are clustered within a cow, and udder quarters
		are sampled only approximately monthly, generating interval-
		censored data. The data set contains both covariates that
		change within a cow (e.g., front and rear udder quarters) and
		covariates that change between cows (e.g., parity [the number
		of previous calvings]). The correlation between udder infection
		times within a cow also is of interest, because this is a
		measure of the infectivity of the agent causing the disease.
		Various models have been applied to address the problem of
		interdependence for right-censored event times. These models,
		as applied to this data set, can be found back in the
		publications found in the reference list.
