		Parameter Estimation, and Plot Visualization of Adsorption
		Kinetic Models // Contains model fitting functions for linear
		and non-linear adsorption kinetic and diffusion models.
		Adsorption kinetics is used for characterizing the rate of
		solute adsorption and the time necessary for the adsorption
		process. Adsorption kinetics offers vital information on
		adsorption rate, adsorbent performance in response time, and
		mass transfer processes. In addition, diffusion models are
		included in the package as solute diffusion affects the
		adsorption kinetic experiments. This package consists of 20
		adsorption and diffusion models, including Pseudo First Order
		(PFO), Pseudo Second Order (PSO), Elovich, and Weber-Morris
		model (commonly called the intraparticle model) stated by
		Plazinski et al. (2009) doi:10.1016/j.cis.2009.07.009. This
		package also contains a summary function where the statistical
		errors of each model are ranked for a more straightforward
		determination of the best fit model.
