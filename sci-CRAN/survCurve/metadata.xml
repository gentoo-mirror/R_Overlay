		Plots Survival Curves Element by Element // Plots survival models
		from the 'survival' package. Additionally, it plots curves of
		multistate models from the 'mstate' package. Typically, a plot
		is drawn by the sequence survplot(), confIntArea(), survCurve()
		and nrAtRisk(). The separation of the plot in this 4 functions
		allows for great flexibility to make a custom plot for
		publication.
