		(SNF, FNS, SNSF) // Download and read datasets from the Swiss
		National Science Foundation (SNF, FNS, SNSF; https://snf.ch).

		Downloaded data can optionally be cached, to avoid repeated
		downloads of the same files.  There are also utilities for
		comparing different versions of datasets, i.e. to report added,
		removed and changed entries.
