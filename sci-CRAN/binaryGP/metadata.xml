		Fit and Predict a Gaussian Process Model with (Time-Series)
		Binary Response // Allows the estimation and prediction for
		binary Gaussian process model. The mean function can be assumed
		to have time-series structure. The estimation methods for the
		unknown parameters are based on penalized quasi-
		likelihood/penalized quasi-partial likelihood and restricted
		maximum likelihood. The predicted probability and its
		confidence interval are computed by Metropolis-Hastings
		algorithm. More details can be seen in Sung et al (2017)
		arXiv:1705.02511.
