		Searching for Footprints of Selection using "Extended Haplotype
		Homozygosity" Based Tests // Population genetic data in form of
		"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms" (SNPs) is often used to
		identify genomic regions that have been under recent natural or
		artificial selection and might provide clues about the
		molecular mechanisms of adaptation. The concept of an "Extended
		Haplotype Homozygosity" (EHH), introduced by (Sabeti 2002)
		doi:10.1038/nature01140, has given rise to several derived
		statistics designed for whole genome scans. The package
		provides functions to compute three of these, namely: "iHS"
		(Voight 2006) doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072 for detecting
		selection within a single population as well as "Rsb" (Tang
		2007) doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050171 and "XP-EHH" (Sabeti
		2007) doi:10.1038/nature06250 to detect (differential)
		selection between two populations. Various plotting functions
		are also included to facilitate visualization and
		interpretation of these statistics.
