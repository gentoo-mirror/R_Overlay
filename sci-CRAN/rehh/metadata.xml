		Searching for Footprints of Selection using 'Extended Haplotype
		Homozygosity' Based Tests // Population genetic data such as
		'Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms' (SNPs) is often used to
		identify genomic regions that have been under recent natural or
		artificial selection and might provide clues about the
		molecular mechanisms of adaptation. One approach, the concept
		of an 'Extended Haplotype Homozygosity' (EHH), introduced by
		(Sabeti 2002) doi:10.1038/nature01140, has given rise to
		several statistics designed for whole genome scans. The package
		provides functions to compute three of these, namely: 'iHS'
		(Voight 2006) doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072 for detecting
		positive or 'Darwinian' selection within a single population as
		well as 'Rsb' (Tang 2007) doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050171 and
		'XP-EHH' (Sabeti 2007) doi:10.1038/nature06250, targeted at
		differential selection between two populations. Various
		plotting functions are also included to facilitate
		visualization and interpretation of these statistics. Due to
		changes in the API, albeit mostly minor, this version is not
		compatible with versions 2.0.X.
