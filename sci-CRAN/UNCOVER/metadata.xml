		Utilising Normalisation Constant Optimisation via Edge Removal
		(UNCOVER) // Model data with a suspected clustering structure
		(either in co-variate space, regression space or both) using a
		Bayesian product model with a logistic regression likelihood.
		Observations are represented graphically and clusters are
		formed through various edge removals or additions. Cluster
		quality is assessed through the log Bayesian evidence of the
		overall model, which is estimated using either a Sequential
		Monte Carlo sampler or a suitable transformation of the
		Bayesian Information Criterion as a fast approximation of the
		former. The internal Iterated Batch Importance Sampling scheme
		(Chopin (2002 doi:10.1093/biomet/89.3.539)) is made available
		as a free standing function.
