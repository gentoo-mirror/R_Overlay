		'EMOTIONS: Ensemble Models for Lactation Curves' // Lactation
		curve modeling plays a central role in dairy production,
		supporting management decisions and the selection of animals
		with superior productivity and resilience. The package
		'EMOTIONS' fits 47 models for lactation curves and creates
		ensemble models using model averaging based on Akaike
		information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, root
		mean square percentage error, and mean squared error, variance
		of the predictions, cosine similarity for each model's
		predictions, and Bayesian Model Average. The daily production
		values predicted through the ensemble models can be used to
		estimate resilience indicators in the package. Additionally,
		the package allows the graphical visualization of the model
		ranks and the predicted lactation curves.
