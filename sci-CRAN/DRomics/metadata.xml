		Dose Response for Omics // Several functions are provided for
		dose-response (or concentration-response) characterization from
		omics data. 'DRomics' is especially dedicated to omics data
		obtained using a typical dose-response design, favoring a great
		number of tested doses (or concentrations, at least 6, and the
		more the better) rather than a great number of replicates (no
		need of three replicates). 'DRomics' provides functions 1) to
		check and normalize data, 2) to select monotonic or biphasic
		significantly responding items (e.g. probes, metabolites), 3)
		to choose the best-fit model among a predefined family of
		monotonic and biphasic models to describe each selected item 4)
		to derive a benchmark dose or concentration and a typology of
		response from each fitted curve. In the available version data
		are supposed to be single-channel microarray data transformed
		in log2, or another type of data that can be directly fitted by
		least-square regression without any normalization step. In the
		future this tool will also be able to process RNA-seq data. For
		further details see Larras et al (2018)
