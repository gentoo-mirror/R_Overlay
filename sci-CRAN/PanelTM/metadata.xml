		Two- And Three-Way Dynamic Panel Threshold Regression Model for
		Change Point Detection // Estimation of two- and three-way
		dynamic panel threshold regression models (Di Lascio and
		Perazzini (2024) https://repec.unibz.it/bemps104.pdf; Di Lascio
		and Perazzini (2022, ISBN:978-88-9193-231-0); Seo and Shin
		(2016) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.03.005) through the
		generalized method of moments based on the first difference
		transformation and the use of instrumental variables. The
		models can be used to find a change point detection in the time
		series. In addition, random number generation is also
		implemented.
