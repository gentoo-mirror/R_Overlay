		Statistical Framework for in Vivo Drug Combination Studies // A
		framework for evaluating drug combination effects in
		preclinical in vivo studies. 'SynergyLMM' provides functions to
		analyze longitudinal tumor growth experiments using mixed-
		effects models, perform time-resolved analyses of synergy and
		antagonism, evaluate model diagnostics and performance, and
		assess both post-hoc and a priori statistical power. The
		calculation of drug combination synergy follows the statistical
		framework provided by Demidenko and Miller (2019,
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0224137). The implementation and
		analysis of linear mixed-effect models is based on the methods
		described by Pinheiro and Bates (2000, doi:10.1007/b98882), and
		Gaecki and Burzykowski (2013, doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-3900-4).
