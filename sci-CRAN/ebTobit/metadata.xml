		Empirical Bayesian Tobit Matrix Estimation // Estimation tools
		for multidimensional Gaussian means using empirical Bayesian
		g-modeling. Methods are able to handle fully observed data as
		well as left-, right-, and interval-censored observations
		(Tobit likelihood); descriptions of these methods can be found
		in Barbehenn and Zhao (2023) arXiv:2306.07239. Additional,
		lower-level functionality based on Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956)
		doi:10.1214/aoms/1177728066 and Jiang and Zhang (2009)
		doi:10.1214/08-AOS638 is provided that can be used to
		accelerate many empirical Bayes and nonparametric maximum
		likelihood problems.
