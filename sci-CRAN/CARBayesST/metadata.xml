		Spatio-Temporal Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit
		Data // Implements a class of spatio-temporal generalised
		linear mixed models for areal unit data, with inference in a
		Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian or
		Poisson, but for some models only the binomial and Poisson data
		likelihoods are available. The spatio-temporal autocorrelation
		is modelled by  random effects,  which are assigned conditional
		autoregressive (CAR) style prior distributions. A number of
		different random effects structures are available, and full
		details are given in the vignette accompanying this package and
		the references in the help files. The creation of this package
		was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
		Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1 and the Medical Research
		Council (MRC) grant MR/L022184/1.
