		Spatio-Temporal Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit
		Data // Implements a class of univariate and multivariate
		spatio-temporal generalised linear mixed models for areal unit
		data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain
		Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be
		binomial, Gaussian, or Poisson, but for some models only the
		binomial and Poisson data likelihoods are available. The
		spatio-temporal autocorrelation is modelled by  random effects,
		which are assigned conditional autoregressive (CAR) style prior
		distributions. A number of different random effects structures
		are available, including models similar to Rushworth et al.
