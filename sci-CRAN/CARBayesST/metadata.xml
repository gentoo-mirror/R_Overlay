		Spatio-Temporal Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit
		Data // Implements a class of spatio-temporal generalised
		linear mixed models for areal unit data, with inference in a
		Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian, or
		Poisson, but for some models only the binomial and Poisson data
		likelihoods are available. The spatio-temporal autocorrelation
		is modelled by  random effects, which are assigned conditional
		autoregressive (CAR) style prior distributions. A number of
		different random effects structures are available, including
		Bernardinelli et al. (1995) doi:10.1002/sim.4780142112,
		Rushworth et al. (2014) doi:10.1016/j.sste.2014.05.001 and Lee
		et al. (2016) doi:10.1214/16-AOAS941. Full details are given in
		the vignette accompanying this package. The creation of this
		package was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences
		Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1 and the Medical
		Research Council (MRC) grant MR/L022184/1.
