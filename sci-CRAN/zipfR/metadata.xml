		Statistical models for word frequency distributions //
		Statistical models and utilities for the analysis of word
		frequency distributions.  The utilities include functions for
		loading, manipulating and visualizing word frequency data and
		vocabulary growth curves.  The package also implements several
		statistical models for the distribution of word frequencies in
		a population.  (The name of this library derives from the most
		famous word frequency distribution, Zipf's law.)
