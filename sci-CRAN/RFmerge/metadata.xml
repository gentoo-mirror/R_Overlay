		Merging of Satellite Datasets with Ground Observations using
		Random Forests // S3 implementation of the Random Forest
		MErging Procedure (RF-MEP), which combines two or more
		satellite-based datasets (e.g., precipitation products,
		topography) with ground observations to produce a new dataset
		with improved spatio-temporal distribution of the target field.
		In particular, this package was developed to merge different
		Satellite-based Rainfall Estimates (SREs) with measurements
		from rain gauges, in order to obtain a new precipitation
		dataset where the time series in the rain gauges are used to
		correct different types of errors present in the SREs. However,
		this package might be used to merge other
		hydrological/environmental satellite fields with point
		observations. For details, see Baez-Villanueva et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1016/j.rse.2019.111606. Bugs / comments / questions /
		collaboration of any kind are very welcomed.
