		Lightweight Reproducible Reporting // Order, create and store
		reports from R.  By defining a lightweight interface around the
		inputs and outputs of an analysis, a lot of the repetitive work
		for reproducible research can be automated.  We define a simple
		format for organising and describing work that facilitates
		collaborative reproducible research and acknowledges that all
		analyses are run multiple times over their lifespans.
