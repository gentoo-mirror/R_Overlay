		Fast Robust Moments // Fast, numerically robust computation of
		weighted moments via 'Rcpp'. Supports computation on vectors
		and matrices, and Monoidal append of moments. Moments and
		cumulants over running fixed length windows can be computed, as
		well as over time-based windows. Moment computations are via a
		generalization of Welford's method, as described by Bennett et.
