		Minimal Implementation of Functional Lenses // Provides utilities
		to create and use lenses to simplify data manipulation. Lenses
		are composable getter/setter pairs that provide a functional
		approach to manipulating deeply nested data structures, e.g.,
		elements within list columns in data frames. The implementation
		is based on the earlier 'lenses' R package
		https://github.com/cfhammill/lenses, which was inspired by the
		Haskell 'lens' package by Kmett (2012)
		https://github.com/ekmett/lens, one of the most widely
		referenced implementations of lenses. For additional background
		and history on the theory of lenses, see the 'lens' package
		wiki: https://github.com/ekmett/lens/wiki/History-of-Lenses.
