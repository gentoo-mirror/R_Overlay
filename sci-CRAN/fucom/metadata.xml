		Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) // Full Consistency Method
		(FUCOM) for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), developed by
		Dragam Pamucar in 2018 (doi:10.3390/sym10090393). The goal of
		the method is to determine the weights of criteria such that
		the deviation from full consistency is minimized. Users provide
		a character vector specifying the ranking of each criterion
		according to its significance, starting from the criterion
		expected to have the highest weight to the least significant
		one. Additionally, users provide a numeric vector specifying
		the priority values for each criterion. The comparison is made
		with respect to the first-ranked (most significant) criterion.
		The function returns the optimized weights for each criterion
		(summing to 1), the comparative priority (Phi) values, the
		mathematical transitivity condition (w) value, and the minimum
		deviation from full consistency (DFC).
