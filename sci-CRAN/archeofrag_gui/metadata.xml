		Spatial Analysis in Archaeology from Refitting Fragments (GUI) //
		A 'Shiny' application to access the functionalities and
		datasets of the 'archeofrag' package for spatial analysis in
		archaeology from refitting data. Quick and seamless exploration
		of archaeological refitting datasets, focusing on physical
		refits only. Features include: built-in documentation and
		convenient workflow, plot generation and exports, support of
		parallel computing when simulating archaeological site
		formation processes, R code generation to re-execute
		simulations and ensure reproducibility, code generation for the
