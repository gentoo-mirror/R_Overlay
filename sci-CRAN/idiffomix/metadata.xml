		Integrated Differential Analysis of Multi Omics Data using a
		Joint Mixture Model // A joint mixture model has been developed
		by Majumdar et al. (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.17511 that
		integrates information from gene expression data and
		methylation data at the modelling stage to capture their
		inherent dependency structure, enabling simultaneous
		identification of differentially methylated cytosine-guanine
		dinucleotide (CpG) sites and differentially expressed genes.
		The model leverages a joint likelihood function that accounts
		for the nested structure in the data, with parameter estimation
		performed using an expectation-maximisation algorithm.
