		Tools for Principal Component Analysis-Based Data Structure
		Comparisons // A suite of non-parametric, visual tools for
		assessing differences in data structures for two datasets that
		contain different observations of the same variables. These
		tools are all based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
		thus effectively address differences in the structures of the
		covariance matrices of the two datasets. The PCASDC tools
		consist of easy-to-use, intuitive plots that each focus on
		different aspects of the PCA decompositions. The cumulative
		eigenvalue (CE) plot describes differences in the variance
		components (eigenvalues) of the deconstructed covariance
		matrices. The angle plot presents the information loss when
		moving from the PCA decomposition of one dataset to the PCA
		decomposition of the other. The chroma plot describes the
		loading patterns of the two datasets, thereby presenting the
		relative weighting and importance of the variables from the
		original dataset.
