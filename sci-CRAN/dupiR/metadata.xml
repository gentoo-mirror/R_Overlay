		Bayesian Inference from Count Data using Discrete Uniform Priors
		// We consider a set of sample counts obtained by sampling
		arbitrary fractions of a finite volume containing an
		homogeneously dispersed population of identical objects. This
		package implements a Bayesian derivation of the posterior
		probability distribution of the population size using a
		binomial likelihood and non-conjugate, discrete uniform priors
		under sampling with or without replacement. This can be used
		for a variety of statistical problems involving absolute
		quantification under uncertainty. See Comoglio et al. (2013)
