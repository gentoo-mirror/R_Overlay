		Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox // A set of tools for
		model-based optimization and tuning of algorithms
		(hyperparameter tuning respectively hyperparameter
		optimization). It includes surrogate models, optimizers, and
		design of experiment approaches. The main interface is spot,
		which uses sequentially updated surrogate models for the
		purpose of efficient optimization. The main goal is to ease the
		burden of objective function evaluations, when a single
		evaluation requires a significant amount of resources.
