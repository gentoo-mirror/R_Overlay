		Bayesian Inference of Binary, Count and Continuous Data in
		Toxicology // Advanced methods for a valuable quantitative
		environmental risk assessment using Bayesian inference of
		several type of toxicological data. 'binary' (e.g., survival,
		mobility), 'count' (e.g., reproduction) and 'continuous' (e.g.,
		growth as length, weight).  Estimation procedures can be used
		without a deep knowledge of their underlying probabilistic
		model or inference methods. Rather, they were designed to
		behave as well as possible without requiring a user to provide
		values for some obscure parameters. That said, models can also
		be used as a first step to tailor new models for more specific
		situations.
