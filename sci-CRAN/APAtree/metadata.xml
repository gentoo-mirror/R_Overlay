		Computation of the 'Area Potentially Available' (APA) to Trees //
		Maps of the 'area potentially available' (APA) of trees is
		calculated from mapped forest stands using the approach from
		Gspaltl et al. (2012) doi:10.1093/forestry/cps052. This is done
		by computing a rasterized version of 'weighted voronoi
		diagrams' using a an approximation of the trees competitive
		ability (e.g., crown radius, leaf area) as weight. The main
		output are 'Raster*'- objects from the 'raster' package that
		are stored together with the raw data in apa_list's, the main
		class of the 'APAtree' package. Aggregation functions are
		provided to calculate stand characteristics based on APA-maps
		such as relative proportions according to APA-size and the
		neighborhood diversity index NDiv (Glatthorn (2021)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108073).
