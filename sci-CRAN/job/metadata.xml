		Run Code as an RStudio Job - Free Your Console // Call
		job::job({code here}) to run R code as an RStudio job and keep
		your console free in the meantime. This allows for a productive
		workflow while testing (multiple) long-running chunks of code.
		It can also be used to organize results using the RStudio Jobs
		GUI or to test code in a clean environment. Two RStudio Addins
		can be used to run selected code as a job.
