		Network-Adjusted Covariates for Community Detection //
		Incorporating node-level covariates for community detection has
		gained increasing attention these years. This package provides
		the function for implementing the novel community detection
		algorithm known as Network-Adjusted Covariates for Community
		Detection (NAC), which is designed to detect latent community
		structure in graphs with node-level information, i.e.,
		covariates. This algorithm can handle models such as the
		degree-corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM) with
		covariates. NAC specifically addresses the discrepancy between
		the community structure inferred from the adjacency information
		and the community structure inferred from the covariates
		information. For more detailed information, please refer to the
		reference paper: Yaofang Hu and Wanjie Wang (2023)
		arXiv:2306.15616. In addition to NAC, this package includes
		several other existing community detection algorithms that are
		compared to NAC in the reference paper. These algorithms are
		Spectral Clustering On Ratios-of Eigenvectors (SCORE), network-
		based regularized spectral clustering (Net-based), covariate-
		based spectral clustering (Cov-based), covariate-assisted
		spectral clustering (CAclustering) and semidefinite programming
		(SDP).
