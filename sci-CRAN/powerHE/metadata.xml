		Power and Sample Size Calculations with Hierarchical Endpoints //
		Calculate sample size or power for hierarchical endpoints. The
		package can handle any type of outcomes (binary, continuous,
		count, ordinal, time-to-event) and any number of such
		endpoints. It allows users to calculate sample size with a
		given power or to calculate power with a given sample size for
		hypothesis testing based on win ratios, win odds, net benefit,
		or DOOR (desirability of outcome ranking) as treatment effect
		between two groups for hierarchical endpoints. The methods of
		this package are described further in the paper by Barnhart, H.
		X. et al. (2024, doi:10.1080/19466315.2024.2365629).
