		A Lightweight, Flexible, and Fast Data Validation Package that
		Can Handle All Sizes of Data // Allows you to define rules
		which can be used to verify a given dataset. The package acts
		as a thin wrapper around more powerful data packages such as
		'dplyr', 'data.table', 'arrow', and 'DBI' ('SQL'), which do the
		heavy lifting.
