		Separable Gaussian Process Interpolation (Emulation) // Functions
		to build and use an interpolator ("emulator") for time series
		or 1D regularly spaced data in multidimensional space. The
		standard usage is for interpolating time-resolved computer
		model output between model parameter settings. It can also be
		used for interpolating multivariate data (e.g., oceanographic
		time-series data, etc.) in space.  There are functions to test
		the emulator using cross-validation, and to produce contour
		plots over 2D slices in model input parameter (or physical)
		space.
