		Design-Based Causal Inference Method for Incomplete Block Designs
		// This R package implements methods for estimation and
		inference under Incomplete Block Designs and Balanced
		Incomplete Block Designs within a design-based finite-
		population framework. Based on 'Koo and Pashley' (2024)
		arXiv:2405.19312, it includes block-level estimators and
		extends to unit-level effects using 'Horvitz-Thompson' and
		'Hjek' estimators. The package also provides asymptotic
		confidence intervals to support valid statistical inference.
