		Simple Presentation of Estimated Exponential Semi-Variograms //
		User friendly interface based on the R package 'gstat' to fit
		exponential parametric models to empirical semi-variograms in
		order to model the spatial correlation structure of health
		data. Geo-located health outcomes of survey participants may be
		used to model spatial effects on health in an ego-centred
		approach.  The package contains a range of functions to help
		explore the spatial structure of the data as well as visualize
		the fit of exponential models for various metaparameter
		combinations with respect to the number of lag intervals and
		maximal distance.  Furthermore, the outcome of interest can be
		adjusted for covariates by fitting a linear regression in a
		preliminary step before the semi-variogram fitting process.
