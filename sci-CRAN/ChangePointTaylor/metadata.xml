		Identify Changes in Mean // A basic implementation of the change
		in mean detection method outlined in: Taylor, Wayne A. (2000)
		https://variation.com/wp-content/uploads/change-point-
		analyzer/change-point-analysis-a-powerful-new-tool-for-
		detecting-changes.pdf. The package recursively uses the mean-
		squared error change point calculation to identify candidate
		change points. The candidate change points are then re-
		estimated and Taylor's backwards elimination process is then
		employed to come up with a final set of change points. Many of
		the underlying functions are written in C++ for improved
		performance.
