		Deterministic Verbal Autopsy Coding with Expert Algorithm Verbal
		Autopsy // Expert Algorithm Verbal Autopsy assigns causes of
		death to 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire data. odk2EAVA()
		converts data to a standard input format for cause of death
		determination building on the work of Thomas (2021)
		https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/CrossVA/.
		codEAVA() uses the presence and absence of signs and symptoms
		reported in the Verbal Autopsy interview to diagnose common
		causes of death. A deterministic algorithm assigns a single
		cause of death to each Verbal Autopsy interview record using a
		hierarchy of all common causes for neonates or children 1 to 59
		months of age.
