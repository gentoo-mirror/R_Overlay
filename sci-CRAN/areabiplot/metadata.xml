		Area Biplot // Considering an (n x m) data matrix X, this package
		is based on the method proposed by Gower, Groener, and Velden
		(2010) doi:10.1198/jcgs.2010.07134, and utilize the  resulting
		matrices from the extended version of the NIPALS decomposition
		to determine n triangles whose areas are used  to  visually
		estimate the elements of a specific column of X. After a
		90-degree rotation of the sample points, the triangles are
		drawn regarding the following points: 1.the origin of the axes;
		2.the sample points; 3. the vector endpoint representing some
		variable.
