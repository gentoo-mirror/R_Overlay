		Generalized Linear Models with Truncated Lasso Penalty //
		Extremely efficient procedures for fitting regularization path
		with l0, l1, and truncated lasso penalty for linear regression
		and logistic regression models. This version is a completely
		new version compared with our previous version, which was
		mainly based on R. New core algorithms are developed and are
		now written in C++ and highly optimized.
