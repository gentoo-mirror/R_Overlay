		Truncated Lasso Regularized Generalized Linear Models // It
		provides an extremely efficient procedure for fitting the
		entire truncated lasso regularization path for linear
		regression, logistic and multinomial regression models, Poisson
		regression and the Cox model. The algorithm uses the difference
		of convex technique. The detail of the algorithm is described
		in Shen, Pan and Zhu (2012) doi:10.1080/01621459.2011.645783.
		The package is inherited from a popular R package 'glmnet' and
		many functions in 'glmnet' can be directly used in 'glmtlp'.
		You can learn more details by the online manual
		(http://wuchong.org/glmtlp.html).
