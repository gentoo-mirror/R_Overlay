		Fast Compression and Serialization with 'Zstandard' Algorithm //
		Fast, compressed serialization of R objects using the
		'Zstandard' algorithm. R objects can be compressed and
		decompressed quickly using the standard serialization mechanism
		in R.   Raw byte vectors and strings are also handled directly
		for compatibility with compressed data created by other systems
		and programs supporting 'Zstandard' compression. Dictionaries
		are supported for more effective compression of small data, and
		functions are provided for training these dictionaries. This
		implementation is a wrapper around the 'Zstandard' 'C' library
		which is available from https://github.com/facebook/zstd.
