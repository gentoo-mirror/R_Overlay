		Leader Clustering Algorithm // The leader clustering algorithm
		provides a means for clustering a set of data points. Unlike
		many other clustering algorithms it does not require the user
		to specify the number of clusters, but instead requires the
		approximate radius of a cluster as its primary tuning
		parameter. The package provides a fast implementation of this
		algorithm in n-dimensions using Lp-distances (with special
		cases for p=1,2, and infinity) as well as for spatial data
		using the Haversine formula, which takes latitude/longitude
		pairs as inputs and clusters based on great circle distances.
