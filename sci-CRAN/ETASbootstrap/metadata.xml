		Bootstrap Confidence Interval Estimation for 'ETAS' Model
		Parameters // The 2-D spatial and temporal Epidemic Type
		Aftershock Sequence ('ETAS') Model is widely used to
		'decluster' earthquake data catalogs. Usually, the calculation
		of standard errors of the 'ETAS' model parameter estimates is
		based on the Hessian matrix derived from the log-likelihood
		function of the fitted model. However, when an 'ETAS' model is
		fitted to a local data set over a time period that is limited
		or short, the standard errors based on the Hessian matrix may
		be inaccurate. It follows that the asymptotic confidence
		intervals for parameters may not always be reliable. As an
		alternative, this package allows the building of bootstrap
		confidence intervals based on empirical quantiles for the
		parameters of the 2-D spatial and temporal 'ETAS' model.
