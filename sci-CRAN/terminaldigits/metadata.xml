		Tests of Uniformity and Independence for Terminal Digits //
		Implements simulated tests for the hypothesis that terminal
		digits are uniformly distributed (chi-squared goodness-of-fit)
		and the hypothesis that terminal digits are independent from
		preceding digits (several tests of independence for r x c
		contingency tables). Also, for a number of distributions,
		implements Monte Carlo simulations for type I errors and power
		for the test of independence.
