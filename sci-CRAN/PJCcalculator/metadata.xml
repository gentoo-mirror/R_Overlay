		PROs-Joint Contrast (PJC) Calculator // Computes the Patient-
		Reported Outcomes (PROs) Joint Contrast (PJC), a residual-based
		summary that captures information left over after accounting
		for the clinical Disease Activity index for Psoriatic Arthritis
		(cDAPSA). PROs (pain and patient global assessment) and joint
		counts (swollen and tender) are standardized, then each
		component is adjusted for standardized cDAPSA using natural
		spline coefficients that were derived from previously published
		models. The resulting residuals are standardized and combined
		using fixed principal component loadings, to yield a continuous
		PJC score and quartile groupings. This package provides a
		calculator for applying those published coefficients to new
		datasets; it does not itself estimate spline models or
		principal components.
