		Tensor Noise Reduction and Completion Based on Ordinal
		Observations // Efficient algorithm for tensor noise reduction
		and completion of ordinal tensor data based on the cumulative
		link model. The algorithm employs the alternating optimization
		approach. The detailed algorithm description can be found in
		Lee and Wang, Proceedings of International Conference on
		Machine Learning, 119:5778-5788, 2020.
