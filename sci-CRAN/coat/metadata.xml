		Conditional Method Agreement Trees (COAT) // Agreement of
		continuously scaled measurements made by two techniques,
		devices or methods is usually evaluated by the well-established
		Bland-Altman analysis or plot. Conditional method agreement
		trees (COAT), proposed by Karapetyan, Zeileis, Henriksen, and
		Hapfelmeier (2023) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2306.04456, embed the
		Bland-Altman analysis in the framework of recursive
		partitioning to explore heterogeneous method agreement in
		dependence of covariates. COAT can also be used to perform a
		Bland-Altman test for differences in method agreement.
