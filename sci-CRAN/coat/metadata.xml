		Conditional Method Agreement Trees (COAT) // Agreement of
		continuously scaled measurements made by two techniques,
		devices or methods is usually evaluated by the well-established
		Bland-Altman analysis or plot. Conditional method agreement
		trees (COAT), proposed by Karapetyan, Zeileis, Henriksen, and
		Hapfelmeier (2025) doi:10.1093/jrsssc/qlae077, embed the Bland-
		Altman analysis in the framework of recursive partitioning to
		explore heterogeneous method agreement in dependence of
		covariates. COAT can also be used to perform a Bland-Altman
		test for differences in method agreement.
