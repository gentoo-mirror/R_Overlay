		Methods in Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) System // Mahalanobis-Taguchi
		(MT) system is a collection of multivariate analysis methods
		developed for the field of quality engineering. MT system
		consists of two families depending on their purpose. One is a
		family of Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) methods (in the broad sense)
		for diagnosis (see Woodall, W. H., Koudelik, R., Tsui, K. L.,
		Kim, S. B., Stoumbos, Z. G., and Carvounis, C. P. (2003)
		doi:10.1198/004017002188618626) and the other is a family of
		Taguchi (T) methods for forecasting (see Kawada, H., and
		Nagata, Y. (2015) doi:10.17929/tqs.1.12). The MT package
		contains three basic methods for the family of MT methods and
		one basic method for the family of T methods. The MT method (in
		the narrow sense), the Mahalanobis-Taguchi Adjoint (MTA)
		methods, and the Recognition-Taguchi (RT) method are for the MT
		method and the two-sided Taguchi (T1) method is for the family
		of T methods. In addition, the Ta and Tb methods, which are the
		improved versions of the T1 method, are included.
