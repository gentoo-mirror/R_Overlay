		Differentially Private Regularized Logistic Regression //
		Implements two differentially private algorithms for estimating
		L2-regularized logistic regression coefficients. A randomized
		algorithm F is epsilon-differentially private (C. Dwork,
		Differential Privacy, ICALP 2006 DOI:10.1007/11681878_14), if
		|log(P(F(D) in S)) - log(P(F(D') in S))| = epsilon for any pair
		D, D' of datasets that differ in exactly one record, any
		measurable set S, and the randomness is taken over the choices
		F makes.
