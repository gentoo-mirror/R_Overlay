		High-Level Functions to Read and Write Ensemble Forecast Time
		Series in netCDF // The binary file format 'netCDF' is
		developed primarily for climate, ocean and meteorological data,
		and 'efts' is a package to read and write Ensemble Forecast
		Time Series data in 'netCDF'. 'netCDF' has traditionally been
		used to store time slices of gridded data, rather than complete
		time series of point data. 'efts' facilitates data handling
		stored in 'netCDF' files that follow a convention devised in
		the domain of ensemble hydrologic forecasting, but possibly
		applicable in other domains. 'efts' uses reference class
		objects to provide a high level interface to read and write
		such data, wrapping lower level operations performed using
		'ncdf4'.
