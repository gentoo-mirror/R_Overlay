		Shrinkage t Statistic and Correlation-Adjusted t-Score //
		Implements the "shrinkage t" statistic introduced in Opgen-
		Rhein and Strimmer (2007) and a shrinkage estimate of the
		"correlation-adjusted t-score" (CAT score) described in Zuber
		and Strimmer (2009).  It also offers a convenient interface to
		a number of other regularized t-statistics commonly employed in
		high-dimensional case-control studies.
