		Mixtures of Exponential-Distance Models with Covariates //
		Implements a model-based clustering method for categorical
		life-course sequences relying on mixtures of exponential-
		distance models introduced by Murphy et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1111/rssa.12712. A range of flexible precision parameter
		settings corresponding to weighted generalisations of the
		Hamming distance metric are considered, along with the
		potential inclusion of a noise component. Gating covariates can
		be supplied in order to relate sequences to baseline
		characteristics. Sampling weights are also accommodated. The
		models are fitted using the EM algorithm and tools for
		visualising the results are also provided.
