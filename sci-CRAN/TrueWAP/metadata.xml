		True Range-Weighted Average Price ('TrueWAP') // This
		groundbreaking technical indicator directly integrates
		volatility into price averaging by weighting median range-bound
		prices using the True Range.  Unlike conventional metrics such
		as TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price), which focuses solely on
		time, or VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price), which emphasizes
		volume, 'TrueWAP' captures fluctuating market behavior by
		reflecting true price movement within high/low performance
		boundaries.
