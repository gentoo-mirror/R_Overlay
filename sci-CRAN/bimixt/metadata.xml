		Estimates Mixture Models for Case-Control Data // Estimates non-
		Gaussian mixture models of case-control data. The four types of
		models supported are binormal, two component constrained, two
		component unconstrained, and four component.  The most general
		model is the four component model, under which both cases and
		controls are distributed according to a mixture of two unimodal
		distributions.  In the four component model, the two component
		distributions of the control mixture may be distinct from the
		two components of the case mixture distribution.  In the two
		component unconstrained model, the components of the control
		and case mixtures are the same; however the mixture
		probabilities may differ for cases and controls.  In the two
		component constrained model, all controls are distributed
		according to one of the two components while cases follow a
		mixture distribution of the two components.  In the binormal
		model, cases and controls are distributed according to distinct
		unimodal distributions.  These models assume that Box-Cox
		transformed case and control data with a common lambda
		parameter are distributed according to Gaussian mixture
		distributions.   Model parameters are estimated using the
		expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.  Likelihood ratio test
		comparison of nested models can be performed using the lr.test
		function. AUC and PAUC values can be computed for the model-
		based and empirical ROC curves using the auc and pauc
		functions, respectively. The model-based and empirical ROC
		curves can be graphed using the roc.plot function. Finally, the
		model-based density estimates can be visualized by plotting a
		model object created with the bimixt.model function.
