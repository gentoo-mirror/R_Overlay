		'WebDriver' Client for 'PhantomJS' // A client for the
		'WebDriver' 'API'. It allows driving a (probably headless) web
		browser, and can be used to test web applications, including
		'Shiny' apps. In theory it works with any 'WebDriver'
		implementation, but it was only tested with 'PhantomJS'.
