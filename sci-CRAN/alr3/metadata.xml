		files and a few functions used in the textbook S. Weisberg
		(2005), 'Applied Linear Regression,' 3rd edition, Wiley are
		presented. This package depends on the car package. Many
		functions formerly in alr3 have been renamed and now reside in
		car. Data files have been lightly modified to make some data
		columns row labels.  Many of these files are also in the newer
		alr4 package.
