		NHS Data Dictionary Toolset for NHS Lookups // Providing a common
		set of simplified web scraping tools for working with the NHS
		Data Dictionary
		https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_elements_overview.html. The
		intended usage is to access the data elements section of the
		NHS Data Dictionary to access key lookups. The benefits of
		having it in this package are that the lookups are the live
		lookups on the website and will not need to be maintained. This
		package was commissioned by the NHS-R community
		https://nhsrcommunity.com/ to provide this consistency of
		lookups. The OpenSafely lookups have now been added
		https://www.opencodelists.org/docs/.
