		General Network (HTTP/FTP/...) Client Interface for R // A
		wrapper for 'libcurl' https://curl.se/libcurl/ Provides
		functions to allow one to compose general HTTP requests and
		provides convenient functions to fetch URIs, get  post forms,
		etc. and process the results returned by the Web server. This
		provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP/...
		connection and the form of the request while providing a
		higher-level interface than is available just using R socket
		connections.  Additionally, the underlying implementation is
		robust and extensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and
		downloads), SSL/HTTPS, telnet, dict, ldap, and also supports
		cookies, redirects, authentication, etc.
