		Koeppen-Geiger Climatic Zones // Aids in identifying the Koeppen-
		Geiger (KG) climatic zone for a given location. The Koeppen-
		Geiger climate zones were first published in 1884, as a system
		to classify regions of the earth by their relative heat and
		humidity through the year, for the benefit of human health,
		plant and agriculture and other human activity [1]. This
		climate zone classification system, applicable to all of the
		earths surface, has continued to be developed by scientists up
		to the present day.  Recently one of use (FZ) has published
		updated, higher accuracy KG climate zone definitions [2]. In
		this package we use these updated high-resolution maps as the
		data source [3]. We provide functions that return the KG
		climate zone for a given longitude and lattitude, or for a
		given United States zip code. In addition the CZUncertainty()
		function will check climate zones nearby to check if the given
		location is near a climate zone boundary. In addition an
		interactive shiny app is provided to define the KG climate zone
		for a given longitude and lattitude, or United States zip code.
		Digital data, as well as animated maps, showing the shift of
		the climate zones are provided on the following website http
		://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at. This work was supported by the
		DOE-EERE SunShot award DE-EE-0007140. [1] W. Koeppen, (2011)
