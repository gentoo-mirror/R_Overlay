		R as a Plotting Engine // Generate basic charts either by custom
		applications, or from a small script launched from the system
		console, or within the R console. Two ASCII text files are
		necessary: (1) The graph parameters file, which name is passed
		to the function 'rplotengine()'. The user can specify the
		titles, choose the type of the graph, graph output formats
		(e.g. png, eps), proportion of the X-axis and Y-axis, position
		of the legend, whether to show or not a grid at the background,
		etc. (2) The data to be plotted, which name is specified as a
		parameter ('data_filename') in the previous file. This data
		file has a tabulated format, with a single character (e.g. tab)
		between each column. Optionally, the file could include data
		columns for showing confidence intervals.
