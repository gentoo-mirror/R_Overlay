		Cumulative History Analysis for Bistable Perception Time Series
		// Estimates cumulative history for time-series for
		continuously viewed bistable perceptual rivalry displays.
		Computes cumulative history via a homogeneous first order
		differential process. I.e., it assumes exponential growth/decay
		of the history as a function time and perceptually dominant
		state, Pastukhov  Braun (2011) doi:10.1167/11.10.12. Supports
		Gamma, log normal, and normal distribution families. Provides a
		method to compute history directly and example of using the
		computation on a custom Stan code.
