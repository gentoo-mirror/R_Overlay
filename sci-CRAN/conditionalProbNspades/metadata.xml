		Conditional Probabilities of Distributions Across Hearts Hands //
		Provides some tabulated data to be be referred to in a
		discussion in a vignette accompanying my upcoming R package
		'playWholeHandDriverPassParams'. In addition to that specific
		purpose, these may also provide data and illustrate some
		computational approaches that are relevant to card games like
		hearts or bridge.This package refers to authentic data from
		Gregory Stoll
		https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/bridge/math.html, and details
		of performing the probability calculations from Jeremy L.
		Martin https://jlmartin.ku.edu/~jlmartin/bridge/basics.pdf.
