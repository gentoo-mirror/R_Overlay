		Projection Pursuit Regression Tree Visualization // It was
		developed as a tool for exploring 'PPTreereg' (Projection
		Pursuit TREE of REGression). It uses various projection pursuit
		indexes and 'XAI' (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) methods
		to help understand the model by finding connections between the
		input variables and prediction values of the model. The
		'KernelSHAP' (Aas, Jullum and Lland (2019) arXiv:1903.10464)
		algorithm was modified to fit PPTreereg, and some codes were
		modified from the 'shapr' package (Sellereite, Nikolai, and
		Martin Jullum (2020) doi:10.21105/joss.02027). The implemented
		methods help to explore the model at the single instance level
		as well as at the whole dataset level. Users can compare with
		other machine learning models by applying it to the 'DALEX'
		package of 'R'.
