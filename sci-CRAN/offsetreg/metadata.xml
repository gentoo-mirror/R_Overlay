		An Extension of 'Tidymodels' Supporting Offset Terms // Extend
		the 'tidymodels' ecosystem https://www.tidymodels.org/ to
		enable the creation of predictive models with offset terms.
		Models with offsets are most useful when working with count
		data or when fitting an adjustment model on top of an existing
		model with a prior expectation. The former situation is common
		in insurance where data is often weighted by exposures. The
		latter is common in life insurance where industry mortality
		tables are often used as a starting point for setting
		assumptions.
