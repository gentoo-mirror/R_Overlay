		An Interface to the GUDHI Library for Topological Data Analysis
		// Provides an interface to the GUDHI library which is a
		generic open source C++ library, with a Python interface, for
		topological data analysis (TDA) and higher dimensional geometry
		understanding. The library offers state-of-the-art data
		structures and algorithms to construct simplicial complexes and
		compute persistent homology.
