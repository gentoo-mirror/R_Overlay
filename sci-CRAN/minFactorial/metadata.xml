		All Possible Minimally Changed Factorial Run Orders // In many
		agricultural, engineering, industrial, post-harvest and
		processing experiments, the number of factor level changes and
		hence the total number of changes is of serious concern as such
		experiments may consists of hard-to-change factors where it is
		physically very difficult to change levels of some factors or
		sometime such experiments may require normalization time to
		obtain adequate operating condition. For this reason, run
		orders that offer the minimum  number of factor level changes
		and at the same time minimize the possible influence of
		systematic trend effects on the experimentation have been
		sought. Factorial designs with minimum changes in factors level
		may be preferred for such situations as these minimally changed
		run orders will minimize the cost of the experiments. For
		method details see, Bhowmik, A.,Varghese, E., Jaggi, S. and
		Varghese, C. (2017)doi:10.1080/03610926.2016.1152490.This
		package used to construct all possible minimally changed
		factorial run orders for different experimental set ups along
		with different statistical criteria to measure the performance
		of these designs. It consist of the function minFactDesign().
