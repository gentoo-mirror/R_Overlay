		Fit Latent Dirichlet Allocation Models using Stochastic
		Variational Inference // Fits Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic
		models to text data using the stochastic variational inference
		algorithm described in Hoffman et. al. (2013)
		arXiv:1206.7051v3. This method is more efficient than the
		original batch variational inference algorithm for LDA, and
		allows users to fit LDA models with more topics and to larger
		text corpora than would be feasible using that older method.
