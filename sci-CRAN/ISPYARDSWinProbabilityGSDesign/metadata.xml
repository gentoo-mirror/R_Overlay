		Trial Design in Respiratory Disease Based on the Win Probability
		// Provides analysis results and trial simulation functions for
		the I-SPY Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome trial based on
		composite ranked outcomes. The composite ranked outcome is a
		hierarchical outcome where trial participants are ranked first
		by 28 day mortality, then ventilator days, then by advanced
		respiratory support days. A Bayesian win probability approach
		is used for analysis. Trial design options include group
		sequential looks for safety, superiority, futility, and
		adjustment of randomization probabilities.
