		R Client for the 'ChEA3' Transcription Factor Enrichment API //
		Interface to the 'ChEA3' transcription factor enrichment API.
		'ChEA3' integrates evidence from ChIP-seq, co-expression, and
		literature resources to prioritize transcription factors
		regulating a given set of genes. This package provides
		convenient R functions to query the API, retrieve ranked
		results across collections (including integrated scores), and
		standardize output for downstream analysis in R/Bioconductor
		workflows. See https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/ or Keenan (2019)
		doi:10.1093/nar/gkz446 for further details.
