		Normalize  Denoise Droplet Single Cell Protein Data (CITE-seq) //
		This lightweight R package provides a method for normalizing
		and denoising protein expression data from droplet based single
		cell experiments. Raw protein Unique Molecular Index (UMI)
		counts from sequencing DNA-conjugated antibodies in droplets
		(e.g. 'CITE-seq') have substantial measurement noise. Our
		experiments and computational modeling revealed two major
		components of this noise: 1) protein-specific noise originating
		from ambient, unbound antibody encapsulated in droplets that
		can be accurately inferred via the expected protein counts
		detected in empty droplets, and 2) droplet/cell-specific noise
		revealed via the shared variance component associated with
		isotype antibody controls and background protein counts in each
		cell. This package normalizes and removes both of these sources
		of noise from raw protein data derived from methods such as
		'CITE-seq', 'REAP-seq', and data from the Mission Bio
		'Tapestri' platform. See the vignette for tutorials on how to
		integrate dsb with 'Seurat', 'Bioconductor' and the AnnData
		class in 'Python'. Please also see our preprint Mul M.P.,
		Martins A.J., and Tsang J.S. (2020)
		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.963603v1 for
		more details on the dsb method.
