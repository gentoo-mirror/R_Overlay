		Variables Clustering // Performs clustering of quantitative
		variables, assuming that clusters lie in low-dimensional
		subspaces. Segmentation of variables, number of clusters and
		their dimensions are selected based on BIC. Candidate models
		are identified based on many runs of K-means algorithm with
		different random initializations of cluster centers.
