		Constructing Joint Distributions with Control Over Statistical
		Properties // Synthesizing joint distributions from marginal
		densities, focusing on controlling key statistical properties
		such as correlation for continuous data, mutual information for
		categorical data, and inducing Simpson's Paradox. Generate
		datasets with specified correlation structures for continuous
		variables, adjust mutual information between categorical
		variables, and manipulate subgroup correlations to
		intentionally create Simpson's Paradox. Joe (1997)
