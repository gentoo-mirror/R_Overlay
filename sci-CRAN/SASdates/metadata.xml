		Convert the Dates to 'SAS' Formats // Converts the dates to
		different 'SAS' date formats. In 'SAS' dates are a special case
		of numeric values. Each day is assigned a specific numeric
		value, starting from January 1, 1960. This date is assigned the
		date value 0, and the next date has a date value of 1 and so
		on. The previous days to this date are represented by -1 , -2
		and so on. With this approach, 'SAS' can represent any date in
		the future or any date in the past. There are many date formats
		used in 'SAS' to represent date-time. Here, we try to develop
		functions which will convert the date to different 'SAS' date
		formats.
