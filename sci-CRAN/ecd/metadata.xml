		Elliptic Lambda Distribution and Option Pricing Model // Elliptic
		lambda distribution and lambda option pricing model have been
		evolved into a framework of stable-law inspired distributions,
		such as the extended stable lambda distribution for asset
		return, stable count distribution for volatility, and Lihn-
		Laplace process as a leptokurtic extension of Wiener process.
		This package contains functions for the computation of density,
		probability, quantile, random variable, fitting procedures,
		option prices, volatility smile. It also comes with sample
		financial data, and plotting routines.
