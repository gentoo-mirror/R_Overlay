		Tools for Visualizing Gaussian Mixture Models // The main
		function, plot_GMM, is used for plotting output from Gaussian
		mixture models, including both densities and overlaying mixture
		weight component curves from the fit GMM. The package includes
		another function, plot_mix_comps, which is used in the plot_GMM
		function, and can be used in any plot generated by the user for
		overlaying mixture component curves from Gaussian mixture
		models. For the plot_mix_comps function, usage most often will
		be specifying the "fun" argument within "stat_function" in a
		ggplot2 object.
