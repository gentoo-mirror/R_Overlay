		Tools for Visualizing Gaussian Mixture Models // The main
		function, plot_GMM, is used for plotting output from Gaussian
		mixture models (GMMs), including both densities and overlaying
		mixture weight component curves from the fit GMM. The package
		also include the function, plot_cut_point, which plots the
		cutpoint (mu) from the GMM over a histogram of the distribution
		with several color options. Finally, the package includes the
		function, plot_mix_comps, which is used in the plot_GMM
		function, and can be used to create a custom plot for
		overlaying mixture component curves from GMMs. For the
		plot_mix_comps function, usage most often will be specifying
		the "fun" argument within "stat_function" in a ggplot2 object.
