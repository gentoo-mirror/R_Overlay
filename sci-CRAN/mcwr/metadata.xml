		Markov Chains with Rewards // In the context of multistate
		models, which are popular in sociology, demography, and
		epidemiology, Markov chain with rewards calculations can help
		to refine transition timings and so obtain more accurate
		estimates. The package code accommodates up to nine transient
		states and irregular age (time) intervals. Traditional
		demographic life tables result as a special case. Formulas and
		methods involved are explained in detail in the accompanying
		article: Schneider / Myrskyla / van Raalte (2021): Flexible
		Transition Timing in Discrete-Time Multistate Life Tables Using
		Markov Chains with Rewards, MPIDR Working Paper WP-2021-002.
