		A 'shiny' App to Evaluate Diagnostic Tests Performance //
		Evaluate diagnostic test performance using data from laboratory
		or diagnostic research. It supports both binary and continuous
		test variables. It allows users to compute key performance
		indicators and visualize Receiver Operating Characteristic
		(ROC) curves, determine optimal cut-off thresholds, display
		confusion matrix, and export publication-ready plot. It aims to
		facilitate the application of statistical methods in diagnostic
		test evaluation by healthcare professionals. The methodology
		used to compute the performance indicators follows the overview
		described by Habibzadeh (2025) doi:10.11613/BM.2025.010101.
		Thanks to 'shiny' package.
