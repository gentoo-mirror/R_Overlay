		Combine Statistical Models into a Tibble for Comparison //
		Statisticians often want to compare the fit of different models
		on the same data set. However, this usually involves a lot of
		manual code to fish items out of summary() or plain model
		objects. 'modelfactory' offers the capability to pass multiple
		models in and get out metrics or coefficients for quick
		comparison with easy-to-remember syntax.
