		A User-Guided Bayesian Framework for Ensemble Feature Selection
		// The framework proposed in Jenul et al., (2022)
		doi:10.1007/s10994-022-06221-9, together with an interactive
		Shiny dashboard. 'UBayFS' is an ensemble feature selection
		technique embedded in a Bayesian statistical framework. The
		method combines data and user knowledge, where the first is
		extracted via data-driven ensemble feature selection. The user
		can control the feature selection by assigning prior weights to
		features and penalizing specific feature combinations. 'UBayFS'
		can be used for common feature selection as well as block
		feature selection.
