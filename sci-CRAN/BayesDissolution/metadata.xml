		Bayesian Models for Dissolution Testing // Fits Bayesian models
		(amongst others) to dissolution data sets that can be used for
		dissolution testing. The package was originally constructed to
		include only the Bayesian models outlined in Pourmohamad et al.
		(2022) doi:10.1111/rssc.12535. However, additional Bayesian and
		non-Bayesian models (based on bootstrapping and generalized
		pivotal quanties) have also been added. More models may be
		added over time.
