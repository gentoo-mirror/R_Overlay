		Create Scatter Plots with Marginal Density or Box Plots // Allows
		you to make clean, good-looking scatter plots with the option
		to easily add marginal density or box plots on the axes. It is
		also available as a module for 'jamovi' (see
		https://www.jamovi.org for more information). 'Scatr' is based
		on the 'cowplot' package by Claus O. Wilke and the 'ggplot2'
		package by Hadley Wickham.
