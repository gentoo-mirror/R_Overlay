		Simulation of Demic Diffusion with Environmental Constraints //
		Simulates demic diffusion building on models previously
		developed for the expansion of Neolithic and other food-
		producing economies during the Holocene (Fort et al. (2012)
		doi:10.7183/0002-7316.77.2.203, Souza et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1098/rsif.2021.0499). Growth and emigration are modelled
		as density-dependent processes using logistic growth and an
		asymptotic threshold model. Environmental and terrain layers,
		which can change over time, affect carrying capacity, growth
		and mobility. Multiple centres of origin with their respective
		starting times can be specified.
