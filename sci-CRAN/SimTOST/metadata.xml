		Sample Size Estimation for Bio-Equivalence Trials Through
		Simulation // Sample size estimation for bio-equivalence trials
		is supported through a simulation-based approach that extends
		the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure. The methodology
		provides flexibility in hypothesis testing, accommodates
		multiple treatment comparisons, and accounts for correlated
		endpoints. Users can model complex trial scenarios, including
		parallel and crossover designs, intra-subject variability, and
		different equivalence margins. Monte Carlo simulations enable
		accurate estimation of power and type I error rates, ensuring
		well-calibrated study designs. The statistical framework builds
		on established methods for equivalence testing and multiple
		hypothesis testing in bio-equivalence studies, as described in
		Schuirmann (1987) doi:10.1007/BF01068419, Mielke et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1080/19466315.2017.1371071, Shieh (2022)

		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-22005-5. Comprehensive documentation and
		vignettes guide users through implementation and interpretation
		of results.
