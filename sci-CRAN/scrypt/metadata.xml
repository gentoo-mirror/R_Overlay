		Key Derivation Functions for R Based on Scrypt // Functions for
		working with the scrypt key derivation functions originally
		described by Colin Percival
		https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf and in Percival and
		Josefsson (2016) doi:10.17487/RFC7914. Scrypt is a password-
		based key derivation function created by Colin Percival. The
		algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to
		perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large
		amounts of memory.
