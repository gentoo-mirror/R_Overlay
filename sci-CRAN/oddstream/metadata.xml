		Outlier Detection in Data Streams // We proposes a framework that
		provides real time support for early detection of anomalous
		series within a large collection of streaming time series data.
		By definition, anomalies are rare in comparison to a system's
		typical behaviour. We define an anomaly as an observation that
		is very unlikely given the forecast distribution. The algorithm
		first forecasts a boundary for the system's typical behaviour
		using a representative sample of the typical behaviour of the
		system. An approach based on extreme value theory is used for
		this boundary prediction process. Then a sliding window is used
		to test for anomalous series within the newly arrived
		collection of series. Feature based representation of time
		series is used as the input to the model. To cope with concept
		drift, the forecast boundary for the system's typical behaviour
		is updated periodically.  More details regarding the algorithm
		can be found in Talagala, P. D., Hyndman, R. J., Smith-Miles,
		K., et al. (2019) doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1617160.
