		Asymptotic Efficient Closed-Form Estimators for Multivariate
		Distributions // Asymptotic efficient closed-form estimators
		(MLEces) are provided in this package for three multivariate
		distributions(gamma, Weibull and Dirichlet) whose maximum
		likelihood estimators (MLEs) are not in closed forms. Closed-
		form estimators are strong consistent, and have the similar
		asymptotic normal distribution like MLEs. But the calculation
		of MLEces are much faster than the corresponding MLEs. Further
		details and explanations of MLEces can be found in. Jang, et
