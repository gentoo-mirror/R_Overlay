		Create Datasets with Identical Summary Statistics // Anscombe's
		quartet are a set of four two-variable datasets that have
		several common summary statistics but which have very different
		joint distributions.  This becomes apparent when the data are
		plotted, which illustrates the importance of using graphical
		displays in Statistics.  This package enables the creation of
		datasets that have identical marginal sample means and sample
		variances, sample correlation, least squares regression
		coefficients and coefficient of determination.  The user
		supplies an initial dataset, which is shifted, scaled and
		rotated in order to achieve target summary statistics.  The
		general shape of the initial dataset is retained. The target
		statistics can be supplied directly or calculated based on a
		user-supplied dataset.  The 'datasauRus' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=datasauRus provides further
		examples of datasets that have markedly different scatter plots
		but share many sample summary statistics.
