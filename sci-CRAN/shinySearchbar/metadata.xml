		Shiny Searchbar - An Input Widget for Highlighting Text and More
		// Add a searchbar widget to your 'Shiny' application. The
		widget quickly integrates with any existing element containing
		text to highlight matches. Highlighting is done with the
		'JavaScript' library 'mark.js'. The widget includes buttons to
		cycle through multiple instances of the match and automatically
		scroll to the matches in an overflow element (or window). The
		widget also displays the total number of matches and which
		match is currently being cycled through. The widget is
		structured as a 'Bootstrap 3' input group.
