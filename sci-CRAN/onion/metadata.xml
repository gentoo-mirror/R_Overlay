		Octonions and Quaternions // Quaternions and Octonions are four-
		and eight- dimensional extensions of the complex numbers.  They
		are normed division algebras over the real numbers and find
		applications in spatial rotations (quaternions) and string
		theory and relativity (octonions).  The quaternions are
		noncommutative and the octonions nonassociative.  See RKS
		Hankin 2006, Rnews Volume 6/2: 49-51, and the package vignette,
		for more details.
