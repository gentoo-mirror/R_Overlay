		Enhanced Tipping Point Displays the Results of Sensitivity
		Analysis for Missing Data // Using the idea of "tipping point"
		(proposed in Gregory Campbell, Gene Pennello and Lilly
		Yue(2011) DOI:10.1080/10543406.2011.550094) to visualize  the
		results of sensitivity analysis for missing data, the package
		provides a set of functions to list out all the possible
		combinations of missing values in two treatment arms, calculate
		corresponding estimated treatment effects and p values, and
		draw a colored heat-map. It could deal with randomized
		experiments with a binary outcome or a continuous outcome. In
		addition, the package provides a visualized method to compare
		various imputation methods by adding the rectangles or convex
		hulls on the basic plot.
