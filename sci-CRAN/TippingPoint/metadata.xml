		Enhanced Tipping Point Displays the Results of Sensitivity
		Analyses for Missing Data // Using the idea of "tipping point"
		(proposed in Gregory Campbell, Gene Pennello and Lilly
		Yue(2011) DOI:10.1080/10543406.2011.550094) to visualize  the
		results of sensitivity analysis for missing data, the package
		provides a set of functions to list out all the possible
		combinations of the values of missing data in two treatment
		arms, calculate corresponding estimated treatment effects and p
		values and draw a colored heat-map to visualize them. It could
		deal with randomized experiments with a binary outcome or a
		continuous outcome. In addition, the package provides a
		visualized method to compare various imputation methods by
		adding the rectangles or convex hulls on the basic plot.
