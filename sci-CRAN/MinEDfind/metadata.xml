		A Bayesian Design for Minimum Effective Dosing-Finding Trial //
		The nonparametric two-stage Bayesian adaptive design is a novel
		phase II clinical trial design for finding the minimum
		effective dose (MinED). This design is motivated by the top
		priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new drug,
		which is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance
		of exposing them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. It is
		used to design single-agent trials.
