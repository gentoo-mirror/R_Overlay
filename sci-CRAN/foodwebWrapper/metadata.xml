		Enhanced Wrapper to Show Which Functions Call What // Enhances
		the functionality of the mvbutils::foodweb() program. The
		matrix-format output of the original program contains identical
		row names and column names, each name representing a retrieved
		function. This format is enhanced by using the find_funs()
		program [see Sebastian (2017)
		https://sebastiansauer.github.io/finds_funs/] to concatenate
		the package name to the function name. Each package is assigned
		a unique color, that is used to color code the text naming the
		packages and the functions. This color coding is extended to
		the entries of value "1" within the matrix, indicating the
		pattern of ancestor and descendent functions.
