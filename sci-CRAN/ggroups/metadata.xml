		Pedigree and Genetic Groups // Calculates additive and dominance
		genetic relationship matrices and their inverses, in matrix and
		tabular-sparse formats. It includes functions for checking and
		processing pedigree, as well as functions to calculate the
		matrix of genetic group contributions (Q), and adding those
		contributions to the genetic merit of animals (Quaas (1988)
		doi:10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(88)79691-5). Calculation of Q is
		computationally extensive. There are computationally optimized
		functions to calculate Q.
