		Pedigree and Genetic Groups // Calculates additive and dominance
		genetic relationship matrices and their inverses, in matrix and
		tabular-sparse formats. It includes functions for checking and
		processing pedigree, calculating inbreeding coefficients
		(Meuwissen  Luo, 1992 doi:10.1186/1297-9686-24-4-305), as well
		as functions to calculate the matrix of genetic group
		contributions (Q), and adding those contributions to the
		genetic merit of animals (Quaas (1988)
		doi:10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(88)79691-5). Calculation of Q is
		computationally extensive. There are computationally optimized
		functions to calculate Q.
