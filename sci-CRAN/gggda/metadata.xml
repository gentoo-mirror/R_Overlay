		A 'ggplot2' Extension for Geometric Data Analysis // A variety of
		multivariable data summary statistics and constructions have
		been proposed, either to generalize univariable analogs or to
		exploit multivariable properties. Notable among these are the
		bivariate peelings surveyed by Green (1981,
		ISBN:978-0-471-28039-2), the bag-and-bolster plots proposed by
		Rousseeuw al (1999) doi:10.1080/00031305.1999.10474494, and the
		minimum spanning trees used by Jolliffe (2002)
		doi:10.1007/b98835 to represent high-dimensional relationships
		among data in a low-dimensional plot. Additionally, biplots of
		singular value--decomposed tabular data, such as from principal
		components analysis, make use of vectors, calibrated axes, and
		other representations of variable elements to complement point
		markers for case elements; see Gabriel (1971)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/58.3.453 and Gower  Harding (1988)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/75.3.445 for original proposals. Because
		they treat the abscissa and ordinate as commensurate or the
		data elements themselves as point masses or unit vectors, these
		multivariable tools can be thought of as belonging to geometric
		data analysis; see Podani (2000, ISBN:90-5782-067-6) for
		techniques and applications and Le Roux  Rouanet (2005)
		doi:10.1007/1-4020-2236-0 for foundations. 'gggda' extends
		Wickham's (2010) doi:10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098 layered grammar of
		graphics with statistical transformation ("stat") and geometric
		construction ("geom") layers for many of these tools, as well
		as convenience coordinate systems to emphasize intrinsic
		geometry of the data.
