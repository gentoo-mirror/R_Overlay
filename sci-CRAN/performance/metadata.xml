		Assessment of Regression Models Performance // Utilities for
		computing measures to assess model quality, which are not
		directly provided by R's 'base' or 'stats' packages. These
		include e.g. measures like r-squared, intraclass correlation
		coefficient (Nakagawa, Johnson  Schielzeth (2017)
		doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213), root mean squared error or
		functions to check models for overdispersion, singularity or
		zero-inflation and more. Functions apply to a large variety of
		regression models, including generalized linear models, mixed
		effects models and Bayesian models. References: Ldecke et al.
