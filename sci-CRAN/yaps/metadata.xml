		Track Estimation using YAPS (Yet Another Positioning Solver) //
		Estimate tracks of animals tagged with acoustic transmitters.
		'yaps' was introduced in 2017 as a transparent open-source tool
		to estimate positions of fish (and other aquatic animals)
		tagged with acoustic transmitters. Based on registrations of
		acoustic transmitters on hydrophones positioned in a fixed
		array, 'yaps' enables users to synchronize the collected data
		(i.e. correcting for drift in the internal clocks of the
		hydrophones/receivers) and subsequently to estimate tracks of
		the tagged animals. The paper introducing 'yaps' is available
		in open access at Baktoft, Gjelland, kland  Thygesen (2017)
		doi:10.1038/s41598-017-14278-z. Also check out our cookbook
		with a completely worked through example at Baktoft, Gjelland,
		kland, Rehage, Rodemann, Corujo, Viadero  Thygesen (2019)
		DOI:10.1101/2019.12.16.877688. Additional tutorials will
		eventually make their way onto the project website at
		https://baktoft.github.io/yaps/.
