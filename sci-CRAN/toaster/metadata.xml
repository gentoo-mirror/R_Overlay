		Big Data in-Database Analytics that Scales with Teradata Aster
		Distributed Platform // A consistent set of tools to perform
		in-database analytics on Teradata Aster Big Data Discovery
		Platform. toaster (a.k.a 'to Aster') embraces simple 2-step
		approach: compute in Aster - visualize and analyze in R. Its
		`compute` functions use combination of parallel SQL, SQL-MR and
		SQL-GR executing in Aster database - highly scalable parallel
		and distributed analytical platform. Then `create` functions
		visualize results with boxplots, scatterplots, histograms,
		heatmaps, word clouds, maps, networks, or slope graphs.
		Advanced options such as faceting, coloring, labeling, and
		others are supported with most visualizations.
