		Morphometrics using R // The goal of Momocs is to provide a
		complete, convenient, reproducible and open-source toolkit for
		2D morphometrics. It includes most common 2D morphometrics
		approaches on outlines, open outlines, configurations of
		landmarks, traditional morphometrics, and facilities for data
		preparation, manipulation and visualization with a consistent
		grammar throughout. It allows reproducible, complex
		morphometric analyses and other morphometrics approaches should
		be easy to plug in, or develop from, on top of this canvas.
