		Meta-Analysis for Detecting Genotype x Environment Associations
		// Provides functions to perform all steps of genome-wide
		association meta-analysis for studying Genotype x Environment
		interactions, from collecting the data to the manhattan plot.
		The procedure accounts for the potential correlation between
		studies. In addition to the Fixed and Random models, one can
		investigate the relationship between QTL effects and some
		qualitative or quantitative covariate via the test of contrast
		and the meta-regression, respectively.  The methodology is
		available from: (De Walsche, A., et al. (2025)
		\doi{10.1371/journal.pgen.1011553}).
