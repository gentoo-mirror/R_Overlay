		Delineating Temporal Dataset Shifts in Electronic Health Records
		// The 'EHRtemporalVariability' package contains functions to
		delineate temporal dataset shifts in Electronic Health Records
		through the projection and visualization of dissimilarities
		among data temporal batches. This is done through the
		estimation of data statistical distributions over time and
		their projection in non-parametric statistical manifolds
		uncovering the patterns of the data latent temporal
		variability. Dataset shifts can be explored and identified
		through visual analytics formats such as Data Temporal heatmaps
		and Information Geometric Temporal (IGT) plots. An additional
		'EHRtemporalVariability' Shiny app can be used to load and
		explore the package results and even to allow the use of these
		functions to those users non-experienced in R coding.
