		Delineating Temporal Dataset Shifts in Electronic Health Records
		// Functions to delineate temporal dataset shifts in Electronic
		Health Records through the projection and visualization of
		dissimilarities among data temporal batches. This is done
		through the estimation of data statistical distributions over
		time and their projection in non-parametric statistical
		manifolds, uncovering the patterns of the data latent temporal
		variability. 'EHRtemporalVariability' is particularly suitable
		for multi-modal data and categorical variables with a high
		number of values, common features of biomedical data where
		traditional statistical process control or time-series methods
		may not be appropriate. 'EHRtemporalVariability' allows you to
		explore and identify dataset shifts through visual analytics
		formats such as Data Temporal heatmaps and Information
		Geometric Temporal (IGT) plots. An additional
		'EHRtemporalVariability' Shiny app can be used to load and
		explore the package results and even to allow the use of these
		functions to those users non-experienced in R coding. Preprint
		published in medRxiv (Sez et al. 2020)
