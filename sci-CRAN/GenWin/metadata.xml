		Spline Based Window Boundaries for Genomic Analyses // Defines
		window or bin boundaries for the analysis of genomic data.
		Boundaries are based on the inflection points of a cubic
		smoothing spline fitted to the raw data. Along with defining
		boundaries, a technique to evaluate results obtained from
		unequally-sized windows is provided. Applications are
		particularly pertinent for, though not limited to, genome scans
		for selection based on variability between populations (e.g.
		using Wright's fixations index, Fst, which measures variability
		in subpopulations relative to the total population).
