		Bayesian Analysis of a Circular GLM // Perform a Bayesian
		analysis of a circular outcome General Linear Model (GLM),
		which allows regressing a circular outcome on linear and
		categorical predictors. Posterior samples are obtained by means
		of an MCMC algorithm written in 'C++' through 'Rcpp'.
		Estimation and credible intervals are provided, as well as
		hypothesis testing through Bayes Factors. See Mulder and
		Klugkist (2017) doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2017.07.001.
