		Extreme Value Analysis // General functions for performing
		extreme value analysis.  In particular, allows for inclusion of
		covariates into the parameters of the extreme-value
		distributions, as well as estimation through MLE, L-moments,
		generalized (penalized) MLE (GMLE), as well as Bayes.
		Inference methods include parametric normal approximation,
		profile-likelihood, Bayes, and bootstrapping.  Some bivariate
		functionality and dependence checking (e.g., auto-tail
		dependence function plot, extremal index estimation) is also
		included.  For a tutorial, see Gilleland and Katz (2016) doi:
		10.18637/jss.v072.i08 and for bootstrapping, please see
		Gilleland (2020) doi: 10.1175/JTECH-D-20-0070.1.
