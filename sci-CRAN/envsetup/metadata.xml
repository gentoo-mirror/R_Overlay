		Support the Setup of the R Environment for Clinical Trial
		Programming Workflows // The purpose of this package is to
		support the setup the R environment. The two main features are
		'autos', to automatically source files and/or directories into
		your environment, and 'paths' to consistently set path objects
		across projects for input and output. Both are implemented
		using a configuration file to allow easy, custom configurations
		that can be used for multiple or all projects.
