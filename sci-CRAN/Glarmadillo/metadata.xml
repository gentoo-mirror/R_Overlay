		Solve the Graphical Lasso Problem with 'Armadillo' // Efficiently
		implements the Graphical Lasso algorithm, utilizing the
		'Armadillo' 'C++' library for rapid computation. This algorithm
		introduces an L1 penalty to derive sparse inverse covariance
		matrices from observations of multivariate normal
		distributions. Features include the generation of random and
		structured sparse covariance matrices, beneficial for
		simulations, statistical method testing, and educational
		purposes in graphical modeling. A unique function for
		regularization parameter selection based on predefined sparsity
		levels is also offered, catering to users with specific
		sparsity requirements in their models. The methodology for
		sparse inverse covariance estimation implemented in this
		package is based on the work of Friedman, Hastie, and
		Tibshirani (2008) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxm045.
