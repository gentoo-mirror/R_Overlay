		Random Generation of Survival Data // Random generation of
		survival data from a wide range of regression models, including
		accelerated failure time (AFT), proportional hazards (PH),
		proportional odds (PO), accelerated hazard (AH), Yang and
		Prentice (YP), and extended hazard (EH) models. The package
		'rsurv' also stands out by its ability to generate survival
		data from an unlimited number of baseline distributions
		provided that an implementation of the quantile function of the
		chosen baseline distribution is available in R. Another nice
		feature of the package 'rsurv' lies in the fact that linear
		predictors are specified via a formula-based approach,
		facilitating the inclusion of categorical variables and
		interaction terms. The functions implemented in the package
		'rsurv' can also be employed to simulate survival data with
		more complex structures, such as survival data with different
		types of censoring mechanisms, survival data with cure
		fraction, survival data with random effects (frailties),
		multivariate survival data, and competing risks survival data.
		Details about the R package 'rsurv' can be found in Demarqui
		(2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.01750.
