		Stepwise Elimination and Term Reordering for Mixed-Effects
		Regression // Finds the largest possible regression model that
		will still converge for various types of regression analyses
		(including mixed models and generalized additive models) and
		then optionally performs stepwise elimination similar to the
		forward and backward effect selection methods in SAS, based on
		the change in log-likelihood or its significance, Akaike's
		Information Criterion, or the Bayesian Information Criterion.
