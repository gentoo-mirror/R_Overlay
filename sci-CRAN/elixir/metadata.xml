		Transmutation of Languages // Tools for transforming 'R'
		expressions. Provides functions for finding, extracting, and
		replacing patterns in 'R' language objects, similarly to how
		regular expressions can be used to find, extract, and replace
		patterns in text. Also provides functions for generating code
		using specially-formatted template files and for translating
		'R' expressions into similar expressions in other programming
		languages. The package may be helpful for advanced uses of 'R'
		expressions, such as developing domain-specific languages.
