		Tools for Handling Indices and Proportions in Small Area
		Estimation // It allows for mapping proportions and indicators
		defined on the unit interval. It implements Beta-based small
		area methods comprising the classical Beta regression models,
		the Flexible Beta model and Zero and/or One Inflated extensions
		(Janicki 2020 doi:10.1080/03610926.2019.1570266). Such methods,
		developed within a Bayesian framework through Stan https://mc-
		stan.org/, come equipped with a set of diagnostics and
		complementary tools, visualizing and exporting functions. A
		Shiny application with a user-friendly interface can be
		launched to further simplify the process.
