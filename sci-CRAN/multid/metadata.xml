		Multivariate Difference Between Two Groups // Estimation of
		multivariate differences between two groups (e.g., multivariate
		sex differences) with regularized regression methods and
		predictive approach. See Ilmarinen et al. (2023)
		doi:10.1177/08902070221088155. Deconstructing difference score
		correlations (e.g., gender-equality paradox), see Ilmarinen
		Lnnqvist (2024) doi:10.1037/pspp0000508. Includes also tools
		that help in understanding difference score reliability,
		conditional intra-class correlations, tail-dependency, and
		heterogeneity of variance estimates. Package development was
		supported by the Academy of Finland research grant 338891.
