		Multivariate Difference Between Two Groups // Estimation of
		multivariate differences between two groups (e.g., multivariate
		sex differences) with regularized regression methods and
		predictive approach. See Lnnqvist  Ilmarinen (2021)
		doi:10.1007/s11109-021-09681-2 and Ilmarinen et al. (2022)
		doi:10.1177/08902070221088155. Includes tools that help in
		understanding difference score reliability, predictions of
		difference score variables, conditional intra-class
		correlations, and heterogeneity of variance estimates. Package
		development was supported by the Academy of Finland research
		grant 338891.
