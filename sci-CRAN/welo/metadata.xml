		Weighted and Standard Elo Rates // Estimates the standard and
		weighted Elo (WElo, Angelini et al., 2021
		doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2021.04.011) rates. The current version
		provides these rates for tennis. In the future, new sports will
		be added. The 'welo' package offers a flexible tool to estimate
		the WElo and Elo rates, according to different systems of
		weights (games or sets) and scale factors (constant,
		proportional to the number of matches, with more weight on
		Grand Slam matches or on matches played on a specific surface).
		Moreover, the package gives the possibility of estimating the
		(bootstrap) standard errors for the rates. Finally, the package
		includes a betting function which automatically selects the
		matches on which place a bet.
