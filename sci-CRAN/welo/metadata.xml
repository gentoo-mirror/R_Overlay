		Weighted and Standard Elo Rates // Estimates the standard and
		weighted Elo (WElo, Angelini et al., 2022
		doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2021.04.011) rates. The current version
		provides Elo and WElo rates for tennis, according to different
		systems of weights (games or sets) and scale factors (constant,
		proportional to the number of matches, with more weight on
		Grand Slam matches or matches played on a specific surface).
		Moreover, the package gives the possibility of estimating the
		(bootstrap) standard errors for the rates. Finally, the package
		includes betting functions that automatically select the
		matches on which place a bet.
