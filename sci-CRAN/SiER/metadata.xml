		Signal Extraction Approach for Sparse Multivariate Response
		Regression // Methods for regression with high-dimensional
		predictors and  univariate or maltivariate response variables.
		It considers the decomposition of the coefficient matrix that
		leads to the best approximation to the signal part in the
		response given any rank, and estimates the decomposition by
		solving a penalized generalized eigenvalue problem followed by
		a least squares procedure. Ruiyan Luo and Xin Qi (2017)
