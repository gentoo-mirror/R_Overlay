		Diagonally Dominant Principal Component Analysis // Consider the
		problem of decomposing a large covariance matrix into a low
		rank matrix plus a diagonally dominant matrix. This problem is
		called Diagonally Dominant Principal Component Analysis (DD-
		PCA) in the reference Ke, Z., Xue, L. and Yang, F. (2019)
		arXiv:1906.00051. DD-PCA can be used in covariance matrix
		estimation and global detection in multiple testing. This
		package implements DD-PCA using both convex approach and non-
		convex approach; Convex approach refers to solving a convex
		relaxation of the original problem using Alternating Direction
		Method of Multipliers (ADMM), while non-convex approach resorts
		to an iterative projection algorithm. This package also
		implements two global testing methods proposed in the
		reference.
