		Diagonally Dominant Principal Component Analysis // Efficient
		procedures for fitting the DD-PCA (Ke et al., 2019,
		arXiv:1906.00051)  by decomposing a large covariance matrix
		into a low-rank matrix plus a diagonally dominant matrix. The
		implementation of DD-PCA includes the convex approach using the
		Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and the non-
		convex approach using the iterative projection algorithm.
		Applications of DD-PCA to large covariance matrix estimation
		and global multiple testing are also included in this package.
