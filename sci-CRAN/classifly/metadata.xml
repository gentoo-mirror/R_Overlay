		Explore Classification Models in High Dimensions // Given
		$p$-dimensional training data containing $d$ groups (the design
		space), a classification algorithm (classifier) predicts which
		group new data belongs to.  Generally the input to these
		algorithms is high dimensional, and the boundaries between
		groups will be high dimensional and perhaps curvilinear or
		multi-faceted. This package implements methods for
		understanding the division of space between the groups.
