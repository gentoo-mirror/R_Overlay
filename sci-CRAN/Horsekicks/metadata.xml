		Provide Extensions to the Prussian Army Death by Horsekick Data
		// We provide extensions to the classical dataset "Example 4:
		Death by the kick of a horse in the Prussian Army" first used
		by Ladislaus von Bortkeiwicz in his treatise on the Poisson
		distribution "Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen",
		DOI:10.1017/S0370164600019453.  As well as an extended time
		series for the horse-kick death data, we also provide, in
		parallel, deaths by falling from a horse and by drowning.
