		Analysis of Oceanographic Data // Supports the analysis of
		Oceanographic data, including 'ADCP' measurements, measurements
		made with 'argo' floats, 'CTD' measurements, sectional data,
		sea-level time series, coastline and topographic data, etc.
		Provides specialized functions for calculating seawater
		properties such as potential temperature in either the 'UNESCO'
		or 'TEOS-10' equation of state. Produces graphical displays
		that conform to the conventions of the Oceanographic
		literature. This package is discussed extensively by Kelley
		(2018) "Oceanographic Analysis with R"
