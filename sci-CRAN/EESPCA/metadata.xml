		Eigenvectors from Eigenvalues Sparse Principal Component Analysis
		(EESPCA) // Contains logic for computing sparse principal
		components via the EESPCA method, which is based on an
		approximation of the eigenvector/eigenvalue identity. Includes
		logic to support execution of the TPower and rifle sparse PCA
		methods, as well as logic to estimate the sparsity parameters
		used by EESPCA, TPower and rifle via cross-validation to
		minimize the out-of-sample reconstruction error. H. Robert
		Frost (2021) arXiv:2006.01924.
