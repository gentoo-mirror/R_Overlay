		Split Knockoffs for Structural Sparsity // A novel method for
		controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in structural
		sparsity setting. This proposed scheme relaxes the linear
		subspace constraint to its neighborhood, often known as
		variable splitting in optimization. Simulation experiments can
		be reproduced following the Vignette. 'Split Knockoffs' is
		defined in Cao et al. (2021) arXiv:2103.16159.
