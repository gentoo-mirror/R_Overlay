		Split Knockoffs for Structural Sparsity // Split Knockoff is a
		data adaptive variable selection framework for controlling the
		(directional) false discovery rate (FDR) in structural
		sparsity, where variable selection on linear transformation of
		parameters is of concern. This proposed scheme relaxes the
		linear subspace constraint to its neighborhood, often known as
		variable splitting in optimization. Simulation experiments can
		be reproduced following the Vignette. We include data (both
		.mat and .csv format) and application with our method of
		Alzheimer's Disease study in this package. 'Split Knockoffs' is
		first defined in Cao et al. (2021) arXiv:2103.16159.
