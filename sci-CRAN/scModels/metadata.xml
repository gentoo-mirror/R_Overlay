		Fitting Discrete Distribution Models to Count Data // Provides
		functions for fitting discrete distribution models to count
		data. Included are the Poisson, the negative binomial and, most
		importantly, a new implementation of the Poisson-beta
		distribution (density, distribution and quantile functions, and
		random number generator) together with a needed new
		implementation of Kummer's function (also: confluent
		hypergeometric function of the first kind). Three different
		implementations of the Gillespie algorithm allow data
		simulation based on the basic, switching or bursting mRNA
		generating processes. Moreover, likelihood functions for four
		variants of each of the three aforementioned distributions are
		also available. The variants include one population and two
		population mixtures, both with and without zero-inflation. The
		package depends on the 'MPFR' libraries (https://www.mpfr.org/)
		which need to be installed separately (see description at
		https://github.com/fuchslab/scModels). This package is
		supplement to the paper "A mechanistic model for the negative
		binomial distribution of single-cell mRNA counts" by Lisa
		Amrhein, Kumar Harsha and Christiane Fuchs (2019)
		doi:10.1101/657619 available on bioRxiv.
