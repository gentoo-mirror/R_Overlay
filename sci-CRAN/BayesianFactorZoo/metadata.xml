		Bayesian Solutions for the Factor Zoo: We Just Ran Two
		Quadrillion Models // Contains the functions to use the
		econometric methods in the paper Bryzgalova, Huang, and
		Julliard (2023) doi:10.1111/jofi.13197. In this package, we
		provide a novel Bayesian framework for analyzing linear asset
		pricing models: simple, robust, and applicable to high-
		dimensional problems. For a stand-alone model, we provide
		functions including BayesianFM() and BayesianSDF() to deliver
		reliable price of risk estimates for both tradable and
		nontradable factors. For competing factors and possibly
		nonnested models, we provide functions including
		continuous_ss_sdf(), continuous_ss_sdf_v2(), and
		dirac_ss_sdf_pvalue() to analyze high-dimensional models. If
		you use this package, please cite the paper. We are thankful to
		Yunan Ding and Jingtong Zhang for their research assistance.
