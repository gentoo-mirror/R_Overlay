		Safe Policy Learning under Regression Discontinuity Design with
		Multiple Cutoffs // Implements safe policy learning under
		regression discontinuity designs with multiple cutoffs, based
		on Zhang et al. (2022) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.13323. The
		learned cutoffs are guaranteed  to perform no worse than the
		existing cutoffs in terms of overall outcomes. The 'rdlearn'
		package also includes features for visualizing the learned
		cutoffs relative to the baseline and conducting sensitivity
		analyses.
