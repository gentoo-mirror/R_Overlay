		Heterogeneous Graphical Model for Non-Negative Data // Graphical
		model is an informative and powerful tool to explore the
		conditional dependence relationships among variables. The
		traditional Gaussian graphical model and its extensions either
		have a Gaussian assumption on the data distribution or assume
		the data are homogeneous. However, there are data with complex
		distributions violating these two assumptions. For example, the
		air pollutant concentration records are non-negative and,
		hence, non-Gaussian. Moreover, due to climate changes,
		distributions of these concentration records in different
		months of a year can be far different, which means it is
		uncertain whether datasets from different months are
		homogeneous. Methods with a Gaussian or homogeneous assumption
		may incorrectly model the conditional dependence relationships
		among variables. Therefore, we propose a heterogeneous
		graphical model for non-negative data (HGMND) to simultaneously
		cluster multiple datasets and estimate the conditional
		dependence matrix of variables from a non-Gaussian and non-
		negative exponential family in each cluster.
