		Functional Clustering of Redundant Components of a System //
		Cluster together the components that make up an interactive
		system on the basis of their functional redundancy for one or
		more collective, systemic performances. Plot the hierarchical
		tree of component clusters, the modelled and predicted
		performances of component assemblages, and other results
		associated with a functional clustering. Test and prioritize
		the significance of the different components that make up the
		interactive system, of the different assemblages of components
		that make up the dataset, and of the different performances
		observed on the component assemblages. The method finds
		application in ecology, for instance, where the system is an
		ecosystem, the components are organisms or species, and the
		systemic performance is the production of biomass or the
		respiration of the ecosystem. The method is extensively
		described in Jaillard B, Deleporte P, Loreau M, Violle C (2018)
		"A combinatorial analysis using observational data identifies
		species that govern ecosystem functioning"
