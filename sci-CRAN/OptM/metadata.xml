		Estimating the Optimal Number of Migration Edges from 'Treemix'
		// The popular population genetic software 'Treemix' by
		'Pickrell and Pritchard' (2012)
		DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002967 estimates the number of
		migration edges on a population tree. However, it can be
		difficult to determine the number of migration edges to
		include. Previously, it was customary to stop adding migration
		edges when 99.8% of variation in the data was explained, but
		'OptM' automates this process using an ad hoc statistic based
		on the second-order rate of change in the log likelihood.
		'OptM' also has added functionality for various threshold
		modeling to compare with the ad hoc statistic.
