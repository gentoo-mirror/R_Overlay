		Multivariate Detrended Fluctuation Analysis // This R package
		provides an implementation of multivariate extensions of a
		well-known fractal analysis technique, Detrended Fluctuations
		Analysis (DFA; Peng et al., 1995doi:10.1063/1.166141), for
		multivariate time series: multivariate DFA (mvDFA). Several
		coefficients are implemented that take into account the
		correlation structure of the multivariate time series to
		varying degrees. These coefficients may be used to analyze long
		memory and changes in the dynamic structure that would by
		univariate DFA. Therefore, this R package aims to extend and
		complement the original univariate DFA (Peng et al., 1995) for
		estimating the scaling properties of nonstationary time series.
