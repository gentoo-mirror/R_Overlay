		Analyze Mathematical Models of Healthcare Facility Transmission
		// Calculate useful quantities for a user-defined differential
		equation model of infectious disease transmission among
		individuals in a healthcare facility. Input rates of transition
		between states of individuals with and without the disease-
		causing organism, distributions of states at facility
		admission, relative infectivity of transmissible states, and
		the facility length of stay distribution. Calculate the model
		equilibrium and the basic facility reproduction number, as
		described in Toth et al. (2025)
