		Student Growth Percentiles  Percentile Growth Trajectories //
		Functions to calculate student growth percentiles and
		percentile growth projections/trajectories for students using
		large scale, longitudinal assessment data.  Functions use
		quantile regression to estimate the conditional density
		associated with each student's achievement history.  Percentile
		growth projections/trajectories are calculated using the
		coefficient matrices derived from the quantile regression
		analyses and specify what percentile growth is required for
		students to reach future achievement targets.
