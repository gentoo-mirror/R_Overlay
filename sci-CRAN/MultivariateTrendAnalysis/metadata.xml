		Univariate and Multivariate Trend Testing // With foundations on
		the work by Goutali and Chebana (2024)
		doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.106090, this package contains
		various univariate and multivariate trend tests. The main
		functions regard the Multivariate Dependence Trend and
		Multivariate Overall Trend tests as proposed by Goutali and
		Chebana (2024), as well as a plotting function that proves
		useful as a summary and complement of the tests. Although many
		packages and methods carry univariate tests, the Mann-Kendall
		and Spearman's rho test implementations are included in the
		package with an adapted version to hydrological formulation
		(e.g. as in Rao and Hamed 1998
		doi:10.1016/S0022-1694(97)00125-X or Chebana 2022
		doi:10.1016/C2021-0-01317-1). For better understanding of the
		example use of the functions, three datasets are included.
		These are synthetic data and shouldn't be used beyond that
		purpose.
