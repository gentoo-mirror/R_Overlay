		Aids in the Analysis of Genes Influencing Cancer Survival // Aids
		in the analysis of genes influencing cancer survival by
		including a principal function, calculator(), which calculates
		the P-value for each provided gene under the optimal cutoff in
		cancer survival studies. Grounded in methodologies from
		significant works, this package references Therneau's
		'survival' package (Therneau, 2024;
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) and the survival
		analysis extensions by Therneau and Grambsch (2000, ISBN
		0-387-98784-3). It also integrates the 'survminer' package by
		Kassambara et al. (2021;
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survminer), enhancing
		survival curve visualizations with 'ggplot2'.
