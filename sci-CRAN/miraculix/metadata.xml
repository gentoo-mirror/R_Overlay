		Algebraic and Statistical Functions for Genetics // This is a
		collection of fast tools for application in quantitative
		genetics. For instance, the SNP matrix can be stored in a
		minimum of memory  and the calculation of the genomic
		relationship matrix is based on a rapid algorithm. It also
		contains the window scanning approach by Kabluchko and Spodarev
		(2009), doi:10.1239/aap/1240319575 to detect anomalous genomic
		areas doi:10.1186/s12864-018-5009-y. Furthermore, the package
		is used in the Modular Breeding Program Simulator (MoBPS,
		https://github.com/tpook92/MoBPS, http://www.mobps.de/). The
		tools are based on SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data,
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) and OMP (Open Multi-
		Processing, https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP).
