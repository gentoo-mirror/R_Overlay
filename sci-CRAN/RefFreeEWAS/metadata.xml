		EWAS using Reference-Free DNA Methylation Mixture Deconvolution
		// Reference-free method for conducting EWAS while
		deconvoluting DNA methylation arising as mixtures of cell
		types. The older method (Houseman et al.,
		2014,doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu029) is similar to surrogate
		variable analysis (SVA and ISVA), except that it makes
		additional use of a biological mixture assumption. The newer
		method (Houseman et al., 2016, doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1140-4)
		is similar to non-negative matrix factorization, with
		additional constraints and additional utilities.
