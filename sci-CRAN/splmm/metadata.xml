		Simultaneous Penalized Linear Mixed Effects Models // Contains
		functions that fit linear mixed-effects models for high-
		dimensional data (pn) with penalty for both the fixed effects
		and random effects for variable selection. The details of the
		algorithm can be found in Luoying Yang PhD thesis (Yang and Wu
		2020). The algorithm implementation is based on the R package
		'lmmlasso'. Reference: Yang L, Wu TT (2020). Model-Based
		Clustering of Longitudinal Data in High-Dimensionality.
		Unpublished thesis.
