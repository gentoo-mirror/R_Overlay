		Implementation of Sampling Formulas for the Unified Neutral Model
		of Biodiversity and Biogeography, with or without Guild
		Structure // The GUILDS package combines a range of sampling
		formulas for the unified neutral model of biogeography and
		biodiversity. Alongside the sampling formulas, it includes
		methods to perform maximum likelihood optimization of the
		sampling formulas, methods to generate data given the neutral
		model, and methods to estimate the expected species abundance
		distribution. Sampling formulas included in the GUILDS package
		are the Etienne Sampling Formula (Etienne 2005), the guild
		sampling formula, where guilds are assumed to differ in
		dispersal ability (Janzen et al. 2015), and  the guilds
		sampling formula conditioned on guild size (Janzen et al.
		2015).
