		Implementation of Sampling Formulas for the Unified Neutral Model
		of Biodiversity and Biogeography, with or without Guild
		Structure // A collection of sampling formulas for the unified
		neutral model of biogeography and biodiversity. Alongside the
		sampling formulas, it includes methods to perform maximum
		likelihood optimization of the sampling formulas, methods to
		generate data given the neutral model, and methods to estimate
		the expected species abundance distribution. Sampling formulas
		included in the GUILDS package are the Etienne Sampling Formula
		(Etienne 2005), the guild sampling formula, where guilds are
		assumed to differ in dispersal ability (Janzen et al. 2015),
		and the guilds sampling formula conditioned on guild size
		(Janzen et al. 2015).
