		Tools for Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) Errors // Provides
		tools for working with Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude)
		errors, as proposed in Gelman and Tuerlinckx (2000)
		doi.org/10.1007/s001800000040 and Gelman  Carlin (2014)
		doi.org/10.1177/1745691614551642. In addition to simply
		calculating the probability of Type S/M error, the package
		includes functions for calculating these errors across a
		variety of effect sizes for comparison, and recommended sample
		size given "tolerances" for Type S/M errors. To improve the
		speed of these calculations, closed forms solutions for the
		probability of a Type S/M error from Lu, Qiu, and Deng (2018)
		doi.org/10.1111/bmsp.12132 are implemented. As of 1.0.0, this
		includes support only for simple research designs. See the
		package vignette for a fuller exposition on how Type S/M errors
		arise in research, and how to analyze them using the type of
		design analysis proposed in the above papers.
