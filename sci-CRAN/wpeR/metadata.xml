		Streamlined Analysis of Wild Pedigree Data // Analyzing pedigree
		data of wild populations. While primarily designed to process
		outputs from the 'COLONY' (Jones  Wang (2010)
		doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02787.x) pedigree reconstruction
		software, it can also accommodate data from other sources. By
		linking reconstructed pedigrees with genetic sample metadata,
		'wpeR' produces spatial and temporal visualizations as well as
		tabular summaries that support interpretation of family
		structures and dynamics. The main goal of the package is to
		provide a solution for the analysis of complex wild pedigree
		data and to help the user to gain insights into genetic
		relationships within wild animal populations.
