		Processing and Transforming Relational Event History Data //
		Efficiently processes relational event history data and
		transforms them into formats suitable for other packages. The
		primary objective of this package is to convert event history
		data into a format that integrates with the packages in
		'remverse' and is compatible with various analytical tools
		(e.g., computing network statistics, estimating tie-oriented or
		actor-oriented social network models). Second, it can also
		transform the data into formats compatible with other packages
		out of 'remverse'. The package processes the data for two types
		of temporal social network models: tie-oriented modeling
		framework (Butts, C., 2008,
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x) and actor-oriented
		modeling framework (Stadtfeld, C.,  Block, P., 2017,
		doi:10.15195/v4.a14).
