		Computing f-Statistics and Building Admixture Graphs Based on
		Allele Count or Pool-Seq Read Count Data // Functions for the
		computation of f- and D-statistics (estimation of 'Fst',
		Patterson's 'F2', 'F3', 'F3*', 'F4' and D parameters) in
		population genomics studies from allele count or Pool-Seq read
		count data and for the fitting, building and visualization of
		admixture graphs. The package also includes several utilities
		to manipulate Pool-Seq data stored in standard format (e.g.,
		such as 'vcf' files or 'rsync' files generated by the the
		'PoPoolation' software) and perform conversion to alternative
		format (as used in the 'BayPass' and 'SelEstim' software). As
		of version 2.0, the package also includes utilities to
		manipulate standard allele count data (e.g., stored in
		'TreeMix', 'BayPass' or 'SelEstim' format).
