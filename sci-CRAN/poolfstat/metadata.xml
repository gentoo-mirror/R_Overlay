		Computing F-Statistics from Pool-Seq Data // Functions for the
		computation of F-statistics from Pool-Seq data in population
		genomics studies. The package also includes several utilities
		to manipulate Pool-Seq data stored in standard format ('vcf'
		and 'rsync' files as obtained from the popular software
		'VarScan' and 'PoPoolation' respectively) and perform
		conversion to alternative format (as used in the 'BayPass' and
		'SelEstim' software).
