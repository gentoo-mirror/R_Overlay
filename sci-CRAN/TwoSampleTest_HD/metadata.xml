		A Two-Sample Test for the Equality of Distributions for High-
		Dimensional Data // For high-dimensional data whose main
		feature is a large number, p, of variables but a small sample
		size, the null hypothesis that the marginal distributions of p
		variables are the same for two groups is tested. We propose a
		test statistic motivated by the simple idea of comparing, for
		each of the p variables, the empirical characteristic functions
		computed from the two samples. If one rejects this global null
		hypothesis of no differences in distributions between the two
		groups, a set of permutation p-values is reported to identify
		which variables are not equally distributed in both groups.
