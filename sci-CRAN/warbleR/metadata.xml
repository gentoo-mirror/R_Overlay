		Streamline Bioacoustic Analysis // Functions aiming to facilitate
		the analysis of the structure of animal acoustic signals in
		'R'. Users can collect open-access avian recordings or enter
		their own data into a workflow that facilitates spectrographic
		visualization and measurement of acoustic parameters. 'warbleR'
		makes use of the basic sound analysis tools from the package
		'seewave', and offers new tools for acoustic structure
		analysis. The main features of the package are the use of loops
		to apply tasks through acoustic signals referenced in a
		selection (annotation) table and the production of spectrograms
		in image files that allow to organize data and verify acoustic
		analyzes. The package offers functions to explore, organize and
		manipulate multiple sound files, explore and download
		'XenoCanto' recordings, detect signals automatically, create
		spectrograms of complete recordings or individual signals, run
		different measures of acoustic signal structure, evaluate the
		performance of measurement methods, catalog signals,
		characterize different structural levels in acoustic signals,
		run statistical analysis of duet coordination and consolidate
		databases and annotation tables, among others.
