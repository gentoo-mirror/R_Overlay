		Streamline Bioacoustic Analysis // A tool to streamline the
		analysis of animal acoustic signal structure. The package
		offers functions for downloading avian vocalizations from the
		open-access online repository 'Xeno-Canto' http://xeno-
		canto.org/, manipulating sound files, detecting acoustic
		signals, assessing performance of methods that measure acoustic
		similarity, conducting cross-correlations, dynamic time
		warping, measuring acoustic parameters and analysing
		interactive vocal signals, among others. Most functions working
		iteratively allow parallelization to improve computational
		efficiency.
