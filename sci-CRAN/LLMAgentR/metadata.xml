		Language Model Agents in R for AI Workflows and Research //
		Provides modular, graph-based agents powered by large language
		models (LLMs) for intelligent task execution in R. Supports
		structured workflows for tasks such as forecasting, data
		visualization, feature engineering, data wrangling, data
		cleaning, SQL, code generation, weather reporting, and
		research-driven question answering. Each agent performs
		iterative reasoning: recommending steps, generating R code,
		executing, debugging, and explaining results. Includes built-in
		support for packages such as 'tidymodels', 'modeltime',
		'plotly', 'ggplot2', and 'prophet'. Designed for analysts,
		developers, and teams building intelligent, reproducible AI
		workflows in R. Compatible with LLM providers such as 'OpenAI',
		'Anthropic', 'Groq', and 'Ollama'. Inspired by the Python
		package 'langagent'.
