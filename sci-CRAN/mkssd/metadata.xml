		Efficient Multi-Level k-Circulant Supersaturated Designs //
		Generates efficient balanced non-aliased multi-level
		k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging the
		elements of the generator vector. Attempts to generate a
		supersaturated design that has chisquare efficiency more than
		user specified efficiency level (mef). Displays the progress of
		generation of an efficient multi-level k-circulant design
		through a progress bar. The progress of 100% means that one
		full round of interchange is completed. More than one full
		round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for
		larger designs.
