		Depth-Dependent Binocular Visual Fields Simulation // Simulation
		and visualization depth-dependent integrated visual fields.
		Visual fields are measured monocularly at a single depth, yet
		real-life activities involve predominantly binocular vision at
		multiple depths. The package provides functions to simulate and
		visualize binocular visual field impairment in a depth-
		dependent fashion from monocular visual field results based on
		Ping Liu, Allison McKendrick, Anna Ma-Wyatt, Andrew Turpin
		(2019) doi:10.1167/tvst.9.3.8. At each location and depth
		plane, sensitivities are linearly interpolated from
		corresponding locations in monocular visual field and returned
		as the higher value of the two. Its utility is demonstrated by
		evaluating DD-IVF defects associated with 12 glaucomatous
		archetypes of 24-2 visual field pattern in the included 'shiny'
		apps.
