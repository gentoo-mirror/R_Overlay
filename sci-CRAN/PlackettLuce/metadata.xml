		Plackett-Luce Models for Rankings // Functions to prepare
		rankings data and fit the Plackett-Luce model jointly
		attributed to Plackett (1975) doi:10.2307/2346567 and Luce
		(1959, ISBN:0486441369). The standard Plackett-Luce model is
		generalized to accommodate ties of any order in the ranking.
		Partial rankings, in which only a subset of items are ranked in
		each ranking, are also accommodated in the implementation.
		Disconnected/weakly connected networks implied by the rankings
		may be handled by adding pseudo-rankings with a hypothetical
		item. Optionally, a multivariate normal prior may be set on the
		log-worth parameters and ranker reliabilities may be
		incorporated as proposed by Raman and Joachims (2014)
		doi:10.1145/2623330.2623654. Maximum a posteriori estimation is
		used when priors are set. Methods are provided to estimate
		standard errors or quasi-standard errors for inference as well
		as to fit Plackett-Luce trees. See the package website or
		vignette for further details.
