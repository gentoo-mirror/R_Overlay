		Merge-Split Samplers for Conjugate Bayesian Nonparametric Models
		// Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for posterior simulations
		of conjugate Bayesian nonparametric mixture models.
		Functionality is provided for Gibbs sampling as in Algorithm 3
		of Neal (2000) DOI:10.1080/10618600.2000.10474879, restricted
		Gibbs merge-split sampling as described in Jain  Neal (2004)
		DOI:10.1198/1061860043001, and sequentially-allocated merge-
		split sampling DOI:10.1080/00949655.2021.1998502, as well as
		summary and utility functions.
