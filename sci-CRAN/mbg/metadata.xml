		Model-Based Geostatistics // Modern model-based geostatistics for
		point-referenced data. This package provides a simple interface
		to run spatial machine learning models and geostatistical
		models that estimate a continuous (raster) surface from point-
		referenced outcomes and, optionally, a set of raster
		covariates. The package also includes functions to summarize
		raster outcomes by (polygon) region while preserving
		uncertainty.
