		Computing Sensitivity at a Fix Value of Specificity and Vice
		Versa as Well as Bootstrap Metrics for ROC Curves // For a
		binary classification the adjusted sensitivity and specificity
		are measured for a given fixed threshold. If the threshold for
		either sensitivity or specificity is not given, the crossing
		point between the sensitivity and specificity curves are
		returned. For bootstrap procedures, mean and CI bootstrap
		values of sensitivity, specificity, crossing point between
		specificity and specificity as well as AUC and AUCPR can be
		evaluated.
