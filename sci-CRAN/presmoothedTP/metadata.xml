		Presmoothed Landmark Aalen-Johansen Estimator of Transition
		Probabilities for Complex Multi-State Models // Multi-state
		models are essential tools in longitudinal data analysis. One
		primary goal of these models is the estimation of transition
		probabilities, a critical metric for predicting clinical
		prognosis across various stages of diseases or medical
		conditions. Traditionally, inference in multi-state models
		relies on the Aalen-Johansen (AJ) estimator which is consistent
		under the Markov assumption. However, in many practical
		applications, the Markovian nature of the process is often not
		guaranteed, limiting the applicability of the AJ estimator in
		more complex scenarios. This package extends the landmark
		Aalen-Johansen estimator (Putter, H, Spitoni, C (2018)
		doi:10.1177/0962280216674497) incorporating presmoothing
		techniques described by Soutinho, Meira-Machado and Oliveira
		(2020) doi:10.1080/03610918.2020.1762895, offering a robust
		alternative for estimating transition probabilities in non-
		Markovian multi-state models with multiple states and potential
		reversible transitions.
