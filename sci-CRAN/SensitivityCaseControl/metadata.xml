		Sensitivity Analysis for Case-Control Studies // Sensitivity
		analysis for case-control studies in which some cases may meet
		a more narrow definition of being a case compared to other
		cases which only meet a broad definition.  The sensitivity
		analyses are described in Small, Cheng, Halloran and Rosenbaum
		(2013, "Case Definition and Sensitivity Analysis", Journal of
		the American Statistical Association, 1457-1468).  The
		functions sens.analysis.mh and sens.analysis.aberrant.rank
		provide sensitivity analyses based on the Mantel-Haenszel test
		statistic and aberrant rank test statistic as described in
		Rosenbaum (1991, "Sensitivity Analysis for Matched Case Control
		Studies", Biometrics); see also Section 1 of Small et al.  The
		function adaptive.case.test provides adaptive inferences as
		described in Section 5 of Small et al.  The function
		adaptive.noether.brown provides a sensitivity analysis for a
		matched cohort study based on an adaptive test.  The other
		functions in the package are internal functions.
