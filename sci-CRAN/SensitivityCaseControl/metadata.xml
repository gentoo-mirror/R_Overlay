		Sensitivity Analysis for Case-Control Studies // This package
		performs sensitivity analysis for case-control studies in which
		some cases may meet a more narrow definition of being a case
		compared to other cases which only meet a broad definition.
		The sensitivity analyses are described in Small, Cheng,
		Halloran and Rosenbaum (2013, "Case Definition and Sensitivity
		Analysis", Journal of the American Statistical Association,
		1457-1468).  The functions sens.analysis.mh and
		sens.analysis.aberrant.rank provide sensitivity analyses based
		on the Mantel-Haenszel test statistic and aberrant rank test
		statistic as described in Rosenbaum (1991, "Sensitivity
		Analysis for Matched Case Control Studies", Biometrics); see
		also Section 1 of Small et al.  The function adaptive.case.test
		provides adaptive inferences as described in Section 5 of Small
		et al.  The function adaptive.noether.brown provides a
		sensitivity analysis for a matched cohort study based on an
		adaptive test.  The other functions in the package are internal
		functions.
