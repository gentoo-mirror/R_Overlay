		Bayesian Effect Fusion for Categorical Predictors // Variable
		selection and Bayesian effect fusion for categorical predictors
		in linear and logistic regression models. Effect fusion aims at
		the question which categories have a similar effect on the
		response and therefore can be fused to obtain a sparser
		representation of the model. Effect fusion and variable
		selection can be obtained either with a prior that has an
		interpretation as spike and slab prior on the level effect
		differences or with a sparse finite mixture prior on the level
		effects. The regression coefficients are estimated with a flat
		uninformative prior after model selection or by taking model
		averages. Posterior inference is accomplished by an MCMC
		sampling scheme which makes use of a data augmentation strategy
		(Polson, Scott  Windle (2013) doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.829001)
		based on latent Polya-Gamma random variables in the case of
		logistic regression. The code for data augmentation is taken
		from Polson et al. (2013) doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.829001, who
		own the copyright.
