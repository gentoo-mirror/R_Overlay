		Automated Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Arbitrarily Structured
		Correlation Matrices // Supports automated Markov chain Monte
		Carlo for arbitrarily structured correlation matrices. The user
		supplies data, a correlation matrix in symbolic form, the
		current state of the chain, a function that computes the log
		likelihood, and a list of prior distributions. The package's
		flagship function then carries out a parameter-at-a-time update
		of all correlation parameters, and returns the new state. The
		method is presented in Hughes (2023), in preparation.
