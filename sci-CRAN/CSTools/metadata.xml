		Assessing Skill of Climate Forecasts on Seasonal-to-Decadal
		Timescales // Exploits dynamical seasonal forecasts in order to
		provide information relevant to stakeholders at the seasonal
		timescale. The package contains process-based methods for
		forecast calibration, bias correction, statistical and
		stochastic downscaling, optimal forecast combination and
		multivariate verification, as well as basic and advanced tools
		to obtain tailored products. This package was developed in the
		context of the ERA4CS project MEDSCOPE. Doblas-Reyes et al.
