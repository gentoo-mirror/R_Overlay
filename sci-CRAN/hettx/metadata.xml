		Fisherian and Neymanian Methods for Detecting and Measuring
		Treatment Effect Variation // Implements methods developed by
		Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016) doi:10.1111/rssb.12124
		arXiv:1412.5000, and Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2018)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1407322 arXiv:1605.06566 for testing
		whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects
		across observations, and for characterizing the extent of the
		explained and unexplained variation in treatment effects. The
		package includes wrapper functions implementing the proposed
		methods, as well as helper functions for analyzing and
		visualizing the results of the test.
