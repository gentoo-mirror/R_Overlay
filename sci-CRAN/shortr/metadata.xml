		Optimal Subset Identification in Undirected Weighted Network
		Models // Identifies what optimal subset of a desired number of
		items should be retained in a short version of a psychometric
		instrument to assess the broadest proportion of the construct-
		level content of the set of items included in the original
		version of the said psychometric instrument. Expects a
		symmetric adjacency matrix as input (undirected weighted
		network model). Supports brute force and simulated annealing
		combinatorial search algorithms.
