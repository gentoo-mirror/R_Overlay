		Multiple Pairwise Comparison Tests // Multiple pairwise
		comparison tests on tidy data for one-way analysis of variance
		for both between-subjects and within-subjects designs.
		Currently, it supports only the most common types of
		statistical analyses and tests: parametric (Welch's and
		Student's t-test), nonparametric (Durbin-Conover and Dunn
		test), robust (Yuens trimmed means test), and Bayes Factor
		(Student's t-test).
