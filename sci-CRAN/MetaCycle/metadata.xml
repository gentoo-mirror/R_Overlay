		Evaluate Periodicity in Large Scale Data // There are two
		functions-meta2d and meta3d for detecting rhythmic signals from
		time-series datasets. For analyzing time-series datasets
		without individual information, 'meta2d' is suggested, which
		could incorporates multiple methods from ARSER, JTK_CYCLE and
		Lomb-Scargle in the detection of interested rhythms. For
		analyzing time-series datasets with individual information,
		'meta3d' is suggested, which takes use of any one of these
		three methods to analyze time-series data individual by
		individual and gives out integrated values based on analysis
		result of each individual.
