		Formalized Plots for Self-Describing Data // Creates fully-
		annotated plots with minimum guidance. Since the data is self-
		describing, less effort is needed for creating the plot.
		Generally expects data of class folded (see 'fold' package). If
		attributes GUIDE and LABEL are present, they will be used to
		create formal axis labels. Several aesthetics are supported,
		such as reference lines, unity lines, smooths, and log
		transformations.
