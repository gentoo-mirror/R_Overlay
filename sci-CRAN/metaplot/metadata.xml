		Data-Driven Plot Design // Designs plots in terms of core
		structure.  See 'example(metaplot)'. Primary arguments are
		(unquoted) column names; order and type (numeric or not)
		dictate the resulting plot.  Specify any y variables, x
		variable, any groups variable, and any conditioning variables
		to metaplot() to generate density plots, boxplots, mosaic
		plots, scatterplots, scatterplot matrices, or conditioned
		plots. Use multiplot() to arrange plots in grids. Wherever
		present, scalar column attributes 'label' and 'guide' are
		honored, producing fully annotated plots with minimal effort.
		Attribute 'guide' is typically units, but may be encoded() to
		provide interpretations of categorical values (see '?encode').
		Utility unpack() transforms scalar column attributes to row
		values and pack() does the reverse, supporting tool-neutral
		storage of metadata along with primary data. The package
		supports customizable aesthetics such as such as reference
		lines, unity lines, smooths, log transformation, and linear
		fits. The user may choose between trellis and ggplot output.
		Compact syntax and integrated metadata promote workflow
		scalability.
