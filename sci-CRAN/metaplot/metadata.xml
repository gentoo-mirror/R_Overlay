		Formalized Plots with Systematic Metadata // Designs plots in
		terms of core structure.  See 'example(metaplot)'. Primary
		arguments are (unquoted) column names; order and type (numeric
		or not) dictate the resulting plot.  Specify any y variables, x
		variable, any groups variable, and any conditioning variables
		to metaplot() to generate density plots, boxplots,
		scatterplots, scatterplot matrices, or conditioned plots.
		Honors scalar column attributes 'label' and 'guide' where
		present to produce fully annotated plots using concise syntax.
		Attribute 'guide' is typically units, but may be encoded() to
		provide interpretations of categorical values (see 'encode'
		package).  Utility unpack() transforms scalar column attributes
		to row values and pack() does the reverse, supporting tool-
		neutral storage of metadata along with primary data. Supports
		customizable aesthetics such as such as reference lines, unity
		lines, smooths, log transformation, and linear fits. Compact
		syntax and isolated metadata promote workflow scalability.
