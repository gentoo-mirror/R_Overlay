		Forecasting Long-Term Growth of the U.S. Stock Market and
		Business Cycles // A long-term forecast model called "Jubilee-
		Tectonic model" is implemented to forecast future returns of
		the U.S. stock market, Treasury yield, and gold price. The
		five-factor model forecasts the 10-year and 20-year future
		equity returns with high R-squared above 80 percent. It is
		based on linear growth and mean reversion characteristics in
		the U.S. stock market. This model also enhances the CAPE model
		by introducing the hypothesis that there are fault lines in the
		historical CAPE, which can be calibrated and corrected through
		statistical learning. In addition, it contains a module for
		business cycles, optimal interest rate, and recession
		forecasts.
