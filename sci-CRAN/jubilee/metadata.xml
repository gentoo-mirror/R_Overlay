		Forecasting Long-Term Growth of the U.S. Stock Market // A long-
		term forecast model called "Jubilee-Tectonic model" is
		implemented to forecast future returns of the U.S. stock
		market, Treasury yield, and gold price. The five-factor model
		can forecast the 10-year and 20-year future equity returns with
		high R-squared above 80 percent. It is based on linear growth
		and mean reversion characteristics in the U.S. stock market. In
		addition, this model enhances the CAPE model by introducing the
		hypothesis that there are fault lines in the historical CAPE,
		which can be calibrated and corrected through statistical
		learning.
