		Variational Bayesian Algorithm for Multi-Source Heterogeneous
		Models // A Variational Bayesian algorithm for high-dimensional
		multi-source heterogeneous linear models. More details have
		been written up in a paper submitted to the journal Statistics
		in Medicine, and the details of variational Bayesian methods
		can be found in Ray and Szabo (2021)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1847121. It simultaneously performs
		parameter estimation and variable selection. The algorithm
		supports two model settings: (1) local models, where variable
		selection is only applied to homogeneous coefficients, and (2)
		global models, where variable selection is also performed on
		heterogeneous coefficients. Two forms of Spike-and-Slab priors
		are available: the Laplace distribution and the Gaussian
		distribution as the Slab component.
