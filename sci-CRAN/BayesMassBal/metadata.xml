		Bayesian Data Reconciliation of Separation Processes // Bayesian
		tools that can be used to reconcile, or mass balance, mass flow
		rate data collected from chemical or particulate separation
		processes aided by constraints governed by the conservation of
		mass. Functions included in the package aid the user in
		organizing and constraining data, using Markov chain Monte
		Carlo methods to obtain samples from Bayesian models, and in
		computation of the marginal likelihood of the data, given a
		particular model, for model selection.  Marginal likelihood is
		approximated by methods in Chib S (1995) doi:10.2307/2291521.
