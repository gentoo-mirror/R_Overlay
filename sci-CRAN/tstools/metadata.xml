		A Time Series Toolbox for Official Statistics // Plot official
		statistics' time series conveniently: automatic legends,
		highlight windows, stacked bar chars with positive and negative
		contributions, sum-as-line option, two y-axes with automatic
		horizontal grids that fit both axes and other popular chart
		types. 'tstools' comes with a plethora of defaults to let you
		plot without setting an abundance of parameters first, but
		gives you the flexibility to tweak the defaults. In addition to
		charts, 'tstools' provides a super fast, 'data.table' backed
		time series I/O that allows the user to export / import long
		format, wide format and transposed wide format data to various
		file types.
