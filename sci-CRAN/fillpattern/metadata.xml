		Patterned Fills for 'ggplot2' and 'grid' Graphics // Adds
		distinctive yet unobtrusive geometric patterns where solid
		color fills are normally used. Patterned figures look just as
		professional when viewed by colorblind readers or when printed
		in black and white. The dozen included patterns can be
		customized in terms of scale, rotation, color, fill, line type,
		and line width. Compatible with the 'ggplot2' package as well
		as 'grid' graphics.
