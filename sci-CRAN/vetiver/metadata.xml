		Version, Share, Deploy, and Monitor Models // The goal of
		'vetiver' is to provide fluent tooling to version, share,
		deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both
		recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and
		predicting from a remote API endpoint. The 'vetiver' package is
		extensible, with generics that can support many kinds of
		models.
