		Time Delay Spatio Temporal Neural Network // STARMA (Space-Time
		Autoregressive Moving Average) models are commonly utilized in
		modeling and forecasting spatiotemporal time series data.
		However, the intricate nonlinear dynamics observed in many
		space-time rainfall patterns often exceed the capabilities of
		conventional STARMA models. This R package enables the fitting
		of Time Delay Spatio-Temporal Neural Networks, which are adept
		at handling such complex nonlinear dynamics efficiently. For
		detailed methodology, please refer to Saha et al. (2020)
