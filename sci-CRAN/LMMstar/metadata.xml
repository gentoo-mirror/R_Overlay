		Repeated Measurement Models for Discrete Times // Companion R
		package for the course "Statistical analysis of correlated and
		repeated measurements for health science researchers" taught by
		the section of Biostatistics of the University of Copenhagen.
		It implements linear mixed models where the model for the
		variance-covariance of the residuals is specified via patterns
		(compound symmetry, toeplitz, unstructured, ...). Statistical
		inference for mean, variance, and correlation parameters is
		performed based on the observed information and a Satterthwaite
		approximation of the degrees of freedom. Normalized residuals
		are provided to assess model misspecification. Statistical
		inference can be performed for arbitrary linear or non-linear
		combination(s) of model coefficients. Predictions can be
		computed conditional to covariates only or also to outcome
		values.
