		Bayesian Lasso Regression and Tools for the Lasso Distribution //
		Implements Bayesian Lasso regression using efficient Gibbs
		sampling algorithms, including modified versions of the Hans
		and ParkCasella (PC) samplers. Includes functions for working
		with the Lasso distribution, such as its density, cumulative
		distribution, quantile, and random generation functions, along
		with moment calculations. Also includes a function to compute
		the Mills ratio. Designed for sparse linear models and suitable
		for high-dimensional regression problems.
