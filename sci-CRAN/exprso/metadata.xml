		Rapid Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Genomic
		Data // Supervised machine learning has an increasingly
		important role in data analysis. This package introduces a
		framework for rapidly implementing supervised machine learning
		in a high-throughput manner. This package provides a user-
		friendly interface that empowers investigators to execute
		state-of-the-art binary and multi-class classification,
		including deep learning, with minimal programming experience
		necessary.
