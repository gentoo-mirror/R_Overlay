		High-Dimensional Spatial Covariate-Augmented Overdispersed
		Poisson Factor Model // A spatial covariate-augmented
		overdispersed Poisson factor model is proposed to perform
		efficient latent representation learning method for high-
		dimensional large-scale spatial count data with additional
		covariates.
