		Like Set Tools in 'Base' Package but Keeps Duplicate Elements //
		The 'base'  tools  union() intersect(), etc.,  follow the
		algebraic definition that each element of a set must be unique.
		Since it's often helpful to compare all elements of two
		vectors, this toolset treats every element as unique for
		counting purposes. For ease of use, all functions in vecsets
		have an argument 'multiple' which, when set to FALSE, reverts
		them to the base::sets (alias for all the items) tools
		functionality.
