		Multiplicative Activation // Provides methods and classes for
		adding m-activation ("multiplicative activation") layers to MLR
		or multivariate logistic regression models.  M-activation
		layers created in this library detect and add input interaction
		(polynomial) effects into a predictive model.  M-activation can
		detect high-order interactions -- a traditionally non-trivial
		challenge.  Details concerning application, methodology, and
		relevant survey literature can be found in this library's
		vignette, "About."
