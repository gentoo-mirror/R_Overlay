		Treatment Effects with Multiple Periods and Groups // The
		standard Difference-in-Differences (DID) setup involves two
		periods and two groups -- a treated group and untreated group.
		Many applications of DID methods involve more than two periods
		and have individuals that are treated at different points in
		time.  This package contains tools for computing average
		treatment effect parameters in Difference in Differences setups
		with more than two periods and with variation in treatment
		timing using the methods developed in Callaway and Sant'Anna
		(2020) https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3148250.  The main
		parameters are group-time average treatment effects which are
		the average treatment effect for a particular group at a a
		particular time.  These can be aggregated into a fewer number
		of treatment effect parameters, and the package deals with the
		cases where there is selective treatment timing, dynamic
		treatment effects, calendar time effects, or combinations of
		these.  There are also functions for testing the Difference in
		Differences assumption, and plotting group-time average
		treatment effects.
