		The Double-Gap Life Expectancy Forecasting Model // Life
		expectancy is highly correlated over time among countries and
		between males and females. These associations can be used to
		improve forecasts. Here we have implemented a method for
		forecasting female life expectancy based on analysis of the gap
		between female life expectancy in a country compared with the
		record level of female life expectancy in the world. Second, to
		forecast male life expectancy, the gap between male life
		expectancy and female life expectancy in a country is analysed.
		We named this method the Double-Gap model. For a detailed
		description of the method see Pascariu et al. (2017).
