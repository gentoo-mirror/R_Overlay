		Provides Templates for Metadata Files Associated with Species
		Range Models // Range Modeling Metadata Standards (RMMS)
		address three challenges: they (i) are designed for convenience
		to encourage use, (ii) accommodate a wide variety of
		applications, and (iii) are extensible to allow the community
		of range modelers to steer it as needed. RMMS are based on a
		data dictionary that specifies a hierarchical structure to
		catalog different aspects of the range modeling process. The
		dictionary balances a constrained, minimalist vocabulary to
		improve standardization with flexibility for users to provide
		their own values. Associated manuscript in review.
