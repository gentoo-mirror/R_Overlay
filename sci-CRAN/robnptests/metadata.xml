		Robust Nonparametric Two-Sample Tests for Location/Scale //
		Implementations of several robust nonparametric two-sample
		tests for location or scale differences. The test statistics
		are based on robust location and scale estimators, e.g. the
		sample median or the Hodges-Lehmann estimators as described in
		Fried  Dehling (2011) doi:10.1007/s10260-011-0164-1. The
		p-values can be computed via the permutation principle, the
		randomization principle, or by using the asymptotic
		distributions of the test statistics under the null hypothesis,
		which ensures (approximate) distribution independence of the
		test decision. To test for a difference in scale, we apply the
		tests for location difference to transformed observations; see
		Fried (2012) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2011.02.012. Random noise on a
		small range can be added to the original observations in order
		to hold the significance level on data from discrete
		distributions. The location tests assume homoscedasticity and
		the scale tests require the location parameters to be zero.
