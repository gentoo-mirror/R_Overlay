		Microclimatic Data Processing // Handling the microclimatic data
		in R. The 'myClim' workflow begins at the reading data primary
		from microclimatic dataloggers, but can be also reading of
		meteorological station data from files. Cleaning time step,
		time zone settings and metadata collecting is the next step of
		the work flow. With 'myClim' tools one can crop, join,
		downscale, and convert microclimatic data formats, sort them
		into localities, request descriptive characteristics and
		compute microclimatic variables. Handy plotting functions are
		provided with smart defaults.
