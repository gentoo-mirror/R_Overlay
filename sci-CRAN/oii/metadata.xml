		Crosstab and Statistical Tests for OII MSc Stats Course //
		Provides simple crosstab output with optional statistics (e.g.,
		Goodman-Kruskal Gamma, Somers' d, and Kendall's tau-b) as well
		as two-way and one-way tables. The package is used within the
		statistics component of the Masters of Science (MSc) in Social
		Science of the Internet at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII),
		University of Oxford, but the functions should be useful for
		general data analysis and especially for analysis of
		categorical and ordinal data.
