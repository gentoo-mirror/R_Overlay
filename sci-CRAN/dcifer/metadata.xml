		Genetic Relatedness Between Polyclonal Infections // An
		implementation of Dcifer (Distance for complex infections: fast
		estimation of relatedness), an identity by descent (IBD) based
		method to calculate genetic relatedness between polyclonal
		infections from biallelic and multiallelic data. The package
		includes functions that format and preprocess the data,
		implement the method, and visualize the results. Gerlovina et
		al. (2022) doi:10.1101/2022.04.14.488406.
