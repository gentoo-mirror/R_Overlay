		Simulation Framework // A general framework for statistical
		simulation, which allows researchers to make use of a wide
		range of simulation designs with minimal programming effort.
		The package provides functionality for drawing samples from a
		distribution or a finite population, for adding outliers and
		missing values, as well as for visualization of the simulation
		results.  It follows a clear object-oriented design and
		supports parallel computing to increase computational
		performance.
