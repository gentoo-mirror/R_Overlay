		Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature Analysis in R // An
		implementation of Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature Analysis
		(QFASA) in R.  QFASA is a method of estimating the diet
		composition of predators.  The fundamental unit of information
		in QFASA is a fatty acid signature (signature), which is a
		vector of proportions describing the composition of fatty acids
		within lipids. Signature data from at least one predator and
		from samples of all potential prey types are required.
		Calibration coefficients, which adjust for the differential
		metabolism of individual fatty acids by predators, are also
		required. Given those data inputs, a predator signature is
		modeled as a mixture of prey signatures and its diet estimate
		is obtained as the mixture that minimizes a measure of distance
		between the observed and modeled signatures.  A variety of
		estimation options and simulation capabilities are implemented.
		Please refer to the vignette for additional details and
		references.
