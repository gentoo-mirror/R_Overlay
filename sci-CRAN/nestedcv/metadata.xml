		Nested Cross-Validation with 'glmnet' and 'caret' // Implements
		nested k*l-fold cross-validation for lasso and elastic-net
		regularised linear models via the 'glmnet' package and other
		machine learning models via the 'caret' package. Cross-
		validation of 'glmnet' alpha mixing parameter and embedded fast
		filter functions for feature selection are provided. Described
		as double cross-validation by Stone (1977)
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1977.tb01603.x. Also implemented is a
		method using outer CV to measure unbiased model performance
		metrics when fitting Bayesian linear and logistic regression
		shrinkage models using the horseshoe prior over parameters to
		encourage a sparse model as described by Piironen  Vehtari
		(2017) doi:10.1214/17-EJS1337SI.
