		Heuristics for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem in
		Warehouse Layouts // Heuristic methods to solve the routing
		problems in a warehouse management. Package includes several
		heuristics such as the Midpoint, Return, S-Shape and Semi-
		Optimal Heuristics for designation of the pickers route in
		order picking. The heuristics aim to provide the acceptable
		travel distances while considering warehouse layout constraints
		such as aisles and shelves. It also includes implementation of
		the COPRAS (COmplex PRoportional ASsessment) method for
		supporting selection of locations to be visited by the picker
		in shared storage systems. The package is designed to
		facilitate more efficient warehouse routing and logistics
		operations. see: Bartholdi, J. J.,  Hackman, S. T. (2019).
