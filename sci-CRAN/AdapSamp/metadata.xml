		Adaptive Sampling Algorithms // For distributions whose
		probability density functions are log-concave, the adaptive
		rejection sampling algorithm can be used to build envelope
		functions for sampling. For others, we can use the modified
		adaptive rejection sampling algorithm, the concave-convex
		adaptive rejection sampling algorithm and the adaptive slice
		sampling algorithm. So we designed an R package mainly
		including 4 functions: rARS(), rMARS(), rCCARS() and rASS().
		These functions can realize sampling based on the algorithms
		above.
