		Electrochemical Reactions Simulation // Digital simulation of
		electrochemical processes. Each function allows for implicit
		and explicit solution of the differential equation using
		methods like Euler, Backwards implicit, Runge Kutta 4, Crank
		Nicholson and Backward differentiation formula as well as
		different number of points for derivative approximation.
		Several electrochemical processes can be simulated such as:
		Chronoamperometry, Potential Step, Linear Sweep, Cyclic
		Voltammetry, Cyclic Voltammetry with electrochemical reaction
		followed by chemical reaction (EC mechanism) and CV with two
		following electrochemical reaction (EE mechanism). In update
		1.1.0 has been added a general purpose CV function that allow
		to simulate up to 4 EE mechanism combined with chemical
		reaction for each species.Update 1.2.0 improved the accuracy of
		the measurements and allow personalized data resolution for
		simulation. Bibliography regarding this methods can be found in
		the following texts. Dieter Britz, Jorg Strutwolf (2016)
		ISBN:978-3-319-30292-8. Allen J. Bard, Larry R. Faulkner (2000)
