		Electrochemical Simulation Tools // Set of functions for digital
		simulation of electrochemical processes. Each function allows
		for implicit and explicit solution of the differential equation
		using methods like Euler, Backwards implicit, Runge Kutta 4,
		Crank Nicholson and Backward differentiation formula as well as
		different number of points for derivative approximation.
		Several electrochemical processes can be simulated such as:
		Chronoamperometry, Potential Step, Linear Sweep, Cyclic
		Voltammetry, Cyclic Voltammetry with electrochemical reaction
		followed by chemical reaction (EC mechanism) and CV with two
		following electrochemical reaction (EE mechanism). Bibliography
		regarding this methods can be found in the following texts.
		Dieter Britz, Jorg Strutwolf (2016) ISBN:978-3-319-30292-8 .
