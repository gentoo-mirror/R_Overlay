		Marginal Analysis of Misclassified Longitudinal Ordinal Data //
		Three estimating equation methods are provided in this package
		for marginal analysis of longitudinal ordinal data with
		misclassified responses and covariates. The naive analysis
		which is solely based on the observed data without adjustment
		may lead to bias. The corrected generalized estimating
		equations (GEE2) method which is unbiased requires the
		misclassification parameters to be known beforehand. The
		corrected generalized estimating equations (GEE2) with
		validation subsample method estimates the misclassification
		parameters based on a given validation set. This package is an
		implementation of Chen (2013) doi:10.1002/bimj.201200195.
