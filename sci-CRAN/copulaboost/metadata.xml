		Fitting Additive Copula Regression Models for Binary Outcome
		Regression // Additive copula regression for regression
		problems with binary outcome via gradient boosting [Brant, Hobk
		Haff (2022); arXiv:2208.04669]. The fitting process includes a
		specialised model selection algorithm for each component, where
		each component is found (by greedy optimisation) among all the
		D-vines with only Gaussian pair-copulas of a fixed dimension,
		as specified by the user. When the variables and structure have
		been selected, the algorithm then re-fits the component where
		the pair-copula distributions can be different from Gaussian,
		if specified.
