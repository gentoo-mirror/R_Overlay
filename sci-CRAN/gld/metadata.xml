		Estimation and Use of the Generalised (Tukey) Lambda Distribution
		// The generalised lambda distribution, or Tukey lambda
		distribution, provides a wide variety of shapes with one
		functional form. This package provides random numbers,
		quantiles, probabilities, densities and density quantiles for
		four different types of the distribution, the FKML, RS, GPD and
		FM5 - see documentation for details. It provides the density
		function, distribution function, and Quantile-Quantile plots.
		It implements a variety of estimation methods for the
		distribution, including diagnostic plots. Estimation methods
		include the starship (all 4 types), method of L-Moments for the
		GPD and FKML types, and a number of methods for only the FKML
		parameterisation. These include maximum likelihood, maximum
		product of spacings, Titterington's method, Moments, Trimmed
		L-Moments and Distributional Least Absolutes.
