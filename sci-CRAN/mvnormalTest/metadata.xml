		Powerful Tests for Multivariate Normality // A simple informative
		powerful test (mvnTest()) for multivariate normality proposed
		by Zhou and Shao (2014) doi:10.1080/02664763.2013.839637, which
		combines kurtosis with Shapiro-Wilk test that is easy for
		biomedical researchers to understand and easy to implement in
		all dimensions. This package also contains some other
		multivariate normality tests including Fattorini's FA test
		(faTest()), Mardia's skewness and kurtosis test (mardia()),
		Henze-Zirkler's test (mhz()), Bowman and Shenton's test
		(msk()), Roystons H test (msw()), and Villasenor-Alva and
		Gonzalez-Estrada's test (msw()). Empirical power calculation
		functions for these tests are also provided. In addition, this
		package includes some functions to generate several types of
		multivariate distributions mentioned in Zhou and Shao (2014).
