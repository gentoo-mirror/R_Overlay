		Frechet Random Forests // Random forests are a statistical
		learning method widely used in many areas of scientific
		research essentially for its ability to learn complex
		relationships between input and output variables and also its
		capacity to handle high-dimensional data. However, current
		random forests approaches are not flexible enough to handle
		longitudinal data, shapes and images.  In this package, we
		introduce Frchet trees and Frchet random forests, which allow
		to manage data for which input and output can either curves,
		scalars, factors, shapes or images. To this end, a new way of
		splitting the nodes of trees is introduced and the prediction
		procedures of trees and forests are generalized.
