		Package for Brik and Fabrik Algorithms to Initialise Kmeans //
		Implementation of the BRIk and FABRIk algorithms to initialise
		k-means. These methods are intended for the clustering of
		multivariate and functional data, respectively. They make use
		of the Modified Band Depth and bootstrap to identify
		appropriate initial seeds for k-means, which are proven to be
		better options than many techniques in the literature. Torrente
		and Romo (2020) doi:10.1007/s00357-020-09372-3.
