		Package for Brik, Fabrik and Fdebrik Algorithms to Initialise
		Kmeans // Implementation of the BRIk, FABRIk and FDEBRIk
		algorithms to initialise k-means. These methods are intended
		for the clustering of multivariate and functional data,
		respectively. They make use of the Modified Band Depth and
		bootstrap to identify appropriate initial seeds for k-means,
		which are proven to be better options than many techniques in
		the literature. Torrente and Romo (2021)
		doi:10.1007/s00357-020-09372-3 It makes use of the functions
		kma and kma.similarity, from the archived package fdakma, by
		Alice Parodi et al.
