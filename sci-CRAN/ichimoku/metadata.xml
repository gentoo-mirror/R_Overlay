		Compute and Plot Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Cloud Charts // An
		implementation of the 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo' charting system,
		also commonly known as 'cloud charts', providing both
		publication-ready and fully-interactive charts for analysis. As
		described in Sasaki (1996, ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a
		refinement on candlestick charting originating from Japan, now
		in widespread use in technical analysis worldwide. Translating
		to 'one-glance equilibrium chart', it allows the price action
		and market structure of financial securities to be determined
		'at-a-glance'.
