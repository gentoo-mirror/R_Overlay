		Visualization and Tools for Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Strategies // An
		implementation of 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo', also commonly known as
		'cloud charts'. Static and interactive visualizations with
		tools for creating, backtesting and development of quantitative
		'ichimoku' strategies. As described in Sasaki (1996,
		ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a refinement on candlestick
		charting originating from Japan, now in widespread use in
		technical analysis worldwide. Translating as 'one-glance
		equilibrium chart', it allows the price action and market
		structure of financial securities to be determined 'at-a-
		glance'.
