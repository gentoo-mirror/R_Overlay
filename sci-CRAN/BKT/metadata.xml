		Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model // Fitting, cross-validating,
		and predicting with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) models. It
		is designed for analyzing educational datasets to trace student
		knowledge over time. The package includes functions for fitting
		BKT models, evaluating their performance using various metrics,
		and making predictions on new data. It provides the same
		functionality as the Python package pyBKT authored by Bulut et
		al. (2023, doi:10.3390/psych5030050) and pyBKT can be accessed
		via the site at https://github.com/CAHLR/pyBKT.
