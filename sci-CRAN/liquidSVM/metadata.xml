		A Fast and Versatile SVM Package // Support vector machines
		(SVMs) and related kernel-based learning algorithms are a well-
		known class of machine learning algorithms, for non-parametric
		classification and regression. liquidSVM is an implementation
		of SVMs whose key features are: fully integrated hyper-
		parameter selection, extreme speed on both small and large data
		sets, full flexibility for experts, and inclusion of a variety
		of different learning scenarios: multi-class classification,
		ROC, and Neyman-Pearson learning, and least-squares, quantile,
		and expectile regression.
