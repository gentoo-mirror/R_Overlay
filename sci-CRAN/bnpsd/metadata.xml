		Simulate Genotypes from the BN-PSD Admixture Model // The
		Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly (PSD) admixture model has k
		intermediate subpopulations from which n individuals draw their
		alleles dictated by their individual-specific admixture
		proportions.  The BN-PSD model additionally imposes the
		Balding-Nichols (BN) allele frequency model to the intermediate
		populations, which therefore evolved independently from a
		common ancestral population T with subpopulation-specific FST
		(Wright's fixation index) parameters.  The BN-PSD model can be
		used to yield complex population structures.  Method described
		in Ochoa and Storey (2021) doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009241.
