		Spatial Projection of Network Signals along Geodesic Paths // For
		a given graph containing vertices, edges, and a signal
		associated with the vertices, the 'PathwaySpace' package
		performs a convolution operation, which involves a weighted
		combination of neighboring vertices and their associated
		signals. The package then uses a decay function to project
		these signals, creating geodesic paths on a 2D-image space.
		'PathwaySpace' could have various applications, such as
		visualizing and analyzing network data in a graphical format
		that highlights the relationships and signal strengths between
		vertices. It can be particularly useful for understanding the
		influence of signals through complex networks. By combining
		graph theory, signal processing, and visualization, the
		'PathwaySpace' package provides a novel way of representing and
		analyzing graph data.
