		Regression using GMDH Algorithms // Regression using GMDH
		algorithms from Prof. Alexey G. Ivakhnenko. Group Method of
		Data Handling (GMDH), or polynomial neural networks, is a
		family of inductive algorithms that performs gradually
		complicated polynomial models and selecting the best solution
		by an external criterion. In other words, inductive GMDH
		algorithms give possibility finding automatically
		interrelations in data, and selecting an optimal structure of
		model or network. The package includes GMDH Combinatorial, and
		GMDH MIA (Multilayered Iterative Algorithm) using PRESS
		(Predicted Residual Error Sum of Squares Statistic) criteria.
		It is calculated as the sums of squares of the prediction
		residuals for those observations. An introduction of GMDH
		algorithms: Farlow, S.J. (1981): "The GMDH algorithm of
		Ivakhnenko", The American Statistician, 35(4), pp. 210-215.
		doi:10.2307/2683292 Ivakhnenko A.G. (1968): "The Group Method
		of Data Handling - A Rival of the Method of Stochastic
		Approximation", Soviet Automatic Control, 13(3), pp. 43-55.
