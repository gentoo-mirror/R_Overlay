		Regression using GMDH Algorithms // Regression using GMDH
		algorithms from Prof. Alexey G. Ivakhnenko. Group Method of
		Data Handling (GMDH), or polynomial neural networks, is a
		family of inductive algorithms that performs gradually
		complicated polynomial models and selecting the best solution
		by an external criterion. In other words, inductive GMDH
		algorithms give possibility finding automatically
		interrelations in data, and selecting an optimal structure of
		model or network. The package includes GMDH Combinatorial, GMDH
		MIA (Multilayered Iterative Algorithm), GMDH GIA (Generalized
		Iterative Algorithm) and GMDH Combinatorial with Active
		Neurons.
