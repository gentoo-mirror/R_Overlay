		Fit Regularization Path for Generalized Additive Models // Using
		overlap grouped-lasso penalties, 'gamsel' selects whether a
		term in a 'gam' is nonzero, linear, or a non-linear spline (up
		to a specified max df per variable). It fits the entire
		regularization path on a grid of values for the overall penalty
		lambda, both for gaussian and binomial families.
