		Latent Order Logistic Graph Models // Estimation of Latent Order
		Logistic (LOLOG) Models for Networks. LOLOGs are a flexible and
		fully general class of statistical graph models. This package
		provides functions for performing MOM, GMM and variational
		inference. Visual diagnostics and goodness of fit metrics are
		provided. See Fellows (2018) doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.04583 for
