		Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) // The development of ISM
		was made by Warfield in 1974. ISM is the process of
		collaborating distinct or related essentials into a simplified
		and an organized format. Hence, ISM is a methodology that seeks
		the interrelationships among the various elements considered
		and endows with a hierarchical and multilevel structure. To run
		this package user needs to provide a matrix (VAXO) converted
		into 0's and 1's. Warfield,J.N. (1974)
