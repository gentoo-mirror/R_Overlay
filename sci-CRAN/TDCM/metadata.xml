		The Transition Diagnostic Classification Model Framework //
		Estimate the transition diagnostic classification model (TDCM)
		described in Madison  Bradshaw (2018)
		doi:10.1007/s11336-018-9638-5, a longitudinal extension of the
		log-linear cognitive diagnosis model (LCDM) in Henson, Templin
		Willse (2009) doi:10.1007/s11336-008-9089-5. As the LCDM
		subsumes many other diagnostic classification models (DCMs),
		many other DCMs can be estimated longitudinally via the TDCM.
		The 'TDCM' package includes functions to estimate the single-
		group and multigroup TDCM, summarize results of interest
		including item parameters, growth proportions, transition
		probabilities, transitional reliability, attribute
		correlations, model fit, and growth plots.
