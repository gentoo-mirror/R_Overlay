		Construct Mixed Type Data Structures with Vectors of Vectors //
		Mixed type vectors are useful for combining semantically
		similar classes. Some examples of semantically related classes
		include time across different granularities (e.g. daily,
		monthly, annual) and probability distributions (e.g. Normal,
		Uniform, Poisson). These groups of vector types typically share
		common statistical operations which vary in results with the
		attributes of each vector. The 'vecvec' data structure
		facilitates efficient storage and computation across multiple
		vectors within the same object.
