		Use Time Series to Generate and Compare Power Spectral Density //
		Functions that allow you to generate and compare power spectral
		density (PSD) plots given time series data. Fast Fourier
		Transform (FFT) is used to take a time series data, analyze the
		oscillations, and then output the frequencies of these
		oscillations in the time series in the form of a PSD plot.Thus
		given a time series, the dominant frequencies in the time
		series can be identified. Additional functions in this package
		allow the dominant frequencies of multiple groups of time
		series to be compared with each other. To see example usage
		with the main functions of this package, please visit this
		site: https://yhhc2.github.io/psdr/articles/Introduction.html.
		The mathematical operations used to generate the PSDs are
		described in these sites:
