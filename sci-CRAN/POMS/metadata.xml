		Phylogenetic Organization of Metagenomic Signals // Code to
		identify functional enrichments across diverse taxa in
		phylogenetic tree, particularly where these taxa differ in
		abundance across samples in a non-random pattern. The
		motivation for this approach is to identify microbial functions
		encoded by diverse taxa that are at higher abundance in certain
		samples compared to others, which could indicate that such
		functions are broadly adaptive under certain conditions. See
		'GitHub' repository for tutorial and examples:
