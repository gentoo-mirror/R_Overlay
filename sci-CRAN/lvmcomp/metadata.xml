		Stochastic EM Algorithms for Latent Variable Models with a High-
		Dimensional Latent Space // Provides stochastic EM algorithms
		for latent variable models with a high-dimensional latent
		space. So far, we provide functions for confirmatory item
		factor analysis based on the multidimensional two parameter
		logistic (M2PL) model and the generalized multidimensional
		partial credit model. These functions scale well for problems
		with many latent traits (e.g., thirty or even more) and are
		virtually tuning-free. The computation is facilitated by
		multiprocessing 'OpenMP' API. For more information, please
		refer to: Zhang, S., Chen, Y.,  Liu, Y. (2018). An Improved
		Stochastic EM Algorithm for Large-scale Full-information Item
		Factor Analysis. British Journal of Mathematical and
		Statistical Psychology. doi:10.1111/bmsp.12153.
