		Statistical Methods for Anthropometric Data // Statistical
		methodologies especially developed to analyze anthropometric
		data. These methods are aimed           at providing effective
		solutions to some commons problems related to Ergonomics and
		Anthropometry. They are based on clustering, the
		statistical concept of data depth, statistical shape analysis
		and archetypal analysis. Please see Vinue (2017)
