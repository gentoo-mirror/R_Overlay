		Clean and Analyze Continuous Glucose Monitor Data // This code
		provides several different functions for cleaning and analyzing
		continuous glucose monitor data. Currently it works with
		'Dexcom' (https://www.dexcom.com) or 'iPro 2'
		(http://professional.medtronicdiabetes.com/ipro2-professional-
		cgm) data. The makecsv() function can convert files to CSV if
		they have been saved as 'Excel' documents. The cleaniprodata()
		and cleandexcomdata() functions take a directory of CGM data
		files and clean them for analysis. Finally, cgmvariables()
		iterates through a directory of cleaned CGM data files and
		produces a single spreadsheet with data for each file. This
		spreadsheet is compatible with REDCap data upload ("--1" is
		added to each subject ID automatically for double data entry).
