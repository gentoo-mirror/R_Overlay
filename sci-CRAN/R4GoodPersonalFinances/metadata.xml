		Make Optimal Financial Decisions // Make optimal decisions for
		your personal or household finances. Use tools and methods that
		are selected carefully to align with academic consensus,
		bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical
		application. They help you find your own personalized optimal
		discretionary spending or optimal asset allocation, and prepare
		you for retirement or financial independence. The optimal
		solution to this problems is extremely complex, and we only
		have a single lifetime to get it right. Fortunately, we now
		have the user-friendly tools implemented, that integrate life-
		cycle models with single-period net-worth mean-variance
		optimization models. Those tools can be used by anyone who
		wants to see what highly-personalized optimal decisions can
		look like. For more details see: Idzorek T., Kaplan P. (2024,
