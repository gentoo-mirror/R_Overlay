		Motif-Based Spectral Clustering of Weighted Directed Networks //
		Tools for spectral clustering of weighted directed networks
		using motif adjacency matrices. Methods perform well on large
		and sparse networks, and random sampling methods for generating
		weighted directed networks are also provided. Based on
		methodology detailed in Underwood, Elliott and Cucuringu (2020)
		arXiv:2004.01293.
