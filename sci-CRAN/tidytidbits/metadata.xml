		selection of various tools to extend a data analysis workflow
		based on the 'tidyverse' packages. This includes high-level

		'mutate'/'mutate_at'), some methods in the style of 'purrr' and
		'forcats', 'lookup' methods for dict-like lists, a generic
		method for lumping a data frame by a given count, various low-
		level methods for special treatment of 'NA' values,
		'python'-style tuple-assignment and 'truthy'/'falsy' checks,
		saving to PDF and PNG from a pipe and various small utilities.
