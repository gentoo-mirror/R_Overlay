		Paste Box Input for 'Shiny' // Provides a 'Shiny' input widget,
		pasteBoxInput, that allows users to paste images directly into
		a 'Shiny' application. The pasted images are captured as Base64
		encoded strings and can be used within the application for
		various purposes, such as display or further processing. This
		package is particularly useful for applications that require
		easy and quick image uploads without the need for traditional
		file selection dialog boxes.
