		Simulation of the Growth of Framboidal and Sunflower Pyrite //
		Generation of theoretical size distributions of framboidal or
		sunflower pyrite. The growth mechanisms used are surface and
		supply controlled and dependent or independent of size. The
		algorithms are fully described in the published work in
		Mineralogy and Petrology journal: "Theoretical growth of
		framboidal and sunflower pyrite using the R-package
		frambgrowth" The authors Merinero, R., and Cardenes, V. (2018).
