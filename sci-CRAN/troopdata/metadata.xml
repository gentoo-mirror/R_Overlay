		Tools for Analyzing Cross-National Military Deployment and Basing
		Data // These functions generate data frames on troop
		deployments and military basing using U.S. Department of
		Defense data on overseas military deployments initially
		compiled by Kane (2012) and Vine (2015) and subsequently
		updated by Allen, Flynn, Martinez Machain, and Stravers (2020).
		This package provides functions for pulling country-year troop
		deployment and basing data. Subsequent versions will hopefully
		include cross-national data on deploying countries.
