		Tools for Analyzing Cross-National Military Deployment and Basing
		Data // These functions generate data frames on troop
		deployments and military basing using U.S. Department of
		Defense data on overseas military deployments. This package
		provides functions for pulling country-year troop deployment
		and basing data. Subsequent versions will hopefully include
		cross-national data on deploying countries.
