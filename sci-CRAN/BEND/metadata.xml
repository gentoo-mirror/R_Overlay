		Bayesian Estimation of Nonlinear Data (BEND) // Provides a set of
		models to estimate nonlinear longitudinal data using Bayesian
		estimation methods. These models include the: 1) Bayesian
		Piecewise Random Effects Model (Bayes_PREM()) which estimates a
		piecewise random effects (mixture) model for a given number of
		latent classes and a latent number of possible changepoints in
		each class, and can incorporate class and outcome predictive
		covariates (see Lamm (2022) https://hdl.handle.net/11299/252533
		and Lock et al., (2018) doi:10.1007/s11336-017-9594-5), 2)
		Bayesian Crossed Random Effects Model (Bayes_CREM()) which
		estimates a linear, quadratic, exponential, or piecewise
		crossed random effects models where individuals are changing
		groups over time (e.g., students and schools; see Rohloff et
		al., (2024) doi:10.1111/bmsp.12334), and 3) Bayesian Bivariate
		Piecewise Random Effects Model (Bayes_BPREM()) which estimates
		a bivariate piecewise random effects model to jointly model two
		related outcomes (e.g., reading and math achievement; see
		Peralta et al., (2022) doi:10.1037/met0000358).
