		Real-Time PCR Data Sets by Boggy et al. (2010) // Real-time
		quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data sets by
		Boggy et al. (2008) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012355. This
		package provides a dilution series for one PCR target: a random
		sequence that minimizes secondary structure and off-target
		primer binding. The data set is a six-point, ten-fold dilution
		series. For each concentration there are two replicates. Each
		amplification curve is 40 cycles long. Original raw data file:
