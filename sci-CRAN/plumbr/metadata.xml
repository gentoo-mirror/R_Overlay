		Mutable and Dynamic Data Models // The base R data.frame, like
		any vector, is copied upon modification. This behavior is at
		odds with that of GUIs and interactive graphics. To rectify
		this, plumbr provides a mutable, dynamic tabular data model.
		Models may be chained together to form the complex plumbing
		necessary for sophisticated graphical interfaces. Also included
		is a general framework for linking datasets; an typical use
		case would be a linked brush.
