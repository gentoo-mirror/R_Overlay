		Estimate Invasive and Alien Species (IAS) Introduction Rates //
		Easily estimate the introduction rates of alien species given
		first records data. It specializes in addressing the role of
		sampling on the pattern of discoveries, thus providing better
		estimates than using Generalized Linear Models which assume
		perfect immediate detection of newly introduced species.
