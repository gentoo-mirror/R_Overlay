		Optimal Transport for Gating Transfer in Cytometry Data with
		Domain Adaptation // Supervised learning from a source
		distribution (with known segmentation into cell sub-
		populations) to fit a target distribution with unknown
		segmentation. It relies regularized optimal transport to
		directly estimate the different cell population proportions
		from a biological sample characterized with flow cytometry
		measurements. It is based on the regularized Wasserstein metric
		to compare cytometry measurements from different samples, thus
		accounting for possible mis-alignment of a given cell
		population across sample (due to technical variability from the
		technology of measurements). Supervised learning technique
		based on the Wasserstein metric that is used to estimate an
		optimal re-weighting of class proportions in a mixture model
		Details are presented in Freulon P, Bigot J and Hejblum BP
		(2021) arXiv:2006.09003.
