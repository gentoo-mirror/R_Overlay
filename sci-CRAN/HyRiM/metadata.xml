		Multicriteria Risk Management using Zero-Sum Games with Vector-
		Valued Payoffs that are Probability Distributions //
		Construction and analysis of multivalued zero-sum matrix games
		over the abstract space of probability distributions, which
		describe the losses in each scenario of defense vs. attack
		action. The distributions can be compiled directly from expert
		opinions or other empirical data (insofar available). The
		package implements the methods put forth in the EU project
		HyRiM (Hybrid Risk Management for Utility Networks), FP7 EU
		Project Number 608090.
