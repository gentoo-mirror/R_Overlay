		Multicriteria Risk Management using Zero-Sum Games with Vector-
		Valued Payoffs that are Probability Distributions //
		Construction and analysis of multivalued zero-sum matrix games
		over the abstract space of probability distributions, which
		describe the losses in each scenario of defense vs. attack
		action. The distributions can be compiled directly from expert
		opinions or other empirical data (insofar available). The
		package implements the methods put forth in the EU project
		HyRiM (Hybrid Risk Management for Utility Networks), FP7 EU
		Project Number 608090. The method has been published in Rass,
		S., Knig, S., Schauer, S., 2016. Decisions with Uncertain
		Consequences-A Total Ordering on Loss-Distributions. PLoS ONE
		11, e0168583. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0168583, and applied for
		advanced persistent thread modeling in Rass, S., Knig, S.,
		Schauer, S., 2017. Defending Against Advanced Persistent
		Threats Using Game-Theory. PLoS ONE 12, e0168675.
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0168675. A volume covering the wider
		range of aspects of risk management, partially based on the
		theory implemented in the package is the book edited by S. Rass
		and S. Schauer, 2018. Game Theory for Security and Risk
		Management: From Theory to Practice. Springer,
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6, ISBN 978-3-319-75267-9.
