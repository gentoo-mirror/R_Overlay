		Efficient Visualization of Regression Coefficients for Lm(),
		Glm(), and Glmnet() Objects // The visualization tool offers a
		nuanced understanding of regression dynamics, going beyond
		traditional per-unit interpretation of continuous variables
		versus categorical ones. It highlights the impact of unit
		changes as well as larger shifts like interquartile changes,
		acknowledging the distribution of empirical data. Furthermore,
		it generates visualizations depicting alterations in Odds
		Ratios for predictors across minimum, first quartile, median,
		third quartile, and maximum values, aiding in comprehending
		predictor-outcome interplay within empirical data
		distributions, particularly in logistic regression frameworks.
