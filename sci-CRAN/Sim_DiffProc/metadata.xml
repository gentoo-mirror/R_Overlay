		Simulation of Diffusion Processes // A package for symbolic and
		numerical computations on scalar and multivariate systems of
		stochastic differential equations. It provides users with a
		wide range of tools to simulate, estimate, analyze, and
		visualize the dynamics of these systems in both forms It and
		Stratonovich. Statistical analysis with Parallel Monte-Carlo
		and moment equations methods of SDE's. Enabled many searchers
		in different domains to use these equations to modeling
		practical problems in financial and actuarial modeling and
		other areas of application, e.g., modeling and simulate of
		first passage time problem in shallow water using the
		attractive center (Boukhetala K, 1996).
