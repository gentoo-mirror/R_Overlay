		Simulation of Diffusion Processes // It provides users with a
		wide range of tools to simulate, estimate, analyze, and
		visualize the dynamics of stochastic differential systems in
		both forms Ito and Stratonovich. Statistical analysis with
		parallel Monte Carlo and moment equations methods of SDEs
		doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i02. Enabled many searchers in different
		domains to use these equations to modeling practical problems
		in financial and actuarial modeling and other areas of
		application, e.g., modeling and simulate of first passage time
		problem in shallow water using the attractive center
