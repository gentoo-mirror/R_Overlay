		Monotonic Optimal Binning // Generate the monotonic binning and
		perform the woe (weight of evidence) transformation for the
		logistic regression used in the consumer credit scorecard
		development. The woe transformation is a piecewise
		transformation that is linear to the log odds. For a numeric
		variable, all of its monotonic functional transformations will
		converge to the same woe transformation.
