		Quantifies Effects of Geo/Eco Distance on Genetic Differentiation
		// Provides functions that allow users to quantify the relative
		contributions of geographic and ecological distances to
		empirical patterns of genetic differentiation on a landscape.
		Specifically, we use a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		algorithm, which is used to estimate the parameters of the
		inference model, as well as functions for performing MCMC
		diagnosis and assessing model adequacy.
