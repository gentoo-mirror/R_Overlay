		Create a Segmented Total Bar Plot with Custom Annotations and
		Labels // It provides a better alternative for stacked bar plot
		by creating a segmented total bar plot with custom annotations
		and labels. It is useful for visualizing the total of a
		variable and its segments in a single bar, making it easier to
		compare the segments and their contributions to the total.
