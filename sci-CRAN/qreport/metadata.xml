		Statistical Reporting with 'Quarto' // Provides statistical
		components, tables, and graphs that are useful in 'Quarto' and
		'RMarkdown' reports and that produce 'Quarto' elements for
		special formatting such as tabs and marginal notes and graphs.
		Some of the functions produce entire report sections with tabs,
		e.g., the missing data report created by missChk().  Functions
		for inserting variables and tables inside 'graphviz' and
		'mermaid' diagrams are included, and so are special clinical
		trial graphics for adverse event reporting.
