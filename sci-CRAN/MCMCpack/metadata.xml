		Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Package // Contains functions to
		perform Bayesian inference using posterior simulation for a
		number of statistical models. Most simulation is done in
		compiled C++ written in the Scythe Statistical Library Version
		1.0.3. All models return coda mcmc objects that can then be
		summarized using the coda package. Some useful utility
		functions such as density functions, pseudo-random number
		generators for statistical distributions, a general purpose
		Metropolis sampling algorithm, and tools for visualization are
		provided.
