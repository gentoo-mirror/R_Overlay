		Regression Analysis for Very Large Data Sets via Merge and Reduce
		// Frequentist and Bayesian linear regression for large data
		sets. Useful when the data does not fit into memory (for both
		frequentist and Bayesian regression), to make running time
		manageable (mainly for Bayesian regression), and to reduce the
		total running time because of reduced or less severe memory-
		spillover into the virtual memory. This is an implementation of
		Merge  Reduce for linear regression as described in Geppert,
		L.N., Ickstadt, K., Munteanu, A.,  Sohler, C. (2020).
