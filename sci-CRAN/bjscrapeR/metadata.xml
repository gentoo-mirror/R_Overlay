		An API Wrapper for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) //
		Drawing heavy influence from 'blscrapeR', this package scrapes
		crime data from https://www.bjs.gov/. Specifically, it scrapes
		data from the National Crime Victimization Survey which tracks
		personal and household crime in the USA. The idea is to utilize
		the 'tidyverse' methodology to create an efficient work flow
		when dealing with crime statistics.
