		Piecewise Structural Equation Modelling // Conduct dsep tests
		(piecewise SEM) of a directed, or mixed, acyclic graph without
		latent variables (but possibly with implicitly marginalized or
		conditioned latent variables that create dependent errors)
		based on linear, generalized linear, or additive modelswith or
		without a nesting structure for the data. Also included are
		functions to do desp tests step-by-step,exploratory path
		analysis, and Monte Carlo X2 probabilities. This package
		accompanies Shipley, B, (2026).Cause and Correlation in
		Biology: A User's Guide to Path Analysis, StructuralEquations
		and Causal Inference (3rd edition).  Cambridge University
