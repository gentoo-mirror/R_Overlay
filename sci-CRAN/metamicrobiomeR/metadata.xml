		Analysis of Microbiome Relative Abundance Data using Zero
		Inflated Beta GAMLSS and Meta-Analysis Across Studies using
		Random Effects Model // Generalized Additive Model for
		Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) with zero inflated beta
		(BEZI) family for analysis of microbiome relative abundance
		data (with various options for data
		transformation/normalization to address compositional effects)
		and random effects meta-analysis models for meta-analysis
		pooling estimates across microbiome studies are implemented.
		Random Forest model to predict microbiome age based on relative
		abundances of shared bacterial genera with the Bangladesh data
		(Subramanian et al 2014), comparison of multiple diversity
		indexes using linear/linear mixed effect models and some data
		display/visualization are also implemented. The reference paper
		is published by Ho NT, Li F, Wang S, Kuhn L (2019)
		doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2744-2 .
