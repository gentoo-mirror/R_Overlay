		A Pipeline Toolkit for Reproducible Computation at Scale // A
		general-purpose computational engine for data analysis, drake
		rebuilds intermediate data objects when their dependencies
		change, and it skips work when the results are already up to
		date. Not every execution starts from scratch, and completed
		projects have tangible evidence that they are reproducible.
		Extensive documentation, from beginner-friendly tutorials to
		practical examples and more, is available at the reference
		website https://ropensci.github.io/drake/ and the online manual
		https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/.
