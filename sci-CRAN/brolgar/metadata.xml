		Browse Over Longitudinal Data Graphically and Analytically in R
		// Provides a framework of tools to summarise, visualise, and
		explore longitudinal data. It builds upon the tidy time series
		data frames used in the 'tsibble' package, and is designed to
		integrate within the 'tidyverse', and 'tidyverts' (for time
		series) ecosystems. The methods implemented include calculating
		features for understanding longitudinal data, including
		calculating summary statistics such as quantiles, medians, and
		numeric ranges, sampling individual series, identifying
		individual series representative of a group, and extending the
		facet system  in 'ggplot2' to facilitate exploration of samples
		of data. These methods are fully described in the paper
		"brolgar: An R package to Browse Over Longitudinal Data
		Graphically and Analytically in R", Nicholas Tierney, Dianne
		Cook, Tania Prvan (2020) arXiv:2012.01619.
