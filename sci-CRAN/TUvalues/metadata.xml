		Tools for Calculating Allocations in Game Theory using Exact and
		Approximated Methods // The main objective of cooperative games
		is to allocate a good among the agents involved. This package
		includes the most well-known   allocation rules, i.e., the
		Shapley value, the Banzhaf value, the egalitarian rule, and the
		equal surplus division value. In addition, it considers the
		point of view of a priori unions (situations in which agents
		can form coalitions). For this purpose, the package includes
		the Owen value, the Banzhaf-Owen value, and the corresponding
		extensions of the egalitarian rules. All these values can be
		calculated exactly or estimated by sampling.
