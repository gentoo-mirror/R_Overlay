		Kernel Density Estimation with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sample
		// Provides methods for selecting the optimal bandwidth in
		kernel density estimation for dependent samples, such as those
		generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Implements a
		modified biased cross-validation (mBCV) approach that accounts
		for sample dependence, improving the accuracy of estimated
		density functions.
