		Standardization-Based Effect Estimation with Optional Prior
		Covariance Adjustment // The Prognostic Regression Offsets with
		Propagation of ERrors (for Treatment Effect Estimation) package
		facilitates direct adjustment for experiments and observational
		studies that is compatible with a range of study designs and
		covariance adjustment strategies. It uses explicit
		specification of clusters, blocks and treatment allocations to
		furnish probability of assignment-based weights targeting any
		of several average treatment effect parameters, and for
		standard error calculations reflecting these design parameters.
		For covariance adjustment of its Hajek and (one-way) fixed
		effects estimates, it enables offsetting the outcome against
		predictions from a dedicated covariance model, with standard
		error calculations propagating error as appropriate from the
		covariance model.
