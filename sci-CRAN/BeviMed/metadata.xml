		Bayesian Evaluation of Variant Involvement in Mendelian Disease
		// A fast integrative genetic association test for rare
		diseases based on a model for disease status given allele
		counts at rare variant sites. Probability of association, mode
		of inheritance and probability of pathogenicity for individual
		variants are all inferred in a Bayesian framework - 'A Fast
		Association Test for Identifying Pathogenic Variants Involved
		in Rare Diseases', Greene et al 2017
