		Bivariate Probit with Partial Observability // A suite of
		functions to estimate, summarize and perform predictions with
		the bivariate probit subject to partial observability. The
		frequentist and Bayesian probabilistic philosophies are both
		supported. The frequentist method is estimated with maximum
		likelihood and the Bayesian method is estimated with a Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm developed by Rajbanhdari, A
