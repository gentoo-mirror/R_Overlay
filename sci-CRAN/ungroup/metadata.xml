		Penalized Composite Link Model for Efficient Estimation of Smooth
		Distributions from Coarsely Binned Data // Versatile method for
		ungrouping histograms (binned count data) assuming that counts
		are Poisson distributed and that the underlying sequence on a
		fine grid to be estimated is smooth. The method is based on the
		composite link model and estimation is achieved by maximizing a
		penalized likelihood. Smooth detailed sequences of counts and
		rates are so estimated from the binned counts. Ungrouping
		binned data can be desirable for many reasons: Bins can be too
		coarse to allow for accurate analysis; comparisons can be
		hindered when different grouping approaches are used in
		different histograms; and the last interval is often wide and
		open-ended and, thus, covers a lot of information in the tail
		area. Age-at-death distributions grouped in age classes and
		abridged life tables are examples of binned data. Because of
		modest assumptions, the approach is suitable for many
		demographic and epidemiological applications. For a detailed
		description of the method and applications see Rizzi et al.
