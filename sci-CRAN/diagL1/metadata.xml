		Routines for Fit, Inference and Diagnostics in Linear L1 Models
		// Diagnostics for linear L1 regression (also known as LAD -
		Least Absolute Deviations), including: estimation, confidence
		intervals, tests of hypotheses, measures of leverage, methods
		of diagnostics for L1 regression, special diagnostics graphs
		and measures of leverage. The algorithms are based in Dielman
		(2005)  doi:10.1080/0094965042000223680, Elian et al. (2000)
		doi:10.1080/03610920008832518 and Dodge (1997)
		doi:10.1006/jmva.1997.1666. This package builds on the
		'quantreg' package, which is a well-established package for
		tuning quantile regression models. There are also tests to
		verify if the errors have a Laplace distribution based on the
		work of Puig and Stephens (2000) doi:10.2307/1270952.
