		A Deep Learning Package for Statistical Classification Analysis
		// Statistical classification has been popular among various
		fields and stayed in the limelight of scientists of those
		fields. Examples of the fields include clinical trials where
		the statistical classification of patients is indispensable to
		predict the clinical courses of diseases. Considering the
		negative impact of diseases on performing daily tasks,
		correctly classifying patients based on the clinical
		information is vital in that we need to identify patients of
		the high-risk group to develop a severe state and arrange
		medical treatment for them at an opportune moment. Deep
		learning - a part of artificial intelligence - has gained much
		attention, and research on it burgeons during past decades. It
		is a veritable technique which was originally designed for the
		classification, and hence, the EzDL package can provide sublime
		solutions to various challenging classification problems
		encountered in the clinical trials. The EzDL package is based
		on the back-propagation algorithm which performs a multi-layer
		feed-forward neural network. This package contains two
		functions: Buddle_Main() and Buddle_Predict(). Buddle_Main()
		builds a feed-forward neural network model and trains the
		model. Buddle_Predict() provokes the trained model which is the
		output of Buddle_Main(), classifies given data, and make a
		final prediction for the data.
