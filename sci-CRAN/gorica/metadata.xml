		Evaluation of Inequality Constrained Hypotheses Using GORICA //
		Implements the generalized order-restricted information
		criterion approximation (GORICA) by Kuiper, Hoijtink,
		Silvapulle (2012) doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2012.03.007. The GORICA is
		an AIC-like information criterion that can be utilized to
		evaluate informative hypotheses specifying directional
		relationships between model parameters in terms of (in)equality
		constraints. The GORICA is applicable not only to normal
		linear models, but also to generalized linear models (GLMs),
		generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), and structural
		equation models (SEMs). In addition, the GORICA can be utilized
		in the context of contingency tables for which (in)equality
		constrained hypotheses do not necessarily contain linear
		restrictions on cell probabilities, but instead often contain
		non-linear restrictions on cell probabilities.
