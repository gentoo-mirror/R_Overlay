		A Grammar of Animated Graphics // The grammar of graphics as
		implemented in the 'ggplot2' package has been successful in
		providing a powerful API for creating static visualisation. In
		order to extend the API for animated graphics this package
		provides a completely new set of grammar, fully compatible with
		'ggplot2' for specifying transitions and animations in a
		flexible and extensible way.
