		Tools to Use and Explore the 'BioTIME' Database // The 'BioTIME'
		database was first published in 2018 and inspired ideas,
		questions, project and research article. To make it even more
		accessible, an R package was created. The 'BioTIMEr' package
		provides tools designed to interact with the 'BioTIME'
		database. The functions provided include the 'BioTIME'
		recommended methods for preparing (gridding and rarefaction)
		time series data, a selection of standard biodiversity metrics
		(including species richness, numerical abundance and
		exponential Shannon) alongside examples on how to display
		change over time. It also includes a sample subset of both the
		query and meta data, the full versions of which are freely
		available on the 'BioTIME' website https://biotime.st-
		andrews.ac.uk/home.php.
