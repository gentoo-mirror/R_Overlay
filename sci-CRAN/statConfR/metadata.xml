		Models of Decision Confidence and Metacognition // Provides
		fitting functions and other tools for decision confidence and
		metacognition researchers, including meta-d'/d', often
		considered to be the gold standard to measure metacognitive
		efficiency. Also allows to fit several static models of
		decision making and confidence to test the assumptions
		underlying meta-d'/d' and which may serve as an alternative
		when the assumptions of meta-d'/d' do not hold. See also Rausch
		et al. (2023) doi:10.1037/met0000634.
