		Calculating Childhood Mortality Rates // Calculates childhood
		(neonatal, postneonatal, infant, child, and under-five)
		mortality rates using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
		microdata. The 'childhoodmortality' package was developed in
		accordance to the methodology outlined in the "DHS Guide to
		Statistics" (Rutstein 2006, http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG
		1/Guide_to_DHS_Statistics_29Oct2012_DHSG1.pdf) Specifically,
		the package uses a synthetic cohort life table approach,
		combining mortality probabilities for age segments with actual
		cohort mortality experience into more common age segments.
		Standard errors for mortality estimates are computed using the
		jackknife repeated replication method outlined in the
		"Estimates of Sampling Errors" appendix of DHS Final Reports
		(DHS 2004,
		http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR175/19AppendixB.pdf). This
		methodology controls for sample design.
