		A Quick Way to Map U.S. Rates and Data of U. S. States, Counties,
		Census Tracts, or Seer Registries using 2000 and 2010 U. S.
		Census Boundaries // Provides an easy way to map seer registry
		area rate data on a U. S, map. The U. S. data may be mapped at
		the state, U. S. NCI Seer Register, state/county or census
		tract level. The function can categorize the data into "n"
		quantiles, where "n" is 3 to 11 or the caller can specify a cut
		point list for the categorizes. The caller can also provide the
		data and the comparison operation to request hatching over any
		areas.  The default operation and value are  0.05 (p-values).
		The location id provided in the data determines the geographic
		level of the mapping. If states, state/counties or census
		tracts are being mapped, the location ids used must be the U.S.
		FIPS codes for states (2 digits), state/counties (5 digits) or
		state/county/census tracts (11 digits). If the location id
		references the U.S. Seer Registry areas, the Seer Registry area
		identifier used to link the data to the geographical areas,
		then the location id is the Seer Registry name or abbreviation.
		Additional parameters are used to provide control over the
		drawing of the boundaries at the data's boundary level and
		higher levels. The package uses modified boundary data from the
		2000 and 2010 U. S. Census to reduce the storage requirements
		and improve drawing speed. The 'SeerMapper' package contains
		the U. S. Census 2000 and 2010 boundary data for the regional,
		state, Seer Registry, and county levels.  Six supplement
		packages contain the census tract boundary data (see manual for
		more details.)
