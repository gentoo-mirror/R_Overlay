		A Quick Way to Map U.S. Rates and Data of U.S. States, Counties,
		Census Tracts, or Seer Registries using 2000 and 2010 U.S.
		Census Boundaries // Provides an easy way to map seer registry
		area rate data on a U.S. map. The U.S. data may be mapped at
		the state or state/county. U.S. Seer registry data may be
		mapped at the Seer registry area, Seer Registry area/county or
		Seer Registry area/county/census tract level. The function uses
		a calculated default categorization breakpoint list for 5
		categories, when not breakpoint list is provided or the number
		of categories is specified by the user. A user provided break
		point list is limited to containing 5 values. The number of
		calculated categories may be from 3 to 11. The user provide the
		p-value for each area and request hatching over any areas with
		a p-value  0.05. Other types of comparisons can be specified.
		If states or state/counties are used, the area identifier is
		the U.S. FIPS codes for states and counties, 2 digits and 5
		digits respectfully.  If the data is for U.S. Seer Registry
		areas, the Seer Registry area identifier used to link the data
		to the geographical area is a Seer Registry area abbreviation.
		See documentation for the list of acceptable Seer Registry area
		names and abbreviations. The state boundaries are overlaid all
		rate maps. The package contains the boundary data for state,
		county, Seer Registry areas, and census tracts for counties
		within a Seer registry area. The package support boundary data
		from the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census. The SeerMapper package
		version contains the U.S. Census 2000 and 2010 boundary data
		for the regional, state, Seer Registry, and county levels.  Six
		supplement packages contain the census tract boundary data.
