		Normalized Stochasticity Ratio // To estimate ecological
		stochasticity in community assembly. Understanding the
		community assembly mechanisms controlling biodiversity patterns
		is a central issue in ecology. Although it is generally
		accepted that both deterministic and stochastic processes play
		important roles in community assembly, quantifying their
		relative importance is challenging. The new index, normalized
		stochasticity ratio (NST), is to estimate ecological
		stochasticity, i.e. relative importance of stochastic
		processes, in community assembly. With functions in this
		package, NST can be calculated based on different similarity
		metrics and/or different null model algorithms, as well as some
		previous indexes, e.g. previous Stochasticity Ratio (ST),
		Standard Effect Size (SES), modified Raup-Crick metrics (RC).
		Functions for permutational test and bootstrapping analysis are
		also included. Previous ST is published by Zhou et al (2014)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.1324044111. NST is modified from ST by
		considering two alternative situations and normalizing the
		index to range from 0 to 1 (Ning et al 2019)
		doi:10.1073/pnas.1904623116. A modified version, MST, is a
		special case of NST, used in some recent or upcoming
		publications, e.g. Liang et al (2020)
		doi:10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.108023. SES is calculated as
		described in Kraft et al (2011) doi:10.1126/science.1208584. RC
		is calculated as reported by Chase et al (2011)
		doi:10.1890/es10-00117.1 and Stegen et al (2013)
		doi:10.1038/ismej.2013.93. Version 3 added NST based on
		phylogenetic beta diversity, used by Ning et al (2020)
		doi:10.1038/s41467-020-18560-z.
