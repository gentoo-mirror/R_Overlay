		Changepoint Additive Models for Time Series Omics Data //
		Provides a comprehensive framework for time series omics
		analysis, integrating changepoint detection, smooth and shape-
		constrained trends, and uncertainty quantification. It supports
		gene- and transcript-level inferences, p-value aggregation for
		improved power, and both case-only and case-control designs. It
		includes an interactive 'shiny' interface. The methods are
		described in Yates et al. (2024) doi:10.1101/2024.12.22.630003.
