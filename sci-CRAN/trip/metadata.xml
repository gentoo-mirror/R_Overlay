		Tools for the Analysis of Animal Track Data // Functions for
		accessing and manipulating spatial data for animal tracking,
		with straightforward coercion from and to other formats. Filter
		for speed and create time spent maps from animal track data.
		There are coercion methods to convert between 'trip' and
		'ltraj' from 'adehabitatLT', and between 'trip' and 'psp' and
		'ppp' from 'spatstat'. Trip objects can be created from raw or
		grouped data frames, and from types in the 'sp', 'sf', 'amt',
		'trackeR', 'mousetrap', and other packages.
