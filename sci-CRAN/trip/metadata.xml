		Tracking Data // Access and manipulate spatial tracking data,
		with straightforward coercion from and to other formats. Filter
		for speed and create time spent maps from tracking data. There
		are coercion methods to convert between 'trip' and 'ltraj' from
		'adehabitatLT', and between 'trip' and 'psp' and 'ppp' from
		'spatstat'. Trip objects can be created from raw or grouped
		data frames, and from types in the 'sp', sf', 'amt', 'trackeR',
		'mousetrap', and other packages, Sumner, MD (2011)
