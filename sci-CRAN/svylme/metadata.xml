		Linear Mixed Models for Complex Survey Data // Linear mixed
		models for complex survey data, by pairwise composite
		likelihood, as described in Lumley  Huang (2023)
		arXiv:2311.13048. Supports nested and crossed random effects,
		and correlated random effects as in genetic models.  Allows for
		multistage sampling and for other designs where pairwise
		sampling probabilities are specified or can be calculated.
