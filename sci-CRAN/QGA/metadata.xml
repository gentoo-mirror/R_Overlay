		Quantum Genetic Algorithm // Function that implements the Quantum
		Genetic Algorithm, first proposed by Han and Kim in 2000. This
		is an R implementation of the 'python' application developed by
		Lahoz-Beltra
		(https://github.com/ResearchCodesHub/QuantumGeneticAlgorithms).
		Each optimization problem is represented as a maximization one,
		where each solution is a sequence of (qu)bits. Following the
		quantum paradigm, these qubits are in a superposition state:
		when measuring them, they collapse in a 0 or 1 state. After
		measurement, the fitness of the solution is calculated as in
		usual genetic algorithms. The evolution at each iteration is
		oriented by the application of two quantum gates to the
		amplitudes of the qubits: (1) a rotation gate (always); (2) a
		Pauli-X gate (optionally). The rotation is based on the theta
		angle values: higher values allow a quicker evolution, and
		lower values avoid local maxima. The Pauli-X gate is equivalent
		to the classical mutation operator and determines the swap
		between alfa and beta amplitudes of a given qubit. The package
		has been developed in such a way as to permit a complete
		separation between the engine, and the particular problem
		subject to combinatorial optimization.
