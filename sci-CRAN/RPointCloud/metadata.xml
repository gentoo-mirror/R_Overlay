		Visualizing Topological Loops and Voids // Visualizations to
		explain the results of a topological data analysis. The goal of
		topological data analysis is to identify persistent topological
		structures, such as loops (topological circles) and voids
		(topological spheres), in data sets. The output of an analysis
		using the 'TDA' package is a Rips diagram (named after the
		mathematician Eliyahu Rips). The goal of 'RPointCloud' is to
		fill in these holes in the data by providing tools to visualize
		the features that help explain the structures found in the Rips
		diagram. See McGee and colleagues (2024)
