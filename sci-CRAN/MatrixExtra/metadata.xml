		Extra Methods for Sparse Matrices // Extends sparse matrix and
		vector classes from the 'Matrix' package by providing: (a)
		Methods and operators that work natively on CSR formats
		(compressed sparse row, a.k.a. 'RsparseMatrix') such as
		slicing/sub-setting, assignment, rbind(), mathematical
		operators for CSR and COO such as addition ("+") or sqrt(), and
		methods such as diag(); (b) Multi-threaded matrix
		multiplication and cross-product for many sparse, dense types,
		including the 'float32' type from 'float'; (c) Coercion methods
		between pairs of classes which are not present in 'Matrix',
		such as 'dgCMatrix' - 'ngRMatrix', as well as convenience
		conversion functions; (d) Utility functions for sparse matrices
		such as sorting the indices or removing zero-valued entries;
		(e) Fast transposes that work by outputting in the opposite
		storage format; (f) Faster replacements for many 'Matrix'
		methods for all sparse types, such as slicing and elementwise
		multiplication.
