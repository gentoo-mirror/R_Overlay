		A Posteriori Probs of Suits Breaking Evenly Across Four Hands //
		We quantitatively evaluated the assertion that says if one suit
		is found to be evenly distributed among the 4 players, the rest
		of the suits are more likely to be evenly distributed. Our
		mathematical analyses show that, if one suit is found to be
		evenly distributed, then a second suit has a slightly elevated
		probability (ranging between 10% to 15%) of being evenly
		distributed. If two suits are found to be evenly distributed,
		then a third suit has a substantially elevated probability
		(ranging between 30% to 50%) of being evenly distributed.This
		package refers to methods and authentic data from Ely
