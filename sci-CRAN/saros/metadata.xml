		Semi-Automatic Reporting of Ordinary Surveys // Offers a
		systematic way for conditional reporting of figures and tables
		for many (and bivariate combinations of) variables, typically
		from survey data. Contains interactive 'ggiraph'-based
		(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggiraph) plotting functions
		and data frame-based summary tables (bivariate significance
		tests, frequencies/proportions, unique open ended responses,
		etc) with many arguments for customization, and extensions
		possible. Uses a global options() system for neatly reducing
		redundant code. Also contains tools for immediate saving of
		objects and returning a hashed link to the object, useful for
		creating download links to high resolution images upon
		rendering in 'Quarto'. Suitable for highly customized reports,
		primarily intended for survey research.
