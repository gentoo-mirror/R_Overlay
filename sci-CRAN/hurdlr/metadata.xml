		Zero-Inflated and Hurdle Modelling Using Bayesian Inference //
		When considering count data, it is often the case that many
		more zero counts than would be expected of some given
		distribution are observed. It is well established that data
		such as this can be reliably modelled using zero-inflated or
		hurdle distributions, both of which may be applied using the
		functions in this package. Bayesian analysis methods are used
		to best model problematic count data that cannot be fit to any
		typical distribution. The package functions are flexible and
		versatile, and can be applied to varying count distributions,
		parameter estimation with or without explanatory variable
		information, and are able to allow for multiple hurdles as it
		is also not uncommon that count data have an abundance of
		large-number observations which would be considered outliers of
		the typical distribution. In lieu of throwing out data or
		misspecifying the typical distribution, these extreme
		observations can be applied to a second, extreme distribution.
		With the given functions of this package, such a two-hurdle
		model may be easily specified in order to best manage data that
		is both zero-inflated and over-dispersed.
