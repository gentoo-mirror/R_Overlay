		Assessment of Risk Prediction Models // We included functions to
		assess the performance of risk models. The package contains
		functions for the various measures that are used in empirical
		studies, including univariate and multivariate odds ratios (OR)
		of the predictors, the c-statistic (or area under the receiver
		operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)), Hosmer-Lemeshow
		goodness of fit test, reclassification table, net
		reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated
		discrimination improvement (IDI). Also included are functions
		to create plots, such as risk distributions, ROC curves,
		calibration plot, discrimination box plot and predictiveness
		curves. In addition to functions to assess the performance of
		risk models, the package includes functions to obtain weighted
		and unweighted risk scores as well as predicted risks using
		logistic regression analysis. These logistic regression
		functions are specifically written for models that include
		genetic variables, but they can also be applied to models that
		are based on non-genetic risk factors only. Finally, the
		package includes function to construct a simulated dataset with
		genotypes, genetic risks, and disease status for a hypothetical
		population, which is used for the evaluation of genetic risk
		models.
