		Integrative Visualizations of the Lipidome // Create lipidome-
		wide heatmaps of statistics with the 'lipidomeR'. The
		'lipidomeR' provides a streamlined pipeline for the systematic
		interpretation of the lipidome through publication-ready
		visualizations of regression models fitted on lipidomics data.
		With 'lipidomeR', associations between covariates and the
		lipidome can be interpreted systematically and intuitively
		through heatmaps, where lipids are categorized by the lipid
		class and are presented on two-dimensional maps organized by
		the lipid size and level of saturation. This way, the
		'lipidomeR' helps you gain an immediate understanding of the
		multivariate patterns in the lipidome already at first glance.
		You can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistical
		associations, changes, differences, variation, or other lipid-
		specific values. The heatmaps are provided with publication-
		ready quality and the results behind the visualizations are
		based on rigorous statistical models.
