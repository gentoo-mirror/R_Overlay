		Rcpp Integration for CGAL // Creates a header only package to
		link to the CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
		header files in Rcpp. There are a variety of potential uses for
		the software such as Hilbert sorting, KDtree nearest neighbors,
		and convex hull algorithms. There is only one R function in
		this package, which returns the current version of the CGAL
		library included. For more information about how to use the
		header files, see the CGAL documentation at
		https://www.cgal.org. Currently includes the CGAL 5.3.1 stable
		release.
