		'Rcpp' Integration for 'CGAL' // Creates a header only package to
		link to the 'CGAL' (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
		header files in 'Rcpp'. There are a variety of potential uses
		for the software such as Hilbert sorting, K-D Tree nearest
		neighbors, and convex hull algorithms. For more information
		about how to use the header files, see the 'CGAL' documentation
		at https://www.cgal.org. Currently downloads version 6.0.1 of
		the 'CGAL' header files.
