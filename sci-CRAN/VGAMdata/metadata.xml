		Data Supporting the 'VGAM' Package // Mainly data sets to
		accompany the VGAM package and the book "Vector Generalized
		Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee,
		2015) DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7. These are used to
		illustrate vector generalized linear and additive models
		(VGLMs/VGAMs), and associated models (Reduced-Rank VGLMs,
		Quadratic RR-VGLMs, Row-Column Interaction Models, and
		constrained and unconstrained ordination models in ecology).
		This package now contains some old VGAM family functions which
		have been replaced by newer ones (often because they are now
		special cases).
