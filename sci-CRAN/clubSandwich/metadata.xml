		Cluster-Robust (Sandwich) Variance Estimators with Small-Sample
		Corrections // Provides several cluster-robust variance
		estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) for ordinary and
		weighted least squares linear regression models, including the
		bias-reduced linearization estimator introduced by Bell and
		McCaffrey (2002) http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/12-001-x/2002002/
		article/9058-eng.pdf and developed further by Pustejovsky and
		Tipton (2017) DOI:10.1080/07350015.2016.1247004. The package
		includes functions for estimating the variance- covariance
		matrix and for testing single- and multiple- contrast
		hypotheses based on Wald test statistics. Tests of single
		regression coefficients use Satterthwaite or saddle-point
		corrections. Tests of multiple- contrast hypotheses use an
		approximation to Hotelling's T-squared distribution. Methods
		are provided for a variety of fitted models, including lm() and
		mlm objects, glm(), ivreg() (from package 'AER'), plm() (from
		package 'plm'), gls() and lme() (from 'nlme'), robu() (from
		'robumeta'), and rma.uni() and rma.mv() (from 'metafor').
