		Cluster-Robust (Sandwich) Variance Estimators with Small-Sample
		Corrections // Provides several cluster-robust variance
		estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) for ordinary and
		weighted least squares linear regression models, including the
		bias-reduced linearization estimator introduced by Bell and
		McCaffrey (2002) https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-
		x/2002002/article/9058-eng.pdf and developed further by
		Pustejovsky and Tipton (2017)
		DOI:10.1080/07350015.2016.1247004. The package includes
		functions for estimating the variance- covariance matrix and
		for testing single- and multiple- contrast hypotheses based on
		Wald test statistics. Tests of single regression coefficients
		use Satterthwaite or saddle-point corrections. Tests of
		multiple- contrast hypotheses use an approximation to
		Hotelling's T-squared distribution. Methods are provided for a
		variety of fitted models, including lm() and mlm objects,
		glm(), geeglm() (from package 'geepack'), ivreg() (from package
		'AER'), ivreg() (from package 'ivreg' when estimated by
		ordinary least squares), plm() (from package 'plm'), gls() and
		lme() (from 'nlme'), lmer() (from `lme4`), robu() (from
		'robumeta'), and rma.uni() and rma.mv() (from 'metafor').
