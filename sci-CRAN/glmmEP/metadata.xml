		Generalized Linear Mixed Model Analysis via Expectation
		Propagation // Approximate frequentist inference for
		generalized linear mixed model analysis with expectation
		propagation used to circumvent the need for multivariate
		integration. In this version, the random effects can be any
		reasonable dimension. However, only probit mixed models with
		one level of nesting are supported. The methodology is
		described in Hall, Johnstone, Ormerod, Wand and Yu (2018)
		arXiv:1805.08423v1.
