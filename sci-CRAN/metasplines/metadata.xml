		Pool Literature-Based and Individual Participant Data Based
		Spline Estimates // Pooling estimates reported in meta-analyses
		(literature-based, LB) and estimates based on individual
		participant data (IPD) is not straight-forward as the details
		of the LB nonlinear function estimate are not usually reported.
		This package pools the nonlinear IPD dose-response estimates
		based on a natural cubic spline from lm or glm with the
		pointwise LB estimates and their estimated variances. Details
		will be presented in Hrknen, Tapanainen, Sares-Jske, Mnnist,
		Kaartinen and Paalanen (2025) "Novel pooling method for
		nonlinear cohort analysis and meta-analysis estimates:
		Predicting health outcomes based on climate-friendly diets"
