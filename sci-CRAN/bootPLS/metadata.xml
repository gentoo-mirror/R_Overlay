		Bootstrap Hyperparameter Selection for PLS Models and Extensions
		// Several implementations of non-parametric stable bootstrap-
		based techniques to determine the numbers of components for
		Partial Least Squares linear or generalized linear regression
		models as well as and sparse Partial Least Squares linear or
		generalized linear regression models. The package collects
		techniques that were published in a book chapter (Magnanensi et
		al. 2016, 'The Multiple Facets of Partial Least Squares and
		Related Methods', doi:10.1007/978-3-319-40643-5_18) and two
		articles (Magnanensi et al. 2017, 'Statistics and Computing',
		doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9651-4) and (Magnanensi et al. 2021,
		'Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics',
		doi:10.3389/fams.2021.693126).
