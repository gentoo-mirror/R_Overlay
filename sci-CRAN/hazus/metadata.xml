		Damage functions from FEMA's HAZUS software for use in modeling
		financial losses from natural disasters // Damage Functions
		(DFs), also known as Vulnerability Functions, associate the
		physical damage to a building or a structure (and also its
		contents and inventory) from natural disasters to financial
		damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in USA
		developed several thousand DFs and these serve as a benchmark
		in natural catastrophe modeling, both in academia and industry.
		However, these DFs and their documentation are buried within
		the HAZUS software are not easily accessible for analysis and
		visualization. This package provides more than 1300 raw DFs
		used by FEMA's HAZUS software and also functionality to extract
		and visualize DFs specific to the flood hazard. The vignette
		included with this package demonstrates its use.
