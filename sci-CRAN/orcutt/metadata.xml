		Estimate Procedure in Case of First Order Autocorrelation //
		Solve first order autocorrelation problems using an iterative
		method. This procedure estimates both autocorrelation and beta
		coefficients recursively until we reach the convergence (8th
		decimal as default). The residuals are computed after
		estimating Beta using EGLS approach and Rho is estimated using
		the previous residuals.
