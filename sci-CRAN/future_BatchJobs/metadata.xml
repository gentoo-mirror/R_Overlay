		A Future API for Parallel and Distributed Processing using
		BatchJobs // Implementation of the Future API on top of the
		'BatchJobs' package. This allows you to process futures, as
		defined by the 'future' package, in parallel out of the box,
		not only on your local machine or ad-hoc cluster of machines,
		but also via high-performance compute ('HPC') job schedulers
		such as 'LSF', 'OpenLava', 'Slurm', 'SGE', and 'TORQUE' /
		'PBS', e.g. 'y - future.apply::future_lapply(files, FUN =
		process)'. NOTE: The 'BatchJobs' package is deprecated in favor
		of the 'batchtools' package. Because of this, it is recommended
		to use the 'future.batchtools' package instead of this package.
