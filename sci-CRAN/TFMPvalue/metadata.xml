		Efficient and Accurate P-Value Computation for Position Weight
		Matrices // In putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites
		(TFBSs) identification from sequence/alignments, we are
		interested in the significance of certain match score.
		TFMPvalue provides the accurate calculation of P-value with
		score threshold for Position Weight Matrices, or the score with
		given P-value. This package is an interface to code originally
		made available by Helene Touzet and Jean-Stephane Varre, 2007,
		Algorithms Mol Biol:2, 15.
