		Chi-Square and G-Square Test of Independence, Power and Residual
		Analysis, Measures of Categorical Association // Provides the
		facility to perform the chi-square and G-square test of
		independence, calculates the retrospective power of the
		traditional chi-square test, compute permutation and Monte
		Carlo p-value, and provides measures of association for tables
		of any size such as Phi, Phi corrected, odds ratio with 95
		percent CI and p-value, Yule' Q and Y, adjusted contingency
		coefficient, Cramer's V, V corrected, V standardised, bias-
		corrected V, W, Cohen's w, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, and tau.
		It also calculates standardised, moment-corrected standardised,
		and adjusted standardised residuals, and their significance, as
		well as the Quetelet Index, IJ association factor, and adjusted
		standardised counts. It also computes the chi-square-maximising
		version of the input table. Different outputs are returned in
		nicely formatted tables.
