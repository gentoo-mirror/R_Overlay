		Chi-Square and G-Square Test of Independence, Residual Analysis,
		and Measures of Categorical Association // Provides the
		facility to perform the chi-square and G-square test of
		independence, calculates permutation-based p value, and
		provides measures of association such as Phi, odds ratio with
		95 percent CI and p value, adjusted contingency coefficient,
		Cramer's V and 95 percent CI, bias-corrected Cramer's V,
		Cohen's w, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, gamma and its p value, and
		tau, Cohen's k and its 95 percent CI. It also calculates
		standardized, moment-corrected standardized, and adjusted
		standardized residuals, and their significance. Different
		outputs are returned in nicely formatted tables.
