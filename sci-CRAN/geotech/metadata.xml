		Geotechnical Engineering // A compilation of functions for
		performing calculations and creating plots that commonly arise
		in geotechnical engineering and soil mechanics. The types of
		calculations that are currently included are: (1) phase
		diagrams and index parameters, (2) grain-size distributions,
		(3) plasticity, (4) soil classification, (5) compaction, (6)
		groundwater, (7) subsurface stresses (geostatic and induced),
		(8) Mohr circle analyses, (9) consolidation settlement and
		rate, (10) shear strength, (11) bearing capacity, (12) lateral
		earth pressures, (13) slope stability, and (14) subsurface
		explorations. Geotechnical engineering students, educators,
		researchers, and practitioners will find this package useful.
