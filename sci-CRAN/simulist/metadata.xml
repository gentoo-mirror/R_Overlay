		Simulate Disease Outbreak Line List and Contacts Data // Tools to
		simulate realistic raw case data for an epidemic in the form of
		line lists and contacts using a branching process. Simulated
		outbreaks are parameterised with epidemiological parameters and
		can have age structured populations, age-stratified
		hospitalisation and death risk and time-varying case fatality
		risk.
