		Lightweight Repackaging of 'Themes' for 'ggplot2' // Themes for
		'ggplot2' are a convenient way to style plots. The 'hrbrthemes'
		package contains a particularly nice one, but brings along a
		significant tail of dependencies. So this (currently
		experimental) package brings along just the 'theme_ipsum_rc'
		theme using the 'Roboto' 'Condensed' font.  Should the font not
		be installed on your system, see the help in the package
		'hrbrthemes' on how to install 'Roboto Condensed'. Note that
		'hrbrthemes' is now archived at CRAN.
