		Feature Extraction from Biological Sequences // Extracts features
		from biological sequences. It contains most features which are
		presented in related work and also includes features which have
		never been introduced before. It extracts numerous features
		from nucleotide and peptide sequences. Each feature converts
		the input sequences to discrete numbers in order to use them as
		predictors in machine learning models. There are many features
		and information which are hidden inside a sequence. Utilizing
		the package, users can convert biological sequences to discrete
		models based on chosen properties. References: 'iLearn' 'Z.
