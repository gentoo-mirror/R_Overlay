		Fit Univariate Distributions // Wrapper for computing parameters
		for univariate distributions using MLE. It creates an object
		that stores d, p, q, r functions as well as parameters and
		statistics for diagnostics. Currently supports automated
		fitting from base and actuar packages. A manually fitting
		distribution fitting function is included to support directly
		specifying parameters for any distribution from ancillary
		packages.
