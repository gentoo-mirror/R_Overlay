		Lookup Tables to Generate Poverty Likelihoods and Rates using the
		Poverty Probability Index (PPI) // The Poverty Probability
		Index (PPI) is a poverty measurement tool for organizations and
		businesses with a mission to serve the poor. The PPI is
		statistically-sound, yet simple to use: the answers to 10
		questions about a household's characteristics and asset
		ownership are scored to compute the likelihood that the
		household is living below the poverty line - or above by only a
		narrow margin. This package contains country-specific lookup
		data tables used as reference to determine the poverty
		likelihood of a household based on their score from the
		country-specific PPI questionnaire. These lookup tables have
		been extracted from documentation of the PPI found at
		https://www.povertyindex.org and managed by Innovations for
		Poverty Action https://poverty-action.org/.
