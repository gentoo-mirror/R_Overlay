		Likelihood-Based Inference for Time Series Extremes // Performs
		likelihood-based inference for stationary time series extremes.
		The general approach follows Fawcett and Walshaw (2012)
		doi:10.1002/env.2133.  Marginal extreme value inferences are
		adjusted for cluster dependence in the data using the
		methodology in Chandler and Bate (2007)
		doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015, producing an adjusted log-likelihood
		for the model parameters.  A log-likelihood for the extremal
		index is produced using the K-gaps model of Suveges and Davison
		(2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292. These log-likelihoods are
		combined to make inferences about extreme values. Both maximum
		likelihood and Bayesian approaches are available.
