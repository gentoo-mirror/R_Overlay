		Model Selection and Post-Hoc Analysis for (G)LMER Models // The
		main function of the package is to perform backward selection
		of fixed effects, forward fitting of the random effects, and
		post-hoc analysis using parallel capabilities. Other
		functionality includes the computation of ANOVAs with upper- or
		lower-bound p-values and R-squared values for each model term,
		model criticism plots, data trimming on model residuals, and
		data visualization. The data to run examples is contained in
		package LCF_data.
