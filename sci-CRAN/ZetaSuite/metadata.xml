		Analyze High-Dimensional High-Throughput Dataset and Quality
		Control Single-Cell RNA-Seq // The advent of genomic
		technologies has enabled the generation of two-dimensional or
		even multi-dimensional high-throughput data, e.g., monitoring
		multiple changes in gene expression in genome-wide siRNA
		screens across many different cell types (E Robert McDonald 3rd
		(2017) doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.005 and Tsherniak A (2017)
		doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.010) or single cell transcriptomics
		under different experimental conditions. We found that simple
		computational methods based on a single statistical criterion
		is no longer adequate for analyzing such multi-dimensional
		data. We herein introduce 'ZetaSuite', a statistical package
		initially designed to score hits from two-dimensional RNAi
		screens.We also illustrate a unique utility of 'ZetaSuite' in
		analyzing single cell transcriptomics to differentiate rare
		cells from damaged ones (Vento-Tormo R (2018) doi:
		10.1038/s41586-018-0698-6). In 'ZetaSuite', we  have the
		following steps: QC of input datasets, normalization using
		Z-transformation, Zeta score calculation and hits selection
		based on defined Screen Strength.
