		Reproducible Pipeline Infrastructure for Neuroscience // Defines
		the underlying pipeline structure for reproducible
		neuroscience, adopted by 'RAVE' (reproducible analysis and
		visualization of intracranial electroencephalography); provides
		high-level class definition to build, compile, set, execute,
		and share analysis pipelines. Both R and 'Python' are
		supported, with 'Markdown' and 'shiny' dashboard templates for
		extending and building customized pipelines. See the full
		documentations at https://rave.wiki; to cite us, check out our
		paper by Magnotti, Wang, and Beauchamp (2020,
		doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117341), or run
		citation("ravepipeline") for details.
