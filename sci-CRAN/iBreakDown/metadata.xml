		Model Agnostic Instance Level Variable Attributions // Model
		agnostic tool for decomposition of predictions from black
		boxes. Supports additive attributions and attributions with
		interactions. The Break Down Table shows contributions of every
		variable to a final prediction. The Break Down Plot presents
		variable contributions in a concise graphical way. This package
		works for classification and regression models. It is an
		extension of the 'breakDown' package (Staniak and Biecek 2018)
		doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-072, with new and faster strategies for
		orderings. It supports interactions in explanations and has
		interactive visuals (implemented with 'D3.js' library). The
		methodology behind is described in the 'iBreakDown' article
		(Gosiewska and Biecek 2019) arXiv:1903.11420 This package is a
		part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe (Biecek 2018) arXiv:1806.08915.
