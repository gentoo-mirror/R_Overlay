		Small Count Rounding of Tabular Data // A statistical disclosure
		control tool to protect frequency tables in cases where small
		values are sensitive. The function PLSrounding() performs small
		count rounding of necessary inner cells so that all small
		frequencies of cross-classifications to be published
		(publishable cells) are rounded. This is equivalent to changing
		micro data since frequencies of unique combinations are
		changed. Thus, additivity and consistency are guaranteed. The
		methodology is described in Langsrud and Heldal (2018) https://
		www.researchgate.net/publication/327768398_An_Algorithm_for_Sma
		ll_Count_Rounding_of_Tabular_Data.
