		Thermodynamic Calculations for Geobiochemistry // An integrated
		set of tools for thermodynamic calculations in geochemistry and
		compositional biology. Thermodynamic properties are taken from
		a database for minerals and inorganic and organic aqueous
		species including biomolecules, or from amino acid group
		additivity for proteins. High-temperature properties are
		calculated using the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations
		of state for aqueous species, and activity coefficients can be
		calculated for specified ionic strength. Functions are provided
		to define a system using basis species, automatically balance
		reactions, calculate the chemical affinities of formation
		reactions for selected species, calculate equilibrium
		activities, and plot the results on chemical activity diagrams.
