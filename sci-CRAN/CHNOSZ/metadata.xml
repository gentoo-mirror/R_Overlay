		Thermodynamic Calculations and Diagrams for Geochemistry // An
		integrated set of tools for thermodynamic calculations in
		aqueous geochemistry and geobiochemistry. Functions are
		provided for writing balanced reactions to form species from
		user-selected basis species and for calculating the standard
		molal properties of species and reactions, including the
		standard Gibbs energy and equilibrium constant. Calculations of
		the non-equilibrium chemical affinity and equilibrium chemical
		activity of species can be portrayed on diagrams as a function
		of temperature, pressure, or activity of basis species; in two
		dimensions, this gives a maximum affinity or predominance
		diagram. The diagrams have formatted chemical formulas and axis
		labels, and water stability limits can be added to Eh-pH,
		oxygen fugacity- temperature, and other diagrams with a redox
		variable. The package has been developed to handle common
		calculations in aqueous geochemistry, such as solubility due to
		complexation of metal ions, mineral buffers of redox or pH, and
		changing the basis species across a diagram ("mosaic
		diagrams"). CHNOSZ also implements a group additivity algorithm
		for the standard thermodynamic properties of proteins.
