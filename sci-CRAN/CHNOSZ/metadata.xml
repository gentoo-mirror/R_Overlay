		Chemical Thermodynamics and Activity Diagrams // An integrated
		set of tools for thermodynamic calculations in compositional
		biology and geochemistry. Thermodynamic properties are taken
		from a database for minerals and inorganic and organic aqueous
		species including biomolecules, or from amino acid group
		additivity for proteins. High-temperature properties are
		calculated using the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations
		of state for aqueous species. Functions are provided to define
		a system using basis species, automatically balance reactions,
		calculate the chemical affinities of reactions for selected
		species, and plot the results on potential diagrams or
		equilibrium activity diagrams. Experimental features are
		available to calculate activity coefficients for aqueous
		species or for multidimensional optimization of thermodynamic
		variables using an objective function.
