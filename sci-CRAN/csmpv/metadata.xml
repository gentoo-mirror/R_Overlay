		Biomarker Confirmation, Selection, Modelling, Prediction, and
		Validation // There are diverse purposes such as biomarker
		confirmation, novel biomarker discovery, constructing
		predictive models, model-based prediction, and validation. It
		handles binary, continuous, and time-to-event outcomes at the
		sample or patient level. - Biomarker confirmation utilizes
		established functions like glm() from 'stats', coxph() from
		'survival', surv_fit(), and ggsurvplot() from 'survminer'. -
		Biomarker discovery and variable selection are facilitated by
		three LASSO-related functions LASSO2(), LASSO_plus(), and
		LASSO2plus(), leveraging the 'glmnet' R package with additional
		steps. - Eight versatile modeling functions are offered, each
		designed for predictive models across various outcomes and data
		types. 1) LASSO2(), LASSO_plus(), LASSO2plus(), and
		LASSO2_reg() perform variable selection using LASSO methods and
		construct predictive models based on selected variables. 2)
		XGBtraining() employs 'XGBoost' for model building and is the
		only function not involving variable selection. 3) Functions
		like LASSO2_XGBtraining(), LASSOplus_XGBtraining(), and
		LASSO2plus_XGBtraining() combine LASSO-related variable
		selection with 'XGBoost' for model construction. - All models
		support prediction and validation, requiring a testing dataset
		comparable to the training dataset. Additionally, the package
		introduces XGpred() for risk prediction based on survival data,
		with the XGpred_predict() function available for predicting
		risk groups in new datasets. The methodology is based on our
		new algorithms and various references: - Hastie et al. (1992,
