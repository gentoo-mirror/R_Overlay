		Estimating the Degrees of Freedom of the Student's t-Distribution
		under a Bayesian Framework // A Bayesian framework to estimate
		the Student's t-distribution's degrees of freedom is developed.
		Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling routines are developed as in
		doi:10.3390/axioms11090462 to sample from the posterior
		distribution of the degrees of freedom. A random walk
		Metropolis algorithm is used for sampling when Jeffrey's and
		Gamma priors are endowed upon the degrees of freedom. In
		addition, the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm for
		sampling is used under the Jeffrey's prior specification. The
		Log-normal prior over the degrees of freedom is posed as a
		viable choice with comparable performance in simulations and
		real-data application, against other prior choices, where an
		Elliptical Slice Sampler is used to sample from the concerned
		posterior.
