		Analysis of Oceanographic Argo Floats // Supports the analysis of
		oceanographic data recorded by Argo autonomous drifting
		profiling floats. Functions are provided to (a) download and
		cache data files, (b) subset data in various ways, (c) handle
		quality-control flags and (d) plot the results according to
		oceanographic conventions. A shiny app is provided for easy
		exploration of datasets. The package is designed to work well
		with the 'oce' package, providing a wide range of processing
		capabilities that are particular to oceanographic analysis. See
		Kelley, Harbin, and Richards (2021)
		doi:10.3389/fmars.2021.635922 for more on the scientific
		context and applications.
