		High-Dimensional Matrix Factor Analysis // Hign-dimensional
		matrix factor models have drawn much attention in view of the
		fact that observations are usually well structured to be an
		array such as in macroeconomics and finance. In addition, data
		often exhibit heavy-tails and thus it is also important to
		develop robust procedures. We aim to address this issue by
		replacing the least square loss with Huber loss function. We
		propose two algorithms to do robust factor analysis by
		considering the Huber loss. One is based on minimizing the
		Huber loss of the idiosyncratic error's Frobenius norm, which
		leads to a weighted iterative projection approach to compute
		and learn the parameters and thereby named as Robust-Matrix-
		Factor-Analysis (RMFA), see the details in He et al.
		(2023)doi:10.1080/07350015.2023.2191676. The other one is based
		on minimizing the element-wise Huber loss, which can be solved
		by an iterative Huber regression algorithm (IHR). In this
		package, we also provide the algorithm for alpha-PCA by Chen
		Fan (2021) doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1970569, the Projected
		estimation (PE) method by Yu et al.
		(2022)doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.04.001. In addition, the
		methods for determining the pair of factor numbers are also
		given.
