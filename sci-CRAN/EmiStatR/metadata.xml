		Estimation of Wastewater Emissions in Combined Sewer Systems //
		The EmiStatR provides a fast and parallelised calculator to
		estimate combined wastewater emissions. It supports the
		planning and design of urban drainage systems, without the
		requirement of extensive simulation tools. The EmiStatR package
		implements modular R methods. This enables to add new
		functionalities through the R framework. Furthermore, EmiStatR
		was implemented with an interactive user interface with sliders
		and input data exploration.
