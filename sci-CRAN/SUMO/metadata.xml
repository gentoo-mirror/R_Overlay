		Generating Multi-Omics Datasets for Testing and Benchmarking //
		Provides tools to simulate multi-omics datasets with predefined
		signal structures. The generated data can be used for testing,
		validating, and benchmarking integrative analysis methods such
		as factor models and clustering approaches. This version
		includes enhanced signal customization, visualization tools
		(scatter, histogram, 3D), MOFA-based analysis pipelines,
		PowerPoint export, and statistical profiling of datasets.
		Designed for both method development and teaching, SUMO
		supports real and synthetic data pipelines with interpretable
		outputs. Tini, Giulia, et al (2019) doi:10.1093/bib/bbx167.
