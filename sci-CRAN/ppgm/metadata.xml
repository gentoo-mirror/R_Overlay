		PaleoPhyloGeographic Modeling of Climate Niches and Species
		Distributions // Reconstruction of paleoclimate niches using
		phylogenetic comparative methods and projection reconstructed
		niches onto paleoclimate maps. The user can specify various
		models of trait evolution or estimate the best fit model,
		include fossils, use one or multiple phylogenies for inference,
		and make animations of shifting suitable habitat through time.
		This model was first used in Lawing and Polly (2011), and
		further implemented in Lawing et al (2016) and Rivera et al
		(2020). Lawing and Polly (2011)

		to better understand species' response to climate change"
