		Network of Differential Equations // Simulates a network of
		ordinary differential equations of order two. The package
		provides an easy interface to construct networks. In addition
		you are able to define different external triggers to
		manipulate the trajectory. The method is described by Surmann,
		Ligges, and Wheis (2014) doi:10.1109/ENERGYCON.2014.6850482.
