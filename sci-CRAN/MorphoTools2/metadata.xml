		Multivariate Morphometric Analysis // Tools for multivariate
		analyses of morphological data, wrapped in one package, to make
		the workflow convenient and fast. Statistical and graphical
		tools provide a comprehensive framework for checking and
		manipulating input data, statistical analyses, and
		visualization of results. Several methods are provided for the
		analysis of raw data, to make the dataset ready for downstream
		analyses. Integrated statistical methods include hierarchical
		classification, principal component analysis, principal
		coordinates analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and
		multiple discriminant analyses: canonical, stepwise, and
		classificatory (linear, quadratic, and the non-parametric k
		nearest neighbours). The philosophy of the package is described
		in lenker et al. 2022.
