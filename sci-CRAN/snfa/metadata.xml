		Smooth Non-Parametric Frontier Analysis // Fitting of non-
		parametric production frontiers for use in efficiency analysis.
		Methods are provided for both a smooth analogue of Data
		Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a non-parametric analogue of
		Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Frontiers are constructed
		for multiple inputs and a single output using constrained
		kernel smoothing as in Racine et al. (2009), which allow for
		the imposition of monotonicity and concavity constraints on the
		estimated frontier.
