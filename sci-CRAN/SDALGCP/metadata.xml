		Spatially Discrete Approximation to Log-Gaussian Cox Processes
		for Aggregated Disease Count Data // Provides a computationally
		efficient discrete approximation to log-Gaussian Cox process
		model for spatially aggregated disease count data. It uses
		Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood for model parameter estimation
		as proposed by Christensen (2004) doi: 10.1198/106186004X2525
		and delivers prediction of spatially discrete and continuous
		relative risk.
