		Mass Measurement Corrections // Mass measurement corrections and
		uncertainties using calibration data, as recommended by
		EURAMET's guideline No. 18 (2015) ISBN:978-3-942992-40-4 . The
		package provides classes, functions, and methods for storing
		information contained in calibration certificates and
		converting balance readings to both conventional mass and real
		mass. For the latter, the Magnitude of the Air Buoyancy
		Correction factor employs models (such as the CIMP-2007 formula
		revised by Picard, Davis, Glser, and Fujii (2008)
		doi:10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/004) to estimate the local air
		density using measured environmental conditions.
