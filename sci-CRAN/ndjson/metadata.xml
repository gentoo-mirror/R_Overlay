		Wicked-Fast Streaming 'JSON' ('ndjson') Reader // Streaming
		'JSON' ('ndjson') has one 'JSON' record per-line and many
		modern 'ndjson' files contain large numbers of records. These
		constructs may not be columnar in nature, but it's often useful
		to read in these files and "flatten" the structure out to work
		in an R data.frame-like context. Functions are provided that
		make it possible to read in plain 'ndjson' files or compressed
		('gz') 'ndjson' files and either validate the format of the
		records or create "flat" data.table ('tbl_dt') structures from
		them.
