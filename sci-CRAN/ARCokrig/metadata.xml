		Autoregressive Cokriging Models for Multifidelity Codes // For
		emulating multifidelity computer models. The major methods
		include univariate autoregressive cokriging and multivariate
		autoregressive cokriging. The autoregressive cokriging methods
		are implemented for both hierarchically nested design and non-
		nested design. For hierarchically nested design, the model
		parameters are estimated via standard optimization algorithms;
		For non-nested design, the model parameters are estimated via
		Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithms. In both
		cases, the priors are chosen such that the posterior
		distributions are proper. Notice that the uniform priors on
		range parameters in the correlation function lead to improper
		posteriors. This should be avoided when Bayesian analysis is
		adopted. The development of objective priors for autoregressive
		cokriging models can be found in Pulong Ma (2019)
		arXiv:1910.10225. The development of the multivariate
		autoregressive cokriging models with possibly non-nested design
		can be found in Pulong Ma, Georgios Karagiannis, Bledar A
		Konomi, Taylor G Asher, Gabriel R Toro, and Andrew T Cox (2019)
		arXiv:1909.01836.
