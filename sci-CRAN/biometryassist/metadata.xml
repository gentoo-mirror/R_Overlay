		Functions to Assist Design and Analysis of Agronomic Experiments
		// Provides functions to aid in the design and analysis of
		agronomic and agricultural experiments through easy access to
		documentation and helper functions, especially for users who
		are learning these concepts. While not required for most
		functionality, this package enhances the `asreml` package which
		provides a computationally efficient algorithm for fitting
		mixed models using Residual Maximum Likelihood. It is a
		commercial package that can be purchased as 'asreml-R' from
		'VSNi' https://vsni.co.uk/, who will supply a zip file for
		local installation/updating (see
		https://asreml.kb.vsni.co.uk/).
