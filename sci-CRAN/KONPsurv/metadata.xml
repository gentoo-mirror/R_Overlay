		KONP Tests: Powerful K-Sample Tests for Right-Censored Data //
		The K-sample omnibus non-proportional hazards (KONP) tests are
		powerful non-parametric tests for comparing K (=2) hazard
		functions based on right-censored data (Gorfine, Schlesinger
		and Hsu, 2020, doi:10.1177/0962280220907355). These tests are
		consistent against any differences between the hazard functions
		of the groups. The KONP tests are often more powerful than
		other existing tests, especially under non-proportional hazard
		functions.
