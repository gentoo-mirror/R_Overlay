		Ridge Estimation of Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) Processes // The
		ragt2ridges-package provides ridge maximum likelihood
		estimation of vector auto-regressive processes: the VAR(1),
		VAR(2) and VARX(1) model (more to be added). Prior knowledge
		may be incorporated in the estimation through a) specification
		of the edges believed to be absent in the time series chain
		graph, and b) a shrinkage target towards which the parameter
		estimate is shrunken for large penalty parameter values.
		Estimation functionality is accompanied by methodology for
		penalty parameter selection. In addition, the package offers
		supporting functionality for the exploitation of estimated
		models. Among others, i) a procedure to infer the support of
		the non-sparse ridge estimate (and thereby of the time series
		chain graph) is implemented, ii) a table of node-wise network
		summary statistics, iii) mutual information analysis, and iv)
		impulse response analysis. Cf. Miok et al. (2017)
		DOI:10.1002/bimj.201500269 and Miok et al. (2019)
		DOI:10.1002/bimj.201700195 for details on the implemented
		methods.
