		Landscape Epidemiology and Evolution // A spatio-temporal
		stochastic model to assess resistance deployment strategies
		against plant pathogens. The model is based on stochastic
		geometry for describing the landscape and the resistant hosts,
		a dispersal kernel for the dissemination of the pathogen, and a
		SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) architecture to
		simulate plant response to disease. Loup Rimbaud, Julien Papax,
