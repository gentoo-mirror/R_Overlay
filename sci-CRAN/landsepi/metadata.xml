		Landscape Epidemiology and Evolution // A stochastic, spatially-
		explicit, demo-genetic model simulating the spread and
		evolution of a plant pathogen in a heterogeneous landscape to
		assess resistance deployment strategies. It is based on a
		spatial geometry for describing the landscape and allocation of
		different cultivars, a dispersal kernel for the dissemination
		of the pathogen, and a SEIR ('Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-
		Removed) structure with a discrete time step. It provides a
		useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of
		deployment options with respect to their epidemiological,
		evolutionary and economic outcomes. Loup Rimbaud, Julien Papax,
