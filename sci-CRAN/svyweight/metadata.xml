		Quick and Flexible Survey Weighting // Quickly and flexibly
		calculates weights for survey data, in order to correct for
		survey non-response or other sampling issues. Uses rake
		weighting, a common technique also know as rim weighting or
		iterative proportional fitting.  This technique allows for
		weighting on multiple variables, even when the interlocked
		distribution of the two variables is not known. Interacts with
		Thomas Lumley's 'survey' package, as described in Lumley,
		Thomas (2011, ISBN:978-1-118-21093-2). Adds additional
		functionality, more adaptable syntax, and error-checking to the
		base weighting functionality in 'survey.'
