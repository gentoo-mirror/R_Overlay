		Multi-Criteria Method for Decision (TOPSIS) // Assists in the
		TOPSIS analysis process, designed to return at the end of the
		answer of the TOPSIS multicriteria analysis,  a ranking table
		with the best option as the analysis proposes. TOPSIS is
		basically a technique developed by Hwang and Yoon in 1981,
		starting from the point that the best alternative should be
		closest to the positive ideal solution and farthest from the
		negative one, based on several criteria to result in the best
		benefit. (LIU, H. et al., 2019)
