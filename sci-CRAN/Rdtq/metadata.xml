		Density Tracking by Quadrature // Implementation of density
		tracking by quadrature (DTQ) algorithms for stochastic
		differential equations (SDEs).  DTQ algorithms numerically
		compute the density function of the solution of an SDE with
		user-specified drift and diffusion functions.  The calculation
		does not require generation of sample paths, but instead
		proceeds in a deterministic fashion by repeatedly applying
		quadrature to the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation associated with a
		discrete-time approximation of the SDE.  The DTQ algorithm is
		provably convergent.  For several practical problems of
		interest, we have found the DTQ algorithm to be fast, accurate,
		and easy to use.
