		Production Function Output Gap Estimation // The output gap
		indicates the percentage difference between the actual output
		of an economy and its potential. Since potential output is a
		latent process, the estimation of the output gap poses a
		challenge and numerous filtering techniques have been proposed.
		'RGAP' facilitates the estimation of a Cobb-Douglas production
		function type output gap, as suggested by the European
		Commission (Havik et al. 2014)
		https://ideas.repec.org/p/euf/ecopap/0535.html. To that end,
		the non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment (NAWRU) and the
		trend of total factor productivity (TFP) can be estimated in
		two bivariate unobserved component models by means of Kalman
		filtering and smoothing. 'RGAP' features a flexible modeling
		framework for the appropriate state-space models and offers
		frequentist as well as Bayesian estimation techniques.
		Additional functionalities include direct access to the 'AMECO'
		https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-research-and-
		databases/economic-databases/ameco-database_en database and
		automated model selection procedures. See the paper by
		Streicher (2022) http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/552089 for
