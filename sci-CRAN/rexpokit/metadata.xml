		R Wrappers for EXPOKIT; Other Matrix Functions // Wraps some of
		the matrix exponentiation utilities from EXPOKIT
		(http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/), a FORTRAN library that
		is widely recommended for matrix exponentiation (Sidje RB,
		1998. "Expokit: A Software Package for Computing Matrix
		Exponentials." ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 24(1): 130-156).
		EXPOKIT includes functions for exponentiating both small, dense
		matrices, and large, sparse matrices (in sparse matrices, most
		of the cells have value 0). Rapid matrix exponentiation is
		useful in phylogenetics when we have a large number of states
		(as we do when we are inferring the history of transitions
		between the possible geographic ranges of a species), but is
		probably useful in other ways as well.
