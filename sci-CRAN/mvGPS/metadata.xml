		Causal Inference using Multivariate Generalized Propensity Score
		// Methods for estimating weights and generalized propensity
		score for multiple continuous exposures via the generalized
		propensity score described in Williams, J.R, and Cresi, C.M
		(2020) arxiv:2008.13767. Weights are constructed assuming an
		underlying multivariate normal density for the marginal and
		conditional distribution of exposures given a set of
		confounders. These weights can then be used to estimate dose-
		response curves or surfaces. This method achieves balance
		across all exposure dimension rather than along a single
		dimension.
