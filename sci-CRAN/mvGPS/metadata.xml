		Causal Inference using Multivariate Generalized Propensity Score
		// Methods for estimating and utilizing the multivariate
		generalized propensity score (mvGPS) for multiple continuous
		exposures described in Williams, J.R, and Crespi, C.M. (2020)
		arxiv:2008.13767. The methods allow estimation of a dose-
		response surface relating the joint distribution of multiple
		continuous exposure variables to an outcome. Weights are
		constructed assuming a multivariate normal density for the
		marginal and conditional distribution of exposures given a set
		of confounders. Confounders can be different for different
		exposure variables. The weights are designed to achieve balance
		across all exposure dimensions and can be used to estimate
		dose-response surfaces.
