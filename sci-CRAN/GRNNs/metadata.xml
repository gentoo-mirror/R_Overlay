		General Regression Neural Networks Package // This General
		Regression Neural Networks Package uses various distance
		functions. It was motivated by Specht (1991, ISBN:1045-9227),
		and updated from previous published paper Li et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.11.005. This package includes various
		functions, although "euclidean" distance is used traditionally.
