		Explore the Exact Bootstrap Method // Researchers often use the
		bootstrap to understand a sample drawn from a population with
		unknown distribution. The exact bootstrap method is a practical
		tool for exploring the distribution of small sample size data.
		For a sample of size n, the exact bootstrap method generates
		the entire space of n to the power of n resamples and
		calculates all realizations of the selected statistic. The
		'exactamente' package includes functions for implementing two
		bootstrap methods, the exact bootstrap and the regular
		bootstrap. The exact_bootstrap() function applies the exact
		bootstrap method following methodologies outlined in
		Kisielinska (2013) doi:10.1007/s00180-012-0350-0. The
		regular_bootstrap() function offers a more traditional
		bootstrap approach, where users can determine the number of
		resamples. The e_vs_r() function allows users to directly
		compare results from these bootstrap methods. To augment user
		experience, 'exactamente' includes the function
		exactamente_app() which launches an interactive 'shiny' web
		application. This application facilitates exploration and
		comparison of the bootstrap methods, providing options for
		modifying various parameters and visualizing results.
