		Bayesian Spectral Analysis Models using Gaussian Process Priors
		// Contains functions to perform Bayesian inference using a
		spectral analysis of Gaussian process priors. Gaussian
		processes are represented with a Fourier series based on cosine
		basis functions. Currently the package includes parametric
		linear models, partial linear additive models with/without
		shape restrictions, generalized linear additive models
		with/without shape restrictions, and density estimation model.
		To maximize computational efficiency, the actual Markov chain
		Monte Carlo sampling for each model is done using codes written
		in FORTRAN 90.
