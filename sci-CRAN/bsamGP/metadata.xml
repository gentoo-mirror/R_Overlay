		Bayesian Spectral Analysis Models using Gaussian Process Priors
		// Contains functions to perform Bayesian inference using a
		spectral analysis of Gaussian process priors. Gaussian
		processes are represented with a Fourier series based on cosine
		basis functions. Currently the package includes parametric
		linear models, partial linear additive models with/without
		shape restrictions, generalized linear additive models
		with/without shape restrictions, and density estimation model.
		To maximize computational efficiency, the actual Markov chain
		Monte Carlo sampling for each model is done using codes written
		in FORTRAN 90. This software has been developed using funding
		supported by Basic Science Research Program through the
		National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the
		Ministry of Education (no. NRF-2016R1D1A1B03932178 and no. NRF-
		2017R1D1A3B03035235).
