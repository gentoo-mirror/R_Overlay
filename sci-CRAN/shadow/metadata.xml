		Geometric Shadow Calculations // Functions for calculating: (1)
		shadow height, (2) logical shadow flag, (3) shadow footprint,
		(4) Sky View Factor and (5) radiation load. Basic required
		inputs include a polygonal layer of obstacle outlines along
		with their heights (i.e. "extruded polygons"), sun azimuth and
		sun elevation. The package also provides functions for related
		preliminary calculations: breaking polygons into line segments,
		determining azimuth of line segments, shifting segments by
		azimuth and distance, constructing the footprint of a line-of-
		sight between an observer and the sun, and creating a 3D grid
		covering the surface area of extruded polygons.
