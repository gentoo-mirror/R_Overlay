		Geometric Shadow Calculations // Functions for calculating (1)
		shadow heights; (2) shadow footprint on ground polygons; and
		(3) Sky View Factor values. Inputs include a polygonal layer of
		obstacle outlines along with their heights, sun azimuth and sun
		elevation. The package also provides functions for related
		preliminary calculations: breaking polygons into line segments,
		finding segment azimuth, shifting segments by azimuth and
		distance, constructing the footprint of a line-of-sight between
		an observer and the sun, and creating a 3D grid covering
		surface area of extruded polygons.
