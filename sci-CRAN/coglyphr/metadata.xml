		Compute Glyph Centers of Gravity from Image Data // Computes the
		center of gravity (COG) of character-like binary images using
		three different methods. This package provides functions for
		estimating stroke-based, contour-based, and potential energy-
		based COG. It is useful for analyzing glyph structure in areas
		such as visual cognition research and font development. The
		contour-based method was originally proposed by Kotani et al.
		(2004) https://ipsj.ixsq.nii.ac.jp/records/36793 and Kotani
		(2011) https://shonan-it.repo.nii.ac.jp/records/2000243, while
		the potential energy-based method was introduced by Kotani et
		al. (2006) doi:10.11371/iieej.35.296.
