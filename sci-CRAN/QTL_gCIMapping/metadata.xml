		QTL Genome-Wide Composite Interval Mapping // Conduct multi-
		Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping under the framework of
		random-QTL-effect mixed linear model. First, each position on
		the genome is detected in order to construct a negative
		logarithm P-value curve against genome position. Then, all the
		peaks on each effect (additive or dominant) curve are viewed as
		potential QTL, all the effects of the potential QTL are
		included in a multi-QTL model, their effects are estimated by
		empirical Bayes in doubled haploid or by adaptive lasso in F2,
		and true QTL are identified by likelihood radio test. Wang S-B,
