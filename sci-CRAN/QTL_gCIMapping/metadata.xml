		QTL Genome-Wide Composite Interval Mapping // Conduct multiple
		quantitative trait loci (QTL) and QTL-by-environment
		interaction (QEI) mapping via ordinary or compressed variance
		component mixed models with random- or fixed QTL/QEI effects.
		First, each position on the genome is detected in order to
		obtain a negative logarithm P-value curve against genome
		position. Then, all the peaks on each effect (additive or
		dominant) curve or on each locus curve are viewed as potential
		main-effect QTLs and QEIs, all their effects are included in a
		multi-locus model, their effects are estimated by both least
		angle regression and empirical Bayes (or adaptive lasso) in
		backcross and F2 populations, and true QTLs and QEIs are
		identified by likelihood radio test. See Zhou et al. (2022)
