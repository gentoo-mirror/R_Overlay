		Crew Launcher Plugins for Traditional High-Performance Computing
		Clusters // In computationally demanding analysis projects,
		statisticians and data scientists asynchronously deploy long-
		running tasks to distributed systems, ranging from traditional
		clusters to cloud services. The 'crew.cluster' package extends
		the 'mirai'-powered 'crew' package with worker launcher plugins
		for traditional high-performance computing systems. Inspiration
		also comes from packages 'mirai' by Gao (2023)
