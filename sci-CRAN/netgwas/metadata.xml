		Network-Based Genome Wide Association Studies // A multi-core R
		package that contains a set of tools based on copula graphical
		models for accomplishing the three interrelated goals in
		genetics and genomics in an unified way: (1) linkage map
		construction, (2) constructing linkage disequilibrium networks,
		and (3) exploring high-dimensional genotype-phenotype network
		and genotype- phenotype-environment interactions networks. The
		'netgwas' package can deal with biparental inbreeding and
		outbreeding species with any ploidy level, namely diploid (2
		sets of chromosomes), triploid (3 sets of chromosomes),
		tetraploid (4 sets of chromosomes) and so on. We target on
		high-dimensional data where number of variables p is
		considerably larger than number of sample sizes (p  n). The
		computations is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix
		output. The 'netgwas' implements the methodological
		developments in Behrouzi and Wit (2017) doi:10.1111/rssc.12287
		and Behrouzi and Wit (2017) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty777.
