		Network-Based Genome Wide Association Studies // A multi-core R
		package that contains a set of tools based on undirected
		graphical models for accomplishing three important and
		interrelated goals in genetics: (1) linkage map construction,
		(2) reconstructing intra- and inter-chromosomal conditional
		interactions (linkage disequilibrium) network, and (3)
		exploring high-dimensional genotype-phenotype network and
		genotype-phenotype-environment interactions network. For this
		purpose, we use conditional (in)dependence relationships
		between variables. The netgwas package can deal with biparental
		inbreeding and outbreeding species with any ploidy level,
		namely diploid (2 sets of chromosomes), triploid (3 sets of
		chromosomes), tetraploid (4 sets of chromosomes) and so on. We
		target on high-dimensional data where number of variables p is
		larger than number of sample sizes (p  n). The computations is
		memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. The package is
		implemented the recent developments in Behrouzi and Wit (2017)
		arXiv:1710.00894 and Behrouzi and Wit (2017) arXiv:1710.01063 .
