		Roster Generation of Turn for Weekdays:'warabandi' // It
		generates the roster of turn for an outlet which is flowing
		(water) 24X7 or 168 hours towards the area under command or
		agricutural area (to be irrigated). The area under command is
		differentially owned by different individual farmers. The
		Outlet runs for free of cost to irrigate the area under command
		24X7. So, flow time of the outlet has to be divided based on an
		area owned by an individual farmer and the location of his land
		or farm. This roster is known as 'warabandi' and its generation
		in agriculture practices is a very tedious task. Calculations
		of time in microseconds are more error-prone, especially
		whenever it is performed by hands. That division of flow time
		for an individual farmer can be calculated by 'warabandi'.
		However, it generates a full publishable report for an outlet
		and all the farmers who have farms subjected to be irrigated.
		It reduces error risk and makes a more reproducible roster. For
		more details about warabandi system you can found elsewhere in
		Bandaragoda DJ(1995)
