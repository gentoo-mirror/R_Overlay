		Modeling the Kinetics of Carbon Dioxide Production in Alcoholic
		Fermentation // Developed to help researchers who need to model
		the kinetics of carbon dioxide (CO2) production in alcoholic
		fermentation of wines, beers and other fermented products. The
		following models are available for modeling the carbon dioxide
		production curve as a function of time: 5PL, Gompertz and 4PL.
		This package has different functions, which applied can:
		perform the modeling of the data obtained in the fermentation
		and return the coefficients, analyze the model fit and return
		different statistical metrics, and calculate the kinetic
		parameters: Maximum production of carbon dioxide; Maximum rate
		of production of carbon dioxide; Moment in which maximum
		fermentation rate occurs; Duration of the latency phase for
		carbon dioxide production; Carbon dioxide produced until
		maximum fermentation rate occurs. In addition, a function that
		generates graphs with the observed and predicted data from the
		models, isolated and combined, is available. Gava, A., Borsato,
		D.,  Ficagna, E. (2020)."Effect of mixture of fining agents on
		the fermentation kinetics of base wine for sparkling wine
