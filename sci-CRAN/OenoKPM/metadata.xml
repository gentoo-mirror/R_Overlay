		Modeling the Kinetics of CO2 Production in Alcoholic Fermentation
		// Developed to help researchers who need to model the kinetics
		of carbon dioxide (CO2) production in alcoholic fermentation of
		wines, beers and other fermented products. The following models
		are available for modeling the CO2 production curve as a
		function of time: 5PL, Gompertz and 4PL. This package has
		different functions, which applied can: perform the modeling of
		the data obtained in the fermentation and return the
		coefficients, analyze the model fit and return different
		statistical metrics, and calculate the kinetic parameters:
		Maximum production of carbon dioxide; Maximum rate of
		production of CO2; Moment in which maximum fermentation rate
		occurs; Duration of the latency phase for CO2 production; CO2
		Produced until Maximum fermentation rate occurs. In addition, a
		function that generates graphs with the observed and predicted
		data from the models, isolated and combined, is available.
