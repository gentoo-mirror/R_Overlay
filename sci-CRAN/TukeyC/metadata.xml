		Conventional Tukey Test // Provides tools to perform multiple
		comparison analyses, based on the well-known Tukey's "Honestly
		Significant Difference" (HSD) test. In models involving
		interactions, 'TukeyC' stands out from other R packages by
		implementing intuitive and easy-to-use functions. In addition
		to accommodating traditional R methods such as lm() and aov(),
		it has also been extended to objects of the lmer() class, that
		is, mixed models with fixed effects. For more details see Tukey
		(1949) doi:10.2307/3001913.
