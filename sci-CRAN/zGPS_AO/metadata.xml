		Zero Inflated Gamma Poisson Shrinker with Adverse Event Ontology
		// The method zGPS.AO (Zero Inflated Gamma Poisson Shrinker
		with AE (Adverse Event) ontology) is based on the zero-inflated
		negative binomial distribution. It estimates the association
		between a specific vaccine and an adverse event group, as well
		as associations between that vaccine and individual adverse
		events within the adverse event group. This model handles the
		adverse event count data with excess zeros and over-dispersion,
		and it allows borrowing information from adverse event data in
		the same group. Details can be found in  "Data Mining in Large
		Frequency Tables With Ontology, with an Application to the
		Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System." Bangyao Zhao, Lili
		Zhao (2020) arXiv:2010.12471.
