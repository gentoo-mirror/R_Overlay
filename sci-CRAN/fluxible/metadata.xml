		Ecosystem Gas Fluxes Calculations for Closed Loop Chamber Setup
		// Toolbox to process raw data from closed loop flux chamber
		(or tent) setups into ecosystem gas fluxes usable for analysis.
		It goes from a data frame of gas concentration over time (which
		can contain several measurements) and a meta data file
		indicating which measurement was done when, to a data frame of
		ecosystem gas fluxes including quality diagnostics. Organized
		with one function per step, maximizing user flexibility and
		backwards compatibility. Different models to estimate the
		fluxes from the raw data are available: exponential as
		described in Zhao et al (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.08.022, exponential as described
		in Hutchinson and Mosier (1981)
		doi:10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500020017x, quadratic, and
		linear. Other functions include quality assessment, plotting
		for visual check, calculation of fluxes based on the setup
		specific parameters (chamber size, plot area, ...), gross
		primary production and transpiration rate calculation, and
		light response curves.
