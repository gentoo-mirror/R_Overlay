		Useful Wrappers Around Commonly Used Functions // The main
		functionalities of 'wrappedtools' are: adding backticks to
		variable names; rounding to desired precision with special case
		for p-values; selecting columns based on pattern and storing
		their position, name, and backticked name; computing and
		formatting of descriptive statistics (e.g. meanSD), comparing
		groups and creating publication-ready tables with descriptive
		statistics and p-values; creating specialized plots for
		correlation matrices. Functions were mainly written for my own
		daily work or teaching, but may be of use to others as well.
