		Analysis of Cost Allocation for Airport Problems // Airport
		problems, introduced by Littlechild and Owen (1973)
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/2629727, are cost allocation
		problems where agents share the cost of a facility (or service)
		based on their ordered needs. Valid allocations must satisfy
		no-subsidy constraints, meaning that no group of agents
		contributes more than the highest cost of its members (i.e., no
		agent is allowed to subsidize another). A rule is a mechanism
		that selects an allocation vector for a given problem. This
		package computes several rules proposed in the literature,
		including both standard rules and their variants, such as
		weighted versions, rules for clones, and rules based on the
		agents hierarchy order. These rules can be applied to various
		problems of interest, including the allocation of liabilities
		and the maintenance of irrigation systems, among others.
		Moreover, the package provides functions for graphical
		representation, enabling users to visually compare the outcomes
		produced by each rule, or to display the no-subsidy set. In
		addition, it includes four datasets illustrating different
		applications and examples of airport problems. For a more
		detailed explanation of all concepts, see Thomson (2024)
