		Test for Monotonicity in Expected Asset Returns, Sorted by
		Portfolios // Test for monotonicity in financial variables
		sorted by portfolios. It is conventional practice in empirical
		research to form portfolios of assets ranked by a certain sort
		variable. A t-test is then used to consider the mean return
		spread between the portfolios with the highest and lowest
		values of the sort variable. Yet comparing only the average
		returns on the top and bottom portfolios does not provide a
		sufficient way to test for a monotonic relation between
		expected returns and the sort variable. This package provides
		nonparametric tests for the full set of monotonic patterns by
		Patton, A. and Timmermann, A. (2010)
		doi:10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.06.006 and compares the proposed
		results with extant alternatives such as t-tests, Bonferroni
		bounds, and multivariate inequality tests through empirical
		applications and simulations.
