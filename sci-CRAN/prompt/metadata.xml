		Dynamic 'R' Prompt // Set the 'R' prompt dynamically, from a
		function. The package contains some examples to include various
		useful dynamic information in the prompt: the status of the
		last command (success or failure); the amount of memory
		allocated by the current 'R' process; the name of the R
		package(s) loaded by 'pkgload' and/or 'devtools'; various 'git'
		information: the name of the active branch, whether it is
		dirty, if it needs pushes pulls. You can also create your own
		prompt if you don't like the predefined examples.
