		Evolutionary Trait Divergence Between Sister Species and Other
		Paired Lineages // Compares the fit of alternative models of
		continuous trait differentiation between sister species and
		other paired lineages. Differences in trait means between two
		lineages arise as they diverge from a common ancestor, and
		alternative processes of evolutionary divergence are expected
		to leave unique signatures in the distribution of trait
		differentiation in datasets comprised of many lineage pairs.
		Models include approximations of divergent selection, drift,
		and stabilizing selection. A variety of model extensions
		facilitate the testing of process-to-pattern hypotheses. Users
		supply trait data and divergence times for each lineage pair.
		The fit of alternative models is compared in a likelihood
		framework.
