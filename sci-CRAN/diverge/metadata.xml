		Evolutionary Trait Divergence Between Sister Species and Other
		Paired Lineages // Compares alternative models of continuous
		trait differentiation in sister species and other paired
		lineages. Alternative models include approximations of
		divergent selection, drift, and stabilizing selection, plus a
		variety of extensions to facilitate the testing of process-to-
		pattern hypotheses. Alternative processes are expected to leave
		unique signatures in the distribution of trait differentiation
		in datasets comprised of many species pairs. Users supply
		species pair trait data and divergence times. The fit of
		alternative models is compared in a likelihood framework.
