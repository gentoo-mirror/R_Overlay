		Generic Coordinate System Transformations Using 'PROJ' // A
		wrapper around the generic coordinate transformation software
		'PROJ' that transforms coordinates from one coordinate
		reference system ('CRS') to another. This includes cartographic
		projections as well as geodetic transformations.  The intention
		is for this package to be used by user-packages such as
		'reproj', and that the older 'PROJ.4' and version 5 pathways be
		provided by the 'proj4' package.
