		Generic Coordinate System Transformations Using 'PROJ' // A
		wrapper around the generic coordinate transformation software
		'PROJ' that transforms geospatial coordinates from one
		coordinate reference system ('CRS') to another. This includes
		cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations.
		Version 6.0.0 or higher is required. The intention is for this
		package to be used by user-packages such as 'reproj', and that
		the older 'PROJ.4' and version 5 pathways be provided by the
		legacy package. The 'PROJ' library is available from
		https://proj.org/.
