		Generic Coordinate System Transformations Using 'PROJ' // A
		wrapper around the generic coordinate transformation software
		'PROJ' that transforms geospatial coordinates from one
		coordinate reference system ('CRS') to another. This includes
		cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations.
		Version 7.1.0-1 or higher of the R package 'libproj' is
		required. The intention is for this package to be used by user-
		packages such as 'reproj', and that the older 'PROJ.4' and
		version 5 pathways be provided by the 'proj4' package.
		Separating this disruptive version change (from 4.0 and 5.0, to
		6.0 and above) allows the use of existing and stable code in
		'proj4' alongside the new idioms and requirements of modern
		'PROJ'. For control of metadata files for the 'PROJ' library,
		see tools in the 'libproj' package.
