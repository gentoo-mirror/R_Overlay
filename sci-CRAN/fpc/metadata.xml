		Flexible Procedures for Clustering // Various methods for
		clustering and cluster validation. Fixed point clustering.
		Linear regression clustering. Clustering by merging Gaussian
		mixture components. Symmetric and asymmetric discriminant
		projections for visualisation of the separation of groupings.
		Cluster validation statistics for distance based clustering
		including corrected Rand index. Standardisation of cluster
		validation statistics by random clusterings and comparison
		between many clustering methods and numbers of clusters based
		on this. Cluster-wise cluster stability assessment. Methods for
		estimation of the number of clusters: Calinski-Harabasz,
		Tibshirani and Walther's prediction strength, Fang and Wang's
		bootstrap stability. Gaussian/multinomial mixture fitting for
		mixed continuous/categorical variables. Variable-wise
		statistics for cluster interpretation. DBSCAN clustering.
		Interface functions for many clustering methods implemented in
		R, including estimating the number of clusters with kmeans, pam
		and clara. Modality diagnosis for Gaussian mixtures. For an
		overview see package?fpc.
