		Flexible procedures for clustering // Various methods for
		clustering and cluster validation. Fixed point clustering.
		Linear regression clustering. Clustering by merging Gaussian
		mixture components. Symmetric and asymmetric discriminant
		projections for visualisation of the separation of groupings.
		Cluster validation statistics for distance based clustering
		including corrected Rand index. Cluster-wise cluster stability
		assessment. Methods for estimation of the number of clusters:
		Calinski-Harabasz, Tibshirani and Walther's prediction
		strength, Fang and Wang's bootstrap stability.
		Gaussian/multinomial mixture fitting for mixed
		continuous/categorical variables. Variable-wise statistics for
		cluster interpretation. DBSCAN clustering. Interface functions
		for many clustering methods implemented in R, including
		estimating the number of clusters with kmeans, pam and clara.
		Modality diagnosis for Gaussian mixtures. For an overview see
		package?fpc.
