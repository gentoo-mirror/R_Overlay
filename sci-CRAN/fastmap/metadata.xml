		Fast Data Structures // Fast implementation of data structures,
		including a key-value store, stack, and queue. Environments are
		commonly used as key-value stores in R, but every time a new
		key is used, it is added to R's global symbol table, causing a
		small amount of memory leakage. This can be problematic in
		cases where many different keys are used. Fastmap avoids this
		memory leak issue by implementing the map using data structures
		in C++.
