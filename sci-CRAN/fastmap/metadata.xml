		Fast Implementation of a Key-Value Store // Fast implementation
		of a key-value store. Environments are commonly used as key-
		value stores, but every time a new key is used, it is added to
		R's global symbol table, causing a small amount of memory
		leakage. This can be problematic in cases where many different
		keys are used. Fastmap avoids this memory leak issue by
		implementing the map using data structures in C++.
