		Simulation-Based Inference using a Metamodel for Log-Likelihood
		Estimator // Parameter inference methods for models defined
		implicitly using a random simulator. Inference is carried out
		using simulation-based estimates of the log-likelihood of the
		data. The inference methods implemented in this package are
		explained in Park, J. (2025) doi:10.48550/arxiv.2311.09446.
		These methods are built on a simulation metamodel which assumes
		that the estimates of the log-likelihood are approximately
		normally distributed with the mean function that is locally
		quadratic around its maximum. Parameter estimation and
		uncertainty quantification can be carried out using the ht()
		function (for hypothesis testing) and the ci() function (for
		constructing a confidence interval for one-dimensional
		parameters).
