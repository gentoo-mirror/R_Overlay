		Utility Functions for 'SQLite' // A tool for working with
		'SQLite' databases. 'SQLite' has some idiosyncrasies and
		limitations that impose some hurdles to the R developer who is
		using this database as a repository. For instance, 'SQLite'
		doesn't have a date type and 'sqliteutils' has some functions
		to deal with that.
