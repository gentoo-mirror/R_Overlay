		Importing and Analysing 'SNP' and 'Silicodart' Data Generated by
		Genome-Wide Restriction Fragment Analysis // Functions are
		provided that facilitate the import and analysis of 'SNP'
		(single nucleotide polymorphism) and 'silicodart'
		(presence/absence) data. The main focus is on data generated by
		'DarT' (Diversity Arrays Technology), however, data from other
		sequencing platforms can be used once 'SNP' or related fragment
		presence/absence data from any source is imported. Genetic
		datasets are stored in a derived 'genlight' format (package
		'adegenet'), that allows for a very compact storage of data and
		metadata. Functions are available for importing and exporting
		of 'SNP' and 'silicodart' data, for reporting on and filtering
		on various criteria (e.g. 'CallRate', heterozygosity,
		reproducibility, maximum allele frequency). Additional
		functions are available for visualization (e.g. Principle
		Coordinate Analysis) and creating a spatial representation
		using maps. 'dartR' supports also the analysis of 3rd party
		software package such as 'newhybrid', 'structure',
		'NeEstimator' and 'blast'. Since version 2.0.3 we also
		implemented simulation functions, that allow to forward
		simulate 'SNP' dynamics under different population and
		evolutionary dynamics. Comprehensive tutorials and support can
		be found at our 'github' repository: github.com/green-striped-
		gecko/dartR/. If you want to cite 'dartR', you find the
		information by typing citation('dartR') in the console.
