		Importing and Analysing Snp and Silicodart Data Generated by
		Genome-Wide Restriction Fragment Analysis // Functions are
		provided that facilitate the import and analysis of snp and
		silicodart (presence/absence) data. The main focus is on data
		generated by DarT (Diversity Arrays Technology). However, once
		SNP or related fragment presence/absence data from any source
		is imported into a genlight object many of the functions can be
		used. Functions are available for input and output of snp and
		silicodart data, for reporting on and filtering on various
		criteria (e.g. CallRate, Heterozygosity, Reproducibility,
		maximum allele frequency). Advanced filtering is based on
		Linkage Disequilibrium and HWE. Other functions are available
		for visualization after PCoA, or to facilitate transfer of data
		between genlight/genind objects and newhybrids, related, phylip
		packages etc.
