		Importing and Analysing SNP and Silicodart Data Generated by
		Genome-Wide Restriction Fragment Analysis // Functions are
		provided that facilitate the import and analysis of SNP (single
		nucleotide polymorphism) and silicodart (presence/absence)
		data. The main focus is on data generated by DarT (Diversity
		Arrays Technology). However, once SNP or related fragment
		presence/absence data from any source is imported into a
		genlight object many of the functions can be used. Functions
		are available for input and output of SNP and silicodart data,
		for reporting on and filtering on various criteria (e.g.
		CallRate, Heterozygosity, Reproducibility, maximum allele
		frequency). Advanced filtering is based on Linkage
		Disequilibrium and HWE (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). Other
		functions are available for visualization after PCoA (Principle
		Coordinate Analysis), or to facilitate transfer of data between
		genlight/genind objects and newhybrids, related, phylip,
		structure, faststructure packages.
