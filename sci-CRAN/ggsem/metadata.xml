		Interactively Visualize Structural Equation Modeling Diagrams //
		It is an R package and web-based application, allowing users to
		perform interactive and reproducible visualizations of path
		diagrams for structural equation modeling (SEM) and networks
		using the 'ggplot2' engine. Its app (built with 'shiny')
		provides an interface that allows extensive customization, and
		creates CSV outputs, which can then be used to recreate the
		figures either using the web app or script-based workflow.
