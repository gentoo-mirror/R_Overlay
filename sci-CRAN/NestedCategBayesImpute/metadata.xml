		Modeling, Imputing and Generating Synthetic Versions of Nested
		Categorical Data in the Presence of Impossible Combinations //
		This tool set provides a set of functions to fit the nested
		Dirichlet process mixture of products of multinomial
		distributions (NDPMPM) model for nested categorical household
		data in the presence of impossible combinations. It has direct
		applications in imputing missing values for and generating
		synthetic versions of nested household data.
