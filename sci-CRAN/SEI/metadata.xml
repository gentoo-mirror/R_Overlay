		Calculating Standardised Indices // Convert a time series of
		observations to a time series of standardised indices that can
		be used to monitor variables on a common and probabilistically
		interpretable scale. The indices can be aggregated and rescaled
		to different time scales, visualised using plot capabilities,
		and calculated using a range of distributions. This includes
		flexible non- and semi-parametric methods, as suggested by
		Allen and Otero (2023) doi:10.1016/j.renene.2023.119206.
