		Longitudinal Bayesian Historical Borrowing Models // Historical
		borrowing in clinical trials can improve precision and
		operating characteristics. This package supports a longitudinal
		hierarchical model to borrow historical control data from other
		studies to better characterize the control response of the
		current study. It also quantifies the amount of borrowing
		through longitudinal benchmark models (independent and pooled).
		The hierarchical model approach to historical borrowing is
		discussed by Viele et al. (2013) doi:10.1002/pst.1589.
