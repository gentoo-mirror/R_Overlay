		Robust Panel Clustering Algorithm // Performs both classical and
		robust panel clustering by applying Principal Component
		Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and clustering via
		standard K-Means or Trimmed K-Means. The method is designed to
		ensure stable and reliable clustering, even in the presence of
		outliers. Suitable for analyzing panel data in domains such as
		economic research, financial time-series, healthcare analytics,
		and social sciences. The package allows users to choose between
		classical K-Means for standard clustering and Trimmed K-Means
		for robust clustering, making it a flexible tool for various
		applications. For this package, we have benefited from the
		studies Rencher (2003), Wang and Lu (2021)
