		Import, Recompute and Analyze Data from Portable Gas Analyzers //
		The gasanalyzer R package offers methods for importing,
		preprocessing, and analyzing data related to photosynthetic
		characteristics (gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and
		isotope ratios). It translates variable names into a standard
		format, and can recalculate derived, physiological quantities
		using imported or predefined equations. The package also allows
		users to assess the sensitivity of their results to different
		assumptions used in the calculations. See also Tholen (2024)
