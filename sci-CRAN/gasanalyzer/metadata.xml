		Import, Recompute and Analyze Data from Portable Gas Analyzers //
		Provides functions to import data from several instruments
		commonly used by plant physiologists to measure characteristics
		related to photosynthesis. It provides a standardized list of
		variable names, and several sets of equations to calculate
		additional variables based on the measurements.  These
		equations have been described by von Caemmerer and Farquhar
		(1981) doi:10.1007/BF00384257, Busch et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1038/s41477-020-0606-6 and Mrquez et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1038/s41477-021-00861-w. In addition, this package
		facilitates performing sensitivity analyses on variables or
		assumptions used in the calculations.
