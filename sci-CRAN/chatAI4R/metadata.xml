		Chat-Based Interactive Artificial Intelligence for R // The Large
		Language Model (LLM) represents a groundbreaking advancement in
		data science and programming, and also allows us to extend the
		world of R. A seamless interface for integrating the 'OpenAI'
		API (see https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), 'Stable
		Diffusion' and other Web APIs into R is provided in this
		package. This package leverages LLM-based AI techniques,
		enabling efficient knowledge discovery and data analysis. In
		addition, this package includes functionality for performing
		image generation such as txt2img (t2i) and img2img (i2i) using
		the 'DALL-E 2' and 'Stable Diffusion' APIs.
