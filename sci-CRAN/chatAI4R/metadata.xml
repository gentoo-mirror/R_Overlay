		Chat-Based Interactive Artificial Intelligence for R // The Large
		Language Model (LLM) represents a groundbreaking advancement in
		data science and programming, and also allows us to extend the
		world of R. A seamless interface for integrating the 'OpenAI'
		Web APIs into R is provided in this package. This package
		leverages LLM-based AI techniques, enabling efficient knowledge
		discovery and data analysis (see 'OpenAI' Web APIs details
		https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). The previous functions
		such as seamless translation and image generation have been
		moved to other packages 'deepRstudio' and 'stableDiffusion4R'.
