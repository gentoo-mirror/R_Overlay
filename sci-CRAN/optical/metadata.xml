		Optimal Item Calibration // The restricted optimal design method
		is implemented to optimally allocate a set of items that
		require calibration to a group of examinees. The optimization
		process is based on the method described in detail by Ul Hassan
		and Miller in their works published in (2019)
		doi:10.1177/0146621618824854 and (2021)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2021.107177. To use the method, preliminary
		item characteristics must be provided as input. These
		characteristics can either be expert guesses or based on
		previous calibration with a small number of examinees. The item
		characteristics should be described in the form of parameters
		for an Item Response Theory (IRT) model. These models can
		include the Rasch model, the 2-parameter logistic model, the
		3-parameter logistic model, or a mixture of these models. The
		output consists of a set of rules for each item that determine
		which examinees should be assigned to each item. The efficiency
		or gain achieved through the optimal design is quantified by
		comparing it to a random allocation. This comparison allows for
		an assessment of how much improvement or advantage is gained by
		using the optimal design approach. This work was supported by
		the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrdet) Grant 2019-02706.
