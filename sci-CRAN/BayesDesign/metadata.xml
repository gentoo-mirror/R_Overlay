		Bayesian Single-Arm Design with Survival Endpoints // The
		proposed event-driven approach for Bayesian two-stage single-
		arm phase II trial design is a novel clinical trial design and
		can be regarded as an extension of the Simons two-stage design
		with the time-to-event endpoint. This design is motivated by
		cancer clinical trials with immunotherapy and molecularly
		targeted therapy, in which time-to-event endpoint is often a
		desired endpoint.
