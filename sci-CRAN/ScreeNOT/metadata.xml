		'ScreeNOT': MSE-Optimal Singular Value Thresholding in Correlated
		Noise // Optimal hard thresholding of singular values. The
		procedure adaptively estimates the best singular value
		threshold under unknown noise characteristics. The threshold
		chosen by 'ScreeNOT' is optimal (asymptotically, in the sense
		of minimum Frobenius error) under the the so-called "Spiked
		model" of a low-rank matrix observed in additive noise. In
		contrast to previous works, the noise is not assumed to be
		i.i.d. or white; it can have an essentially arbitrary and
		unknown correlation structure, across either rows, columns or
		both. 'ScreeNOT' is proposed to practitioners as a
		mathematically solid alternative to Cattell's ever-popular but
		vague Scree Plot heuristic from 1966. If you use this package,
		please cite our paper: David L. Donoho, Matan Gavish and Elad
		Romanov (2023). "ScreeNOT: Exact MSE-optimal singular value
		thresholding in correlated noise." Annals of Statistics, 2023
