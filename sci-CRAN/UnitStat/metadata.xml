		Performs Unit Root Test Statistics // A test to understand the
		stability of the underlying stochastic data. Helps the users
		understand whether the random variable under consideration is
		stationary or non-stationary without any manual interpretation
		of the results. It further ensures to check all the
		prerequisites and assumptions which are underlying the unit
		root test statistics and if the underlying data is found to be
		non-stationary in all the 4 lags the function diagnoses the
		input data and returns with an optimised solution on the same.
