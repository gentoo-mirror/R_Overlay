		Rasch Models -- eXtensions // Extend Rasch and Item Response
		Theory (IRT) analyses by providing tools for post-processing
		the output from five major IRT packages (i.e., 'eRm',
		'psychotools', 'ltm', 'mirt', and 'TAM'). The current version
		provides the plotPIccc() function, which extracts from the
		return object of the originating package all information
		required to draw an extended Person-Item-Map (PIccc), showing
		any combination of * category characteristic curves (CCCs), *
		threshold characteristic curves (TCCs), * item characteristic
		curves (ICCs), * category information functions (CIFs), * item
		information functions (IIFs), * test information function
		(TIF), and the * standard error curve (S.E.). for uni- and
		multidimensional models (as far as supported by each package).
		It allows for selecting dimensions, items, and categories to
		plot and offers numerous options to adapt the output. The
		return object contains all calculated values for further
		processing.
