		'SAS' Linear Model // This is a core implementation of 'SAS'
		procedures for linear models - GLM, REG, ANOVA, FREQ, and
		UNIVARIATE. Some R packages provide type II and type III SS.
		However, the results of nested and complex designs are often
		different from those of 'SAS.' Different results does not
		necessarily mean incorrectness. However, many wants the same
		results to SAS. This package aims to achieve that. Reference:
		Littell RC, Stroup WW, Freund RJ (2002, ISBN:0-471-22174-0).
