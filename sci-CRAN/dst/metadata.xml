		Using the Theory of Belief Functions // Using the Theory of
		Belief Functions for evidence calculus. Basic probability
		assignments, or mass functions, can be defined on the subsets
		of a set of possible values and combined. A mass function can
		be extended to a larger frame. Marginalization, i.e. reduction
		to a smaller frame can also be done. These features can be
		combined to analyze small belief networks and take into account
		situations where information cannot be satisfactorily described
		by probability distributions.
