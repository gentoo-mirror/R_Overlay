		Using Dempster-Shafer Theory // Using Dempster-Shafer Theory of
		Evidence, also called "Theory of Belief Functions". Basic
		probability assignments, or mass functions, can be defined on
		the subsets of a set of possible values. Two mass functions can
		be combined using Dempster's rule of combination. A mass
		function can be extended to a larger frame. Marginalization,
		i.e. reduction to a smaller frame can also be done. These
		features can be combined to analyze small belief networks and
		take into account situations where information cannot be
		satisfactorily described by probability distributions.
