		Inverse Probability Weighted Cox Model with Corrected Sandwich
		Variance // An implementation of corrected sandwich variance
		(CSV) estimation method for making inference of marginal hazard
		ratios (HR) in inverse probability weighted (IPW) Cox model
		without and with clustered data, proposed by Shu, Young, Toh,
		and Wang (2019) in their paper under revision for Biometrics.
		Both conventional inverse probability weights and stabilized
		weights are implemented. Logistic regression model is assumed
		for propensity score model.
