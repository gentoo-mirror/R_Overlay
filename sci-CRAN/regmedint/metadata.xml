		Regression-Based Causal Mediation Analysis with an Interaction
		Term // 'R' implementation of the regression-based causal
		mediation analysis with a treatment-mediator interaction term,
		as originally implemented in the 'SAS' macro by Valeri and
		VanderWeele (2013) doi:10.1037/a0031034 and Valeri and
		VanderWeele (2015) doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000253. Linear and
		logistic models are supported for the mediator model. Linear,
		logistic, loglinear, Poisson, negative binomial, Cox, and
		accelerated failure time (exponential and Weibull) models are
		supported for the outcome model.
