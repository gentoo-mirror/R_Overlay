		Regression-Based Causal Mediation Analysis with Interaction and
		Effect Modification Terms // This is an extension of the
		regression-based causal mediation analysis first proposed by
		Valeri and VanderWeele (2013) doi:10.1037/a0031034 and Valeri
		and VanderWeele (2015) doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000253). It
		supports including effect measure modification by
		covariates(treatment-covariate and mediator-covariate product
		terms in mediator and outcome regression models). It also
		accommodates the original 'SAS' macro and 'PROC CAUSALMED'
		procedure in 'SAS' when there is no effect measure
		modification. Linear and logistic models are supported for the
		mediator model. Linear, logistic, loglinear, Poisson, negative
		binomial, Cox, and accelerated failure time (exponential and
		Weibull) models are supported for the outcome model.
