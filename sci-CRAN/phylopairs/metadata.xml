		Comparative Analyses of Lineage-Pair Traits // Facilitates the
		testing of causal relationships among lineage-pair traits in a
		phylogenetically informed context. Lineage-pair traits are
		characters that are defined for pairs of lineages instead of
		individual taxa. Examples include the strength of reproductive
		isolation, range overlap, competition coefficient, diet niche
		similarity, and relative hybrid fitness. Users supply a
		lineage-pair dataset and a phylogeny. 'phylopairs' calculates a
		covariance matrix for the pairwise-defined data and provides
		built-in models to test for relationships among variables while
		taking this covariance into account. Bayesian sampling is run
		through built-in 'Stan' programs via the 'rstan' package. The
		various models and methods that this package makes available
		are described in Anderson et al. (In Review), Coyne and Orr
		(1989) doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb04233.x, Fitzpatrick
		(2002) doi:10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00860.x, and Castillo
