		Estimate Streamflow Depletion Due to Groundwater Pumping //
		Implementation of analytical models for estimating streamflow
		depletion due to groundwater pumping, and other related tools.
		Functions are broadly split into two groups: (1) analytical
		streamflow depletion models, which estimate streamflow
		depletion for a single stream reach resulting from groundwater
		pumping; and (2) depletion apportionment equations, which
		distribute estimated streamflow depletion among multiple stream
		reaches within a stream network. See Zipper et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1029/2018WR022707 for more information on depletion
		apportionment equations and Zipper et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1029/2018WR024403 for more information on analytical
		depletion functions, which combine analytical models and
		depletion apportionment equations.
