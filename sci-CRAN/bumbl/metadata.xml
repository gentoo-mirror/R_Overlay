		Tools for Modeling Bumblebee Colony Growth and Decline //
		Bumblebee colonies grow during worker production, then decline
		after switching to production of reproductive individuals
		(drones and gynes).  This package provides tools for modeling
		and visualizing this pattern by identifying a switchpoint with
		a growth rate before and a decline rate after the switchpoint.
		The mathematical models fit by bumbl are described in Crone and
		Williams (2016) doi:10.1111/ele.12581.
