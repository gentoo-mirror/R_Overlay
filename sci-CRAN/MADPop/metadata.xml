		MHC Allele-Based Differencing Between Populations // Tools for
		the analysis of population differences using the Major
		Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genotypes of samples having a
		variable number of alleles (1-4) recorded for each individual.
		A hierarchical Dirichlet-Multinomial model on the genotype
		counts is used to pool small samples from multiple populations
		for pairwise tests of equality.  Bayesian inference is
		implemented via the 'rstan' package.  Bootstrapped and
		posterior p-values are provided for chi-squared and likelihood
		ratio tests of equal genotype probabilities.
