		Variable Selection by Revisited Knockoffs Procedures // Performs
		variable selection for many types of L1-regularised regressions
		using the revisited knockoffs procedure. This procedure uses a
		matrix of knockoffs of the covariates independent from the
		response variable Y. The idea is to determine if a covariate
		belongs to the model depending on whether it enters the model
		before or after its knockoff. The procedure suits for a wide
		range of regressions with various types of response variables.
		Regression models available are exported from the R packages
		'glmnet' and 'ordinalNet'. Based on the paper linked to via the
		URL below: Gegout A., Gueudin A., Karmann C. (2019)
		arXiv:1907.03153.
