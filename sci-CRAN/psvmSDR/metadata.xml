		Unified Principal Sufficient Dimension Reduction Package // A
		unified and user-friendly framework for applying the principal
		sufficient dimension reduction methods for both linear and
		nonlinear cases. The package has an extendable power by varying
		loss functions for the support vector machine, even for an
		user-defined arbitrary function, unless those are convex and
		differentiable everywhere over the support (Li et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1214/11-AOS932). Also, it provides a real-time
		sufficient dimension reduction update procedure using the
		principal least squares support vector machine (Artemiou et al.
		(2021) doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107768).
