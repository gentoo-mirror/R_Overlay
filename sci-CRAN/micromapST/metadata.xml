		Linked Micromap Plots for U. S. and Other Geographic Areas //
		Provides the users with the ability to quickly create linked
		micromap plots for a collection of geographic areas. Linked
		micromap plots are visualizations of geo-referenced data that
		link statistical graphics to an organized series of small maps
		or graphic images. The Help description contains examples of
		how to use the 'micromapST' function. Contained in this package
		are border group datasets to support creating linked micromap
		plots for the 50 U.S. states and District of Columbia (51
		areas), the U. S. 20 Seer Registries, the 105 counties in the
		state of Kansas, the 62 counties of New York, the 24 counties
		of Maryland, the 29 counties of Utah, the 32 administrative
		areas in China, the 218 administrative areas in the UK and
		Ireland (for testing only), the 25 districts in the city of
		Seoul South Korea, and the 52 counties on the Africa continent.
		A border group dataset contains the boundaries related to the
		data level areas, a second layer boundaries, a top or third
		layer boundary, a parameter list of run options, and a cross
		indexing table between area names, abbreviations, numeric
		identification and alias matching strings for the specific
		geographic area.  By specifying a border group, the package
		create linked micromap plots for any geographic region. The
		user can create and provide their own border group dataset for
		any area beyond the areas contained within the package with the
		'BuildBorderGroup' function. In April of 2022, it was announced
		that 'maptools', 'rgdal', and 'rgeos' R packages would be
		retired in middle to end of 2023 and removed from the CRAN
		libraries. The 'BuildBorderGroup' function was dependent on
		these packages. 'micromapST' functions were not impacted by the
		retired R packages. Upgrading of 'BuildBorderGroup' function
		was completed and released with version 3.0.0 on August 10,
		2023 using the 'sf' R package. References: Carr and Pickle,
