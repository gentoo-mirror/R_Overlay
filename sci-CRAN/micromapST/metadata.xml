		Linked Micromap Plots for General U. S. Geographic Areas //
		Provides the users with the ability to quickly create Linked
		Micromap plots for a collection of geographic areas. Linked
		Micromaps are visualizations of georeferenced data that link
		statistical graphics to an organized series of small maps or
		graphic images. The Help description contains examples of how
		to use the micromapST function. Contained in this package are
		border group datasets to support creating micromaps for the 50
		U.S. states and District of Columbia (51 areas), the U. S. 20
		Seer Registries, the 105 counties in the state of Kansas, the
		62 counties of New York, the 24 counties of Maryland, the 29
		counties of Utah, the 32 administrative areas in China, the 218
		administrative areas in the UK and Ireland (for testing only),
		the 25 districts in the city of Seoul South Korea, and the 52
		counties on the Africa continent. A border group dataset
		contains the boundaries related to the data level areas, a
		second layer boundaries, a top or third layer boundary, a
		parameter list of run options, and a cross indexing table
		between area names, abbreviations, numeric identification and
		alias matching strings for the specific geographic area.  By
		specifying a border group, the package create micromaps for any
		geographic region.  The user can create and provide their own
		border group dataset for any area beyond the areas contained
		within the package. Copyrighted 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 by
