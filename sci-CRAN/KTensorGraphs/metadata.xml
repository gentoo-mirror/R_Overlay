		Co-Tucker3 Analysis of Two Sequences of Matrices // Provides a
		function called COTUCKER3() (Co-Inertia Analysis + Tucker3
		method) which performs a Co-Tucker3 analysis of two sequences
		of matrices, as well as other functions called PCA() (Principal
		Component Analysis) and BGA() (Between-Groups Analysis), which
		perform analysis of one matrix, COIA() (Co-Inertia Analysis),
		which performs analysis of two matrices, PTA() (Partial Triadic
		Analysis), STATIS(), STATISDUAL() and TUCKER3(), which perform
		analysis of a sequence of matrices, and BGCOIA() (Between-
		Groups Co-Inertia Analysis), STATICO() (STATIS method + Co-
		Inertia Analysis), COSTATIS() (Co-Inertia Analysis + STATIS
		method), which also perform analysis of two sequences of
		matrices.
