		Multi-Level Model Assessment Kit // Multilevel models (mixed
		effects models) are the statistical tool of choice for
		analyzing multilevel data (Searle et al, 2009). These models
		account for the correlated nature of observations within higher
		level units by adding group-level error terms that augment the
		singular residual error of a standard OLS regression.
		Multilevel and mixed effects models often require specialized
		data pre-processing and further post-estimation derivations and
		graphics to gain insight into model results. The package
		presented here, 'mlmtools', is a suite of pre- and post-
		estimation tools for multilevel models in 'R'. Package
		implements post-estimation tools designed to work with models
		estimated using 'lme4''s (Bates et al., 2014) lmer() function,
		which fits linear mixed effects regression models. Searle, S.
		R., Casella, G.,  McCulloch, C. E. (2009, ISBN:978-0470009598).
