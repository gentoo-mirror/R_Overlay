		Sparse Generalized Additive Models // Fits sparse frequentist
		GAMs (SF-GAM) for continuous and discrete responses in the
		exponential dispersion family with the group lasso, group
		smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), and group minimax
		concave (MCP) penalties doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9424-2. Also
		fits sparse Bayesian generalized additive models (SB-GAM) with
		the spike-and-slab group lasso (SSGL) penalty of Bai et al.
		(2021) doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1765784. B-spline basis
		functions are used to model the sparse additive functions.
		Stand-alone functions for group-regularized negative binomial
		regression, group-regularized gamma regression, and group-
		regularized regression in the exponential dispersion family
		with the SSGL penalty are also provided.
