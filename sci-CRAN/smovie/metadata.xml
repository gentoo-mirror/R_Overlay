		Some Movies to Illustrate Concepts in Statistics // Provides
		movies to help students to understand statistical concepts.
		The 'rpanel' package  https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpanel
		is used to create interactive plots that move to illustrate key
		statistical ideas and methods.  There are movies to: visualise
		probability distributions (including user-supplied ones);
		illustrate sampling distributions of the sample mean (central
		limit theorem), the sample maximum (extremal types theorem) and
		(the Fisher transformation of the) Pearson product moment
		correlation coefficient; examine the influence of an individual
		observation in simple linear regression; illustrate key
		concepts in statistical hypothesis testing. Also provided are
		dpqr functions for the distribution of the Fisher
		transformation of the correlation coefficient under sampling
		from a bivariate normal distribution.
