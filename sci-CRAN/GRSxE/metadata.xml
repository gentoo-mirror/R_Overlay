		Testing Gene-Environment Interactions Through Genetic Risk Scores
		// Statistical testing procedures for detecting GxE (gene-
		environment) interactions. The main focus lies on GRSxE
		interaction tests that aim at detecting GxE interactions
		through GRS (genetic risk scores). Moreover, a novel testing
		procedure based on bagging and OOB predictions is implemented
		for incorporating all available observations at both GRS
		construction and GxE testing.
