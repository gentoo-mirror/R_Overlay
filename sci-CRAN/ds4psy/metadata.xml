		Data Science for Psychologists // All data sets required for the
		examples and exercises in the book "Data Science for
		Psychologists" (by Hansjoerg Neth, Konstanz University, 2019),
		freely available at https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/. The
		book and course introduce principles and methods of data
		science to students of psychology and other biological or
		social sciences. The 'ds4psy' package primarily provides
		datasets, but also functions for graphics and text-manipulation
		that are used in the book and its exercises.
