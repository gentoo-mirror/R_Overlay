		Data Science for Psychologists // All datasets and functions
		required for the examples and exercises of the book "Data
		Science for Psychologists" (by Hansjoerg Neth, Konstanz
		University, 2021), available at
		https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/. The book and course
		introduce principles and methods of data science to students of
		psychology and other biological or social sciences. The
		'ds4psy' package primarily provides datasets, but also
		functions for data generation and manipulation (e.g., of text
		and time data) and graphics that are used in the book and its
		exercises. All functions included in 'ds4psy' are designed to
		be explicit and instructive, rather than elegant or efficient.
