		Another Approach to Package Installation // The goal of 'pak' is
		to make package installation faster and more reliable. In
		particular, it performs all HTTP operations in parallel, so
		metadata resolution and package downloads are fast. Metadata
		and package files are cached on the local disk as well. 'pak'
		has a dependency solver, so it finds version conflicts before
		performing the installation. This version of 'pak' supports
		CRAN, 'Bioconductor' and 'GitHub' packages as well.
