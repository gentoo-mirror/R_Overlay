		Rapid and Accurate Genetic Prediction Modeling for Genome-Wide
		Association or Whole-Genome Sequencing Study Data // Rapidly
		build accurate genetic prediction models for genome-wide
		association or whole-genome sequencing study data by smooth-
		threshold multivariate genetic prediction (STMGP) method.
		Variable selection is performed using marginal association test
		p-values with an optimal p-value cutoff selected by Cp-type
		criterion. Quantitative and binary traits are modeled
		respectively via linear and logistic regression models. A
		function that works through PLINK software (Purcell et al. 2007
		DOI:10.1086/519795, Chang et al. 2015
		DOI:10.1186/s13742-015-0047-8) https://www.cog-
		genomics.org/plink2 is provided. Covariates can be included in
		regression model.
