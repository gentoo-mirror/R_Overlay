		RFC 7231 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3
		defining a suggested structure for 'User-Agent' headers this
		data is notoriously difficult to parse consistently. Tools are
		provided that will take in user agent strings and return
		structured R objects. This is a 'V8'-backed package based on
		the 'ua-parser' project https://github.com/ua-parser.
