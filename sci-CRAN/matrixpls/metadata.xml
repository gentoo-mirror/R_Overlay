		Matrix-Based Partial Least Squares Estimation // Partial Least
		Squares Path Modeling algorithm and related algorithms. The
		algorithm implementations aim for computational efficiency
		using matrix algebra and covariance data. The package is
		designed toward Monte Carlo simulations and includes functions
		to perform simple Monte Carlo simulations.
