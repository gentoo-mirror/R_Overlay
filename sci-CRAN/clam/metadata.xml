		Classical Age-Depth Modelling of Cores from Deposits // Performs
		'classical' age-depth modelling of dated sediment deposits -
		prior to applying more sophisticated techniques such as
		Bayesian age-depth modelling. Any radiocarbon dated depths are
		calibrated. Age-depth models are constructed by sampling
		repeatedly from the dated levels, each time drawing age-depth
		curves. Model types include linear interpolation, linear or
		polynomial regression, and a range of splines. See Blaauw
