		Deep Gaussian Mixture Models // Deep Gaussian mixture models as
		proposed by Viroli and McLachlan (2019)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9793-z provide a generalization of
		classical Gaussian mixtures to multiple layers. Each layer
		contains a set of latent variables that follow a mixture of
		Gaussian distributions. To avoid overparameterized solutions,
		dimension reduction is applied at each layer by way of factor
		models.
