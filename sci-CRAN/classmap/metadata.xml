		Visualizing Classification Results by Classmaps // Tools to
		visualize the results of a classification obtained by
		discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector
		machines, for two or more classes. Implements the techniques
		described and illustrated in Raymaekers, Rousseeuw and Hubert
		(2021), Class maps for visualizing classification results,
		Technometrics, to appear. In addition to class maps, also
		stacked plots are made. Examples can be found in the vignettes:
		"Discriminant_analysis_examples","K_nearest_neighbors_examples"
		and "Support_vector_machine_examples".
