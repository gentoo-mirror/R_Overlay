		L1-Regularized Multi-State Models // Fitting the regularization
		path of the L1-regularized multi-state models since they can
		exploit sparsity structure of input. Different tuning
		regularization parameter methods are provided. The cumulative
		hazard rate estimation and the transition probability
		predictions can be made from the fitted models.
