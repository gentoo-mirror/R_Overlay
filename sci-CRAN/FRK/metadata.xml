		Fixed Rank Kriging // Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for spatial
		/spatio-temporal modelling and prediction with large datasets.
		The approach, discussed in Cressie and Johannesson (2008),
		decomposes the field, and hence the covariance function, using
		a fixed set of n basis functions, where n is typically much
		smaller than the number of data points (or polygons) m. The
		method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic
		covariance functions and the use of observations with varying
		support (with known error variance). The projected field is a
		key building block of the Spatial Random Effects (SRE) model,
		on which this package is based. The package FRK provides helper
		functions to model, fit, and predict using an SRE with relative
		ease. Reference: Cressie, N. and Johannesson, G. (2008)
