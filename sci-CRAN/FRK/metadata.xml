		Fixed Rank Kriging // Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for
		spatial/spatio-temporal modelling and prediction with large
		datasets. The approach, discussed in Cressie and Johannesson
		(2008) DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00633.x, decomposes the
		field, and hence the covariance function, using a fixed set of
		n basis functions, where n is typically much smaller than the
		number of data points (or polygons) m. The method naturally
		allows for non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions and
		the use of observations with varying support (with known error
		variance). The projected field is a key building block of the
		Spatial Random Effects (SRE) model, on which this package is
		based. The package FRK provides helper functions to model, fit,
		and predict using an SRE with relative ease.
