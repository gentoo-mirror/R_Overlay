		Fixed Rank Kriging // Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for
		spatial/spatio-temporal modelling and prediction with large
		datasets. The approach models the field, and hence the
		covariance function, using a set of r basis functions, where r
		is typically much smaller than the number of data points (or
		polygons) m. This low-rank basis-function representation
		facilitates the modelling of 'big' spatial/spatio-temporal
		data. The method naturally allows for non-stationary,
		anisotropic covariance functions. Discretisation of the spatial
		domain into so-called basic areal units (BAUs) facilitates the
		use of observations with varying support (i.e., both point-
		referenced and areal supports, potentially simultaneously), and
		prediction over arbitrary user-specified regions. `FRK` also
		supports inference over various manifolds, including the 2D
		plane and 3D sphere, and it provides helper functions to model,
		fit, predict, and plot with relative ease. Version 2.0.0 and
		above of the package `FRK` also supports modelling of non-
		Gaussian data, by employing a spatial generalised linear mixed
		model (GLMM) framework  to cater for Poisson, binomial,
		negative-binomial, gamma, and inverse-Gaussian distributions.
		Zammit-Mangion and Cressie doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i04 describe
		`FRK` in a Gaussian setting, and detail its use of basis
		functions and BAUs.
