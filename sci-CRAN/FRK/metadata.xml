		Fixed Rank Kriging // A tool for spatial/spatio-temporal
		modelling and prediction with large datasets. The approach
		models the field, and hence the covariance function, using a
		set of basis functions. This fixed-rank basis-function
		representation facilitates the modelling of big data, and the
		method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic
		covariance functions. Discretisation of the spatial domain into
		so-called basic areal units (BAUs) facilitates the use of
		observations with varying support (i.e., both point-referenced
		and areal supports, potentially simultaneously), and prediction
		over arbitrary user-specified regions. `FRK` also supports
		inference over various manifolds, including the 2D plane and 3D
		sphere, and it provides helper functions to model, fit,
		predict, and plot with relative ease. Version 2.0.0 and above
		also supports the modelling of non-Gaussian data (e.g.,
		Poisson, binomial, negative-binomial, gamma, and inverse-
		Gaussian) by employing a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM)
		framework. Zammit-Mangion and Cressie doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i04
		describe `FRK` in a Gaussian setting, and detail its use of
		basis functions and BAUs, while Sainsbury-Dale, Zammit-Mangion,
		and Cressie doi:10.18637/jss.v108.i10 describe `FRK` in a non-
		Gaussian setting; two vignettes are available that summarise
		these papers and provide additional examples.
