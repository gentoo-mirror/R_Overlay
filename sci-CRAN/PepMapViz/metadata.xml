		A Versatile Toolkit for Peptide Mapping, Visualization, and
		Comparative Exploration // A versatile R visualization package
		that empowers researchers with comprehensive visualization
		tools for seamlessly mapping peptides to protein sequences,
		identifying distinct domains and regions of interest,
		accentuating mutations, and highlighting post-translational
		modifications, all while enabling comparisons across diverse
		experimental conditions. Potential applications of 'PepMapViz'
		include the visualization of cross-software mass spectrometry
		results at the peptide level for specific protein and domain
		details in a linearized format and post-translational
		modification coverage across different experimental conditions;
		unraveling insights into disease mechanisms. It also enables
		visualization of Major histocompatibility complex-presented
		peptide clusters in different antibody regions predicting
		immunogenicity in antibody drug development.
