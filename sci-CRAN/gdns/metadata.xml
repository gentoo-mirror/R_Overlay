		Tools to Work with Google's 'DNS-over-HTTPS' ('DoH') 'API' // To
		address the problem of insecurity of 'UDP'-based 'DNS'
		requests, 'Google Public DNS' offers 'DNS' resolution over an
		encrypted 'HTTPS' connection. 'DNS-over-HTTPS' greatly enhances
		privacy and security between a client and a recursive resolver,
		and complements 'DNSSEC' to provide end-to-end authenticated
		'DNS' lookups. Functions that enable querying individual
		requests that bulk requests that return detailed responses and
		bulk requests are both provided. Support for reverse lookups is
		also provided. See https://developers.google.com/speed/public-
		dns/docs/dns-over-https for more information.
