		Inference and Prediction in an Illness-Death Model // Newly
		developed methods for the estimation of several probabilities
		in an illness-death model. The package can be used to obtain
		nonparametric and semiparametric estimates for: transition
		probabilities, occupation probabilities, cumulative incidence
		function and the sojourn time distributions. Several auxiliary
		functions are also provided which can be used for marginal
		estimation of the survival functions.
