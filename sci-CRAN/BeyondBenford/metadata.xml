		Compare the Goodness of Fit of Benford's and Blondeau Da Silva's
		Digit Distributions to a Given Dataset // Allows to compare the
		goodness of fit of Benford's and Blondeau Da Silva's digit
		distributions in a dataset. It is used to check whether the
		data distribution is consistent with theoretical distributions
		highlighted by Blondeau Da Silva or not (through the
		dat.distr() function): this ideal theoretical distribution must
		be at least approximately followed by the data for the use of
		Blondeau Da Silva's model to be well-founded. It also enables
		to plot histograms of digit distributions, both observed in the
		dataset and given by the two theoretical approaches (with the
		digit.ditr() function). Finally, it proposes to quantify the
		goodness of fit via Pearson's chi-squared test (with the chi2()
		function).
