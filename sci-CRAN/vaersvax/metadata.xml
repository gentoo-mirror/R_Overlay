		US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Vaccine Data
		for Present // US VAERS vaccine data for 01/01/2018 -
		06/14/2018. If you want to explore the full VAERS data for 1990
		- Present (data, symptoms, and vaccines), then check out the
		'vaers' package from the URL below. The URL and BugReports
		below correspond to the 'vaers' package, of which 'vaersvax' is
		a small subset (2018 only). 'vaers' is not hosted on CRAN due
		to the large size of the data set. To install the Suggested
		'vaers' and 'vaersND' packages, use the following R code:
		'devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaers.git",
		build_vignettes = TRUE)' and
		'devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaersND.git",
		build_vignettes = TRUE)'. "The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
		System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect
		possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is
		co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
		(CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)." For
		more information about the data, visit https://vaers.hhs.gov/.
