		LP Smoothed Inference and Graphics // Classical tests of
		goodness-of-fit aim to validate the conformity of a postulated
		model to the data under study. In their standard formulation,
		however, they do not allow exploring how the hypothesized model
		deviates from the truth nor do they provide any insight into
		how the rejected model could be improved to better fit the
		data. To overcome these shortcomings, we establish a
		comprehensive framework for goodness-of-fit which naturally
		integrates modeling, estimation, inference and graphics. In
		this package, the deviance tests and comparison density plots
		are performed to conduct the LP smoothed inference, where the
		letter L denotes nonparametric methods based on quantiles and P
		stands for polynomials. Simulations methods are used to perform
		variance estimation, inference and post-selection adjustments.
