		Experience Study Tools for Analytics and Communications //
		Provides a data class of 'tbl_es' to help aid in the formation
		and analyses of recurrent or novel experience studies. A
		'tbl_es' has attributes which identify the key variables used
		for calculating metrics under an actuarial perspective. Common
		metrics (such as actual-to-expected analysis) can be quickly
		generated in aggregate or according to different qualitative
		factors. If multiple factors are of interest, grouped metrics
		can be automatically computed for each factor individually as
		well as for all possible combinations. All resulting output can
		then be formatted for presentations or left unformatted for
		subsequent analyses. Ultimately, this package aims to reduce
		time spent completing repetitive code therefore increasing time
		for analysis and insight.
