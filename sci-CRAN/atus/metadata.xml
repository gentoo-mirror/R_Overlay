		American Time Use Survey Data // Abridged data from the American
		Time Use Survey (ATUS) for years 2003-2016. The ATUS is an
		annual survey conducted on a sample of individuals across the
		United States studying how individuals spent their time over
		the course of a day. Individual respondents were interviewed
		about what activities they did, during what times (rounded to
		15 minute increments), at what locations, and in the presence
		of which individuals. The activities are subsequently encoded
		based on 3 separate tier codes for classification. This package
		includes data from the multi-year ATUS Activities, ATUS-CPS,
		and ATUS Respondents files were included. Columns were selected
		based on completeness of data as well as presence on the
		Frequently Used Variables list provided by the ATUS website.
		All activity codes (other than code '50' for 'Unable to Code')
		were included. Permission was obtained from the Bureau of Labor
		Statistics for inclusion in this package. The full data can be
		obtained from http://www.bls.gov/tus/.
