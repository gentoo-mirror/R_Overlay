		Estimate a Log-Concave Probability Density from iid Observations
		// Given independent and identically distributed observations
		X(1), ..., X(n), compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
		of a density as well as a smoothed version of it under the
		assumption that the density is log-concave, see Rufibach (2007)
		and Duembgen and Rufibach (2009). The main function of the
		package is 'logConDens' that allows computation of the log-
		concave MLE and its smoothed version. In addition, we provide
		functions to compute (1) the value of the density and
		distribution function estimates (MLE and smoothed) at a given
		point (2) the characterizing functions of the estimator, (3) to
		sample from the estimated distribution, (5) to compute a two-
		sample permutation test based on log-concave densities, (6) the
		ROC curve based on log-concave estimates within cases and
		controls, including confidence intervals for given values of
		false positive fractions (7) computation of a confidence
		interval for the value of the true density at a fixed point.
		Finally, three datasets that have been used to illustrate log-
		concave density estimation are made available.
