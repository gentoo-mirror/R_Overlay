		Bayesian Inference from the Conditional Genetic Stock
		Identification Model // Implements Bayesian inference for the
		conditional genetic stock identification model.  It allows
		inference of mixed fisheries and also simulation of mixtures to
		predict accuracy.  A full description of the underlying methods
		is available in a recently published article in the Canadian
		Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences:
		doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0016.
