		Bayesian Inference from the Conditional Genetic Stock
		Identification Model // Implements Bayesian inference for the
		conditional genetic stock identification model.  It allows
		inference of mixed fisheries and also simulation of mixtures to
		predict accuracy.  A full description of the underlying methods
		is in review at Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic
