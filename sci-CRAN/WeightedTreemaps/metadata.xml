		Generate and Plot Voronoi or Sunburst Treemaps from Hierarchical
		Data // Treemaps are a visually appealing graphical
		representation of numerical data using a space-filling
		approach. A plane or 'map' is subdivided into smaller areas
		called cells.  The cells in the map are scaled according to an
		underlying metric which allows to grasp the hierarchical
		organization and relative importance of many objects at once.
		This package contains two different implementations of
		treemaps, Voronoi treemaps and Sunburst treemaps.  The Voronoi
		treemap function subdivides the plot area in polygonal cells
		according to the highest hierarchical level, then continues to
		subdivide those parental cells on the next lower hierarchical
		level, and so on. The Sunburst treemap is a computationally
		less demanding treemap that does not require iterative
		refinement, but simply generates circle sectors that are sized
		according to predefined weights.  The Voronoi tesselation is
		based on functions from Paul Murrell (2012) https://www.stat.au
		ckland.ac.nz/~paul/Reports/VoronoiTreemap/voronoiTreeMap.html.
