		Model Diagnostics for Accelerated Failure Time Models // A
		collection of model checking methods for semiparametric
		accelerated failure time (AFT) models under the rank-based
		approach. For the (computational) efficiency, Gehan's weight is
		used. It provides functions to verify whether the observed data
		fit the specific model assumptions such as a functional form of
		each covariate, a link function, and an omnibus test. The
		p-value offered in this package is based on the Kolmogorov-type
		supremum test and the variance of the proposed test statistics
		is estimated through the re-sampling method. Furthermore, a
		graphical technique to compare the shape of the observed
		residual to a number of the approximated realizations is
		provided.
