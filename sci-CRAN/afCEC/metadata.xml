		Active Function Cross-Entropy Clustering // Active function
		cross-entropy clustering partitions the n-dimensional data into
		the clusters by finding the parameters of the mixed generalized
		multivariate normal distribution, that optimally approximates
		the scattering of the data in the n-dimensional space, whose
		density function is of the form: p_1*N(mi_1,^sigma_1,sigma_1,f_
		1)+...+p_k*N(mi_k,^sigma_k,sigma_k,f_k). The above-mentioned
		generalization is performed by introducing so called "f-adapted
		Gaussian densities" (i.e. the ordinary Gaussian densities
		adapted by the "active function"). Additionally, the active
		function cross-entropy clustering performs the automatic
		reduction of the unnecessary clusters. For more information
		please refer to P. Spurek, J. Tabor, K.Byrski, "Active function
		Cross-Entropy Clustering" (2017)
