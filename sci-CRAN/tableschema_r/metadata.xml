		Frictionless Data Table Schema // Allows to work with 'Table
		Schema' (http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/).
		'Table Schema' is well suited for use cases around handling and
		validating tabular data in text formats such as 'csv', but its
		utility extends well beyond this core usage, towards a range of
		applications where data benefits from a portable schema format.
		The 'tableschema.r' package can load and validate any table
		schema descriptor, allow the creation and modification of
		descriptors, expose methods for reading and streaming data that
		conforms to a 'Table Schema' via the 'Tabular Data Resource'
		abstraction.
