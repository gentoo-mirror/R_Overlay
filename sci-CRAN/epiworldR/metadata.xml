		Fast Agent-Based Epi Models // A flexible framework for Agent-
		Based Models (ABM), the 'epiworldR' package provides methods
		for prototyping disease outbreaks and transmission models using
		a 'C++' backend, making it very fast. It supports multiple
		epidemiological models, including the Susceptible-Infected-
		Susceptible (SIS), Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR),
		Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR), and others,
		involving arbitrary mitigation policies and multiple-disease
		models. Users can specify infectiousness/susceptibility rates
		as a function of agents' features, providing great complexity
		for the model dynamics. Furthermore, 'epiworldR' is ideal for
		simulation studies featuring large populations.
