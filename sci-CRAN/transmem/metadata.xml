		Treatment of Membrane-Transport Data // Treatment and
		visualization of membrane (selective) transport data. Transport
		profiles involving up to three species are produced as
		publication-ready plots and several membrane performance
		parameters (e.g. separation factors as defined in Koros et al.
		(1996) doi:10.1351/pac199668071479 and non-linear regression
		parameters for the equations described in Rodriguez de San
		Miguel et al. (2014) doi:10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.03.052) can be
		obtained. Many widely used experimental setups (e.g. membrane
		physical aging) can be easily studied through the package's
		graphical representations.
