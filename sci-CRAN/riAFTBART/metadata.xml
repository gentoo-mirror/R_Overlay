		A Flexible Approach for Causal Inference with Multiple Treatments
		and Clustered Survival Outcomes // Random-intercept accelerated
		failure time (AFT) model utilizing Bayesian additive regression
		trees (BART) for drawing causal inferences about multiple
		treatments while accounting for the multilevel survival data
		structure. It also includes an interpretable sensitivity
		analysis approach to evaluate how the drawn causal conclusions
		might be altered in response to the potential magnitude of
		departure from the no unmeasured confounding assumption.This
		package implements the methods described by Hu et al. (2022)
