		Scalable Joint Species Distribution Modeling // A scalable and
		fast method for estimating joint Species Distribution Models
		(jSDMs) for big community data, including eDNA data. The
		package estimates a full (i.e. non-latent) jSDM with different
		response distributions (including the traditional multivariate
		probit model). The package allows to perform variation
		partitioning (VP) / ANOVA on the fitted models to separate the
		contribution of environmental, spatial, and biotic
		associations. In addition, the total R-squared can be further
		partitioned per species and site to reveal the internal
		metacommunity structure, see Leibold et al.,
		doi:10.1111/oik.08618. The internal structure can then be
		regressed against environmental and spatial distinctiveness,
		richness, and traits to analyze metacommunity assembly
		processes.  The package includes support for accounting for
		spatial autocorrelation and the option to fit responses using
		deep neural networks instead of a standard linear predictor. As
		described in Pichler  Hartig (2021)
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13687, scalability is achieved by using a
		Monte Carlo approximation of the joint likelihood implemented
		via 'PyTorch' and 'reticulate', which can be run on CPUs or
		GPUs.
