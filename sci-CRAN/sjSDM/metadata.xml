		Scalable Joint Species Distribution Modeling // A scalable method
		to estimate joint Species Distribution Models (jSDMs) for big
		community datasets based on a Monte Carlo approximation of the
		joint likelihood.  The numerical approximation is based on
		'PyTorch' and 'reticulate', and can be run on CPUs and GPUs
		alike. The method is described in Pichler  Hartig (2021)
		doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13687. The package contains various
		extensions, including support for different response families,
		ability to account for spatial autocorrelation, and deep neural
		networks instead of the linear predictor in jSDMs.
