		Classic, Nonparametric and Bayesian One-Way Analysis of Variance
		Panel // It covers various approaches to analysis of variance,
		provides an assumption testing section in order to provide a
		decision diagram that allows selecting the most appropriate
		technique. It provides the classical analysis of variance, the
		nonparametric equivalent of Kruskal Wallis, and the Bayesian
		approach. These results are shown in an interactive shiny
		panel, which allows modifying the arguments of the tests,
		contains interactive graphics and presents automatic
		conclusions depending on the tests in order to contribute to
		the interpretation of these analyzes. 'AovBay' uses 'Stan' and
		'FactorBayes' for Bayesian analysis and 'Highcharts' for
		interactive charts.
