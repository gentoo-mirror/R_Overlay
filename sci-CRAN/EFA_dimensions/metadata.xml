		Exploratory Factor Analysis Functions for Assessing
		Dimensionality // Functions for eleven procedures for
		determining the number of factors, including functions for
		parallel analysis and the minimum average partial test. There
		are also functions for conducting principal components
		analysis, principal axis factor analysis, maximum likelihood
		factor analysis, image factor analysis, and extension factor
		analysis, all of which can take raw data or correlation
		matrices as input and with options for conducting the analyses
		using Pearson correlations, Kendall correlations, Spearman
		correlations, gamma correlations, or polychoric correlations.
		Varimax rotation, promax rotation, and Procrustes rotations can
		be performed. Additional functions focus on the factorability
		of a correlation matrix, the congruences between factors from
		different datasets, the assessment of local independence, the
		assessment of factor solution complexity, and internal
		consistency. Auerswald  Moshagen (2019, ISSN:1939-1463);
