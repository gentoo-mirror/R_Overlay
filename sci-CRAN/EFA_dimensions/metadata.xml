		Exploratory Factor Analysis Functions for Assessing
		Dimensionality // Functions for seven different procedures for
		determining the number of factors, including functions for
		parallel analysis and the minimum average partial test. There
		are functions for conducting principal components analysis,
		principal axis factor analysis, maximum likelihood factor
		analysis, image factor analysis, and extension factor analysis,
		all of which can take raw data or correlation matrices as input
		and with options for conducting the analyses using Pearson
		correlations, Kendall correlations, Spearman correlations, or
		polychoric correlations. Varimax rotation, promax rotation, and
		Procrustes rotations can be performed. Additional functions
		focus on the factorability of a correlation matrix, the
		congruences between factors from different datasets, and for
		assessing local independence. O'Connor (2000,
