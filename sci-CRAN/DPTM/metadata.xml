		Dynamic Panel Multiple Threshold Model with Fixed Effects //
		Compute the fixed effects dynamic panel threshold model
		suggested by Ramrez-Rondn (2020)
		doi:10.1080/07474938.2019.1624401, and dynamic panel linear
		model suggested by Hsiao et al. (2002)
		doi:10.1016/S0304-4076(01)00143-9, where maximum likelihood
		type estimators are used. Multiple thresholds estimation based
		on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is allowed, and model
		selection of linear model, threshold model and multiple
		threshold model is also allowed.
