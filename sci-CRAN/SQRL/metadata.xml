		Enhances Interaction with 'ODBC' Databases // Provides simple and
		powerful interfaces that facilitate interaction with 'ODBC'
		data sources. Each data source gets its own unique and
		dedicated interface, wrapped around 'RODBC'. Communication
		settings are remembered between queries, and are managed
		silently in the background. The interfaces support multi-
		statement 'SQL' scripts, which can be parameterised via
		metaprogramming structures and embedded 'R' expressions.
