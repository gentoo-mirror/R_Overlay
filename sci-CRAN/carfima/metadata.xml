		Continuous-Time Fractionally Integrated ARMA Process for
		Irregularly Spaced Long-Memory Time Series Data // We provide a
		toolbox to fit a continuous-time fractionally integrated ARMA
		process (CARFIMA) on univariate and irregularly spaced time
		series data via both frequentist and Bayesian machinery. A
		general-order CARFIMA(p, H, q) model for pq is specified in
		Tsai and Chan (2005) doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00522.x and
		it involves p+q+2 unknown model parameters, i.e., p AR
		parameters, q MA parameters, Hurst parameter H, and process
		uncertainty (standard deviation) sigma. Also, the model can
		account for heteroscedastic measurement errors, if the
		information about measurement error standard deviations is
		known. The package produces their maximum likelihood estimates
		and asymptotic uncertainties using a global optimizer called
		the differential evolution algorithm. It also produces
		posterior samples of the model parameters via Metropolis-
		Hastings within a Gibbs sampler equipped with adaptive Markov
		chain Monte Carlo. These fitting procedures, however, may
		produce numerical errors if p2. The toolbox also contains a
		function to simulate discrete time series data from CARFIMA(p,
		H, q) process given the model parameters and observation times.
