		Continuous-Time Fractionally Integrated ARMA Process for
		Irregularly Spaced Long-Memory Time Series Data // We provide a
		toolbox to fit a continuous-time fractionally integrated ARMA
		process (CARFIMA) on univariate and irregularly spaced time
		series data via frequentist or Bayesian machinery. A general-
		order CARFIMA(p, H, q) model for pq is specified in Tsai and
		Chan (2005) doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00522.x and it
		involves (p+q+2) unknown model parameters, i.e., p AR
		parameters, q MA parameters, Hurst parameter H, and process
		uncertainty (standard deviation) sigma. The package produces
		their maximum likelihood estimates and asymptotic uncertainties
		using a global optimizer called the differential evolution
		algorithm. It also produces their posterior distributions via
		Metropolis within a Gibbs sampler equipped with adaptive Markov
		chain Monte Carlo for posterior sampling. These fitting
		procedures, however, may produce numerical errors if p2. The
		toolbox also contains a function to simulate discrete time
		series data from CARFIMA(p, H, q) process given the model
		parameters and observation times.
