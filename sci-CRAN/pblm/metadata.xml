		Bivariate Additive Marginal Regression for Categorical Responses
		// Bivariate additive categorical regression via penalized
		maximum likelihood. Under a multinomial framework, the method
		fits bivariate models where both responses are nominal,
		ordinal, or a mix of the two. Partial proportional odds models
		are supported, with flexible (non-)uniform association
		structures. Various logit types and parametrizations can be
		specified for both marginals and the association, including
		Dales model. The association structure can be regularized using
		polynomial-type penalty terms. Additive effects are modeled
		using P-splines. Standard methods such as summary(),
		residuals(), and predict() are available.
