		Estimation in Dual Frame Surveys // Point and interval estimation
		in dual frame surveys. In contrast to classic sampling theory,
		where only one sampling frame is considered, dual frame
		methodology assumes that there are two frames available for
		sampling and that, overall, they cover the entire target
		population. Then, two probability samples (one from each frame)
		are drawn and information collected is suitably combined to get
		estimators of the parameter of interest.
