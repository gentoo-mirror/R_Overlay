		Statistical Methods for Psychologists // Implements confidence
		interval and sample size methods that are especially useful in
		psychological research. The methods can be applied in 1-group,
		2-group, paired-samples, and multiple-group designs and to a
		variety of parameters including means, medians, proportions,
		slopes, standardized mean differences, standardized linear
		contrasts of means, plus several measures of correlation and
		association. The confidence intervals and sample size functions
		are applicable to single parameters as well as differences,
		ratios, and linear contrasts of parameters.  The sample size
		functions can be used to approximate the sample size needed to
		estimate a parameter or function of parameters with desired
		confidence interval precision or to perform a variety of
		hypothesis tests (directional two-sided, equivalence,
		superiority, noninferiority) with desired power. For details,
		see: https://csass.ucsc.edu/self-
		study%20courses/statistical_methods.html.
