		Kernel for 'Jupyter' // Provides a full implementation of the
		'Jupyter' http://jupyter.org/ messaging protocol in C++ by
		leveraging 'Rcpp' and 'Xeus'
		https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus. 'Jupyter' supplies an
		interactive computing environment and a messaging protocol
		defined over 'ZeroMQ' for multiple programming languages. This
		package implements the 'Jupyter' kernel interface so that 'R'
		is exposed to this interactive computing environment. 'ZeroMQ'
		functionality is provided by the 'pbdZMQ' package. 'Xeus' is a
		C++ library that facilitates the implementation of kernels for
		'Jupyter'. Additionally, 'Xeus' provides an interface to
		libraries that exist in the 'Jupyter' ecosystem for building
		widgets, plotting, and more https://blog.jupyter.org
		/interactive-workflows-for-c-with-jupyter-fe9b54227d92.
		'JuniperKernel' uses 'Xeus' as a library for the 'Jupyter'
		messaging protocol.
