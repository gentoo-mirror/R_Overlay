		Easy Interface to Effective Concentration Calculations // Because
		fungicide resistance is an important phenotypic trait for fungi
		and oomycetes, it is necessary to have a standardized method of
		statistically analyzing the Effective Concentration (EC)
		values. This package is designed for those who are not terribly
		familiar with R to be able to analyze and plot an entire set of
		isolates using the 'drc' package.
