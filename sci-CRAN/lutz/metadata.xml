		Look Up Time Zones of Point Coordinates // Input latitude and
		longitude values or an 'sf/sfc' POINT object and get back the
		time zone in which they exist. Two methods are implemented. One
		is very fast and uses 'Rcpp' in conjunction with data from the
		'Javascript' library (https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup-
		oss/). This method also works outside of countries' borders and
		in international waters, however speed comes at the cost of
		accuracy - near time zone borders away from populated centres
		there is a chance that it will return the incorrect time zone.
		The other method is slower but more accurate - it uses the 'sf'
		package to intersect points with a detailed map of time zones
		from here: https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-
		builder/. The package also contains several utility functions
		for helping to understand and visualize time zones, such as
		listing of world time zones, including information about
		daylight savings times and their offsets from UTC. You can also
		plot a time zone to visualize the UTC offset over a year and
		when daylight savings times are in effect.
