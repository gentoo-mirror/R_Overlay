		Joint Latent Class Trees for Joint Modeling of Time-to-Event and
		Longitudinal Data // Implements the tree-based approach to
		joint modeling of time-to-event and longitudinal data. This
		approach looks for a tree-based partitioning such that within
		each estimated latent class defined by a terminal node, the
		time-to-event and longitudinal responses display a lack of
		association. See Zhang and Simonoff (2018) arXiv:1812.01774.
