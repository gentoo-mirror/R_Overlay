		'cry' and 'rgl'  Applications in Crystallography // Visualizing
		crystal structures and selected area electron diffraction
		(SAED) patterns.  It provides functions cry_demo() and
		dp_demo() to load a file in 'CIF' (Crystallographic Information
		Framework) formats and display crystal structures and electron
		diffraction patterns.  The function dp_demo() also performs
		simple simulation of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns,
		and the results can be saved to a file in the working
		directory.  The package has been tested on several platforms,
		including Linux on 'Crostini' with a Core m3-8100Y Chromebook,
		I found that even on this low-powered platform, the performance
		was acceptable. T. Hanashima (2001)
