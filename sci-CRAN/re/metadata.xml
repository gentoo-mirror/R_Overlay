		'Python' Style Regular Expression Functions // A comprehensive
		set of regular expression functions based on those found in
		'Python' without relying on 'reticulate'. It provides functions
		that intend to (1) make it easier for users familiar with
		'Python' to work with regular expressions, (2) reduce the
		complexity often associated with regular expressions code, (3)
		and enable users to write more readable and maintainable code
		that relies on regular expression-based pattern matching.
