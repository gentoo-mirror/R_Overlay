		Origin Estimation for Propagation Processes on Complex Networks
		// Performs network-based source estimation. Different
		approaches are available: effective distance median, recursive
		backtracking, and centrality-based source estimation.
		Additionally, we provide public transportation network data as
		well as methods for data preparation, source estimation
		performance analysis and visualization.
