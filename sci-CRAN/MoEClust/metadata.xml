		Gaussian Parsimonious Clustering Models with Covariates and a
		Noise Component // Clustering via parsimonious Gaussian
		Mixtures of Experts using the MoEClust models introduced by
		Murphy and Murphy (2018) arXiv:1711.05632. This package fits
		finite Gaussian mixture models with a formula interface for
		supplying gating and/or expert network covariates using a range
		of parsimonious covariance parameterisations from the GPCM
		family via the EM/CEM algorithm. Visualisation of the results
		of such models using generalised pairs plots and the inclusion
		of an additional noise component is also facilitated.
