		Parsimonious Model-Based Clustering with Covariates // Clustering
		via parsimonious Mixtures of Experts using the MoEClust models
		introduced by Murphy and Murphy (2017) arXiv:1711.05632. This
		package fits finite Gaussian mixture models with gating and
		expert network covariates using parsimonious covariance
		parameterisations from 'mclust' via the EM algorithm.
		Visualisation of the results of such models using generalised
		pairs plots is also facilitated.
