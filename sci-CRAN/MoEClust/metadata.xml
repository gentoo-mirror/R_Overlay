		Gaussian Parsimonious Clustering Models with Covariates //
		Clustering via parsimonious Gaussian Mixtures of Experts using
		the MoEClust models introduced by Murphy and Murphy (2017)
		arXiv:1711.05632. This package fits finite Gaussian mixture
		models with a formula interface for supplying gating and/or
		expert network covariates using a range of parsimonious
		covariance parameterisations via the EM/CEM algorithm.
		Visualisation of the results of such models using generalised
		pairs plots is also facilitated.
