		Gaussian Parsimonious Clustering Models with Covariates and a
		Noise Component // Clustering via parsimonious Gaussian
		Mixtures of Experts using the MoEClust models introduced by
		Murphy and Murphy (2020) doi:10.1007/s11634-019-00373-8. This
		package fits finite Gaussian mixture models with a formula
		interface for supplying gating and/or expert network covariates
		using a range of parsimonious covariance parameterisations from
		the GPCM family via the EM/CEM algorithm. Visualisation of the
		results of such models using generalised pairs plots and the
		inclusion of an additional noise component is also facilitated.
		A greedy forward stepwise search algorithm is provided for
		identifying the optimal model in terms of the number of
		components, the GPCM covariance parameterisation, and the
		subsets of gating/expert network covariates.
