		Clonality Estimates in Tumor // Analyze data from next-generation
		sequencing experiments on genomic samples. 'CLONETv2' offers a
		set of functions to compute allele specific copy number and
		clonality from segmented data and SNPs position pileup. The
		package has also calculated the clonality of single nucleotide
		variants given read counts at mutated positions. The package
		has been developed at the laboratory of Computational and
		Functional Oncology, Department of CIBIO, University of Trento
		(Italy), under the supervision of prof Francesca Demichelis.
