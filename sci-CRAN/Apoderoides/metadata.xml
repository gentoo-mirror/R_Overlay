		Prioritize and Delete Erroneous Taxa in a Large Phylogenetic Tree
		// Finds, prioritizes and deletes erroneous taxa in a
		phylogenetic tree. This package calculates scores for taxa in a
		tree. Higher score means the taxon is more erroneous. If the
		score is zero for a taxon, the taxon is not erroneous. This
		package also can remove all erroneous taxa automatically by
		iterating score calculation and pruning taxa with the highest
		score.
