		Reinforcement Learning Tools for Two-Alternative Forced Choice
		Tasks // Tools for building Rescorla-Wagner Models for Two-
		Alternative Forced Choice tasks, commonly employed in
		psychological research. Most concepts and ideas within this R
		package are referenced from Sutton and Barto (2018)
		ISBN:9780262039246. The package allows for the intuitive
		definition of RL models using simple if-else statements and
		three basic models built into this R package are referenced
		from Niv et al. (2012)doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5498-10.2012. Our
		approach to constructing and evaluating these computational
		models is informed by the guidelines proposed in Wilson
		Collins (2019) doi:10.7554/eLife.49547. Example datasets
		included with the package are sourced from the work of Mason et
		al. (2024) doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02415-x.
