		Reinforcement Learning Tools for Two-Alternative Forced Choice
		Tasks // Tools for building reinforcement learning (RL) models
		specifically tailored for Two-Alternative Forced Choice (TAFC)
		tasks, commonly employed in psychological research. These
		models build upon the foundational principles of model-free
		reinforcement learning detailed in Sutton and Barto (2018)
		ISBN:9780262039246. The package allows for the intuitive
		definition of RL models using simple if-else statements. Our
		approach to constructing and evaluating these computational
		models is informed by the guidelines proposed in Wilson
		Collins (2019) doi:10.7554/eLife.49547. Example datasets
		included with the package are sourced from the work of Mason et
		al. (2024) doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02415-x.
