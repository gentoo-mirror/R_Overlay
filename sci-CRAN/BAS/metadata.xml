		Bayesian Variable Selection and Model Averaging using Bayesian
		Adaptive Sampling // Package for Bayesian Variable Selection
		and  Model Averaging in linear models and generalized linear
		models using stochastic or deterministic sampling without
		replacement from posterior distributions.  Prior distributions
		on coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of
		g-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the
		mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008)
		DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337 for linear models or mixtures of
		g-priors in GLMs of Li and Clyde (2015) arXiv:1503.06913. Other
		model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes
		estimates of g. Sampling probabilities may be updated based on
		the sampled models using Sampling w/out Replacement or an
		efficient MCMC algorithm samples models using the BAS tree
		structure as an efficient hash table. Uniform priors over all
		models or beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are
		allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model space
		may be used.  The user may force variables to always be
		included. Details behind the sampling algorithm are provided in
		Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010)   DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049.
