		Bayesian Variable Selection and Model Averaging using Bayesian
		Adaptive Sampling // Package for Bayesian Variable Selection
		and  Model Averaging in linear models and generalized linear
		models using stochastic or deterministic sampling without
		replacement from posterior distributions.  Prior distributions
		on coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of
		g-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the
		mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008)
		DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337 for linear models or mixtures of
		g-priors from  Li and Clyde (2019)
		DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1469992 in generalized linear models.
		Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical
		Bayes estimates of g. Sampling probabilities may be updated
		based on the sampled models using sampling w/out replacement or
		an efficient MCMC algorithm which samples models using a tree
		structure of the model space as an efficient hash table.  See
		Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049 for
		details on the sampling algorithms. Uniform priors over all
		models or beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are
		allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model space
		may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank. The
		user may force variables to always be included in addition to
		imposing constraints that higher order interactions are
		included only if their parents are included in the model. This
		material is based upon work supported by the National Science
		Foundation under Division of Mathematical Sciences grant
		1106891. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or
		recommendations expressed in this material are those of the
