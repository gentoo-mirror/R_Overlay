		Identifying Modulators of Cellular Responses Leveraging
		Intercellular Heterogeneity // Cellular responses to
		perturbations are highly heterogeneous and depend largely on
		the initial state of cells. Connecting post-perturbation cells
		via cellular trajectories to untreated cells (e.g. by
		leveraging metabolic labeling information) enables exploitation
		of intercellular heterogeneity as a combined knock-down and
		overexpression screen to identify pathway modulators, termed
		Heterogeneity-seq (see 'Berg et al'
		doi:10.1101/2024.10.28.620481). This package contains functions
		to generate cellular trajectories based on scSLAM-seq (single-
		cell, thiol-(SH)-linked alkylation of RNA for metabolic
		labelling sequencing) time courses, functions to identify
		pathway modulators and to visualize the results.
