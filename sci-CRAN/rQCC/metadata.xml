		Robust Quality Control Chart // Constructs various robust quality
		control charts based on the median or Hodges-Lehmann estimator
		(location) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) or Shamos
		estimator (scale). The estimators used for the robust control
		charts are all unbiased with a sample of finite size. For more
		details, see Park, Kim and Wang (2022)
		doi:10.1080/03610918.2019.1699114. In addition, using this R
		package, the conventional quality control charts such as X-bar,
		S, R, p, np, u, c, g, h, and t charts are also easily
		constructed. This work was supported by the National Research
		Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government
		(MSIT) (No. 2022R1A2C1091319).
