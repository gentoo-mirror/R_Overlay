		Robust Quality Control Chart // Constructs robust quality control
		chart based on the median or Hodges-Lehmann estimator
		(location) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) or Shamos
		estimator (scale). These estimators are all unbiased with a
		sample of finite size. For more details, see Park, Kim and Wang
		(2020) doi:10.1080/03610918.2019.1699114. In addition, using
		this package, the conventional quality control charts such as
		X-bar, S and R charts are also easily constructed. This work
		was partially supported by the National Research Foundation of
		Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government
		(NRF-2017R1A2B4004169).
