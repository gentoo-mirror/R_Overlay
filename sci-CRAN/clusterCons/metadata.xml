		Consensus Clustering using Multiple Algorithms and Parameters //
		Functions for calculation of robustness measures for clusters
		and cluster membership based on generating consensus matrices
		from bootstrapped clustering experiments in which a random
		proportion of rows of the data set are used in each individual
		clustering. This allows the user to prioritise clusters and the
		members of clusters based on their consistency in this regime.
		The functions allow the user to select several algorithms to
		use in the re-sampling scheme and with any of the parameters
		that the algorithm would normally take. See Simpson, T. I.,
