		Model Disability Survey (MDS)
		https://www.who.int/disabilities/data/en/ is a World Health
		Organization (WHO) general population survey instrument to
		assess the distribution of disability within a country or
		region, grounded in the International Classification of
		Functioning, Disability and Health
		https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-
		classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health. This
		package provides fit-for-purpose functions for calculating and
		presenting the results from this survey, as used by the WHO.

		Analysis (see Andrich (2011) doi:10.1586/erp.11.59) to
