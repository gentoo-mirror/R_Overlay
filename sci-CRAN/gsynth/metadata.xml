		Generalized Synthetic Control Method // Provides causal inference
		with interactive fixed-effect models. It imputes
		counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group
		information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model
		that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with
		time-varying coefficients. This method generalizes the
		synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units
		and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and
		interpretability. This version supports unbalanced panels.
