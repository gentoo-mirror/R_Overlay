		Generalized Synthetic Control Method // Generalized synthetic
		control method: causal inference with interactive fixed-effect
		models. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using
		control group information based on a linear interactive fixed
		effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts
		interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method
		generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of
		multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and
		improves efficiency and interpretability. Data must be with a
		dichotomous treatment but not necessarily in form of a balanced
		panel data.
