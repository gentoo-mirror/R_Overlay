		A Toolkit for Recursive Partytioning // A toolkit with
		infrastructure for representing, summarizing, and visualizing
		tree-structured regression and classification models. This
		unified infrastructure can be used for reading/coercing tree
		models from different sources ('rpart', 'RWeka', 'PMML')
		yielding objects that share functionality for
		print()/plot()/predict() methods. Furthermore, new and improved
		reimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and
		model-based recursive partitioning (mob()) from the 'party'
		package are provided based on the new infrastructure. A
		description of this package was published by Hothorn and
		Zeileis (2015) http://jmlr.org/papers/v16/hothorn15a.html.
