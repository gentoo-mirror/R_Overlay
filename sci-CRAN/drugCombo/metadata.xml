		Drug Interaction Modeling Based on Loewe Additivity Following
		Harbron's Approach // Perform assessment of synergy/antagonism
		for drug combinations based on the Loewe additivity model,
		following Harbron's approach (Statistics in Medicine, 2010,
		doi:10.1002/sim.3916). The package allows flexible modeling of
		the drug interaction index and supports "2-stage" estimation in
		addition to "1-stage" estimation, including bootstrap-based
		confidence intervals. The method requires data on the
		monotherapy responses and the package accommodates both
		checkerboard and ray designs. Functions are available for
		graphical exploration of model goodness-of-fit and diagnostics,
		as well as for synergy/antagonism assessment in 2D and 3D.
