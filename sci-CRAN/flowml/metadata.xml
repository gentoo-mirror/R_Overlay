		A Backend for a 'nextflow' Pipeline that Performs Machine-
		Learning-Based Modeling of Biomedical Data // Provides
		functionality to perform machine-learning-based modeling in a
		computation pipeline. Its functions contain the basic steps of
		machine-learning-based knowledge discovery workflows, including
		model training and optimization, model evaluation, and model
		testing. To perform these tasks, the package builds heavily on
		existing machine-learning packages, such as 'caret'
		https://github.com/topepo/caret/ and associated packages. The
		package can train multiple models, optimize model
		hyperparameters by performing a grid search or a random search,
		and evaluates model performance by different metrics. Models
		can be validated either on a test data set, or in case of a
		small sample size by k-fold cross validation or repeated
		bootstrapping. It also allows for 0-Hypotheses generation by
		performing permutation experiments. Additionally, it offers
		methods of model interpretation and item categorization to
		identify the most informative features from a high dimensional
		data space. The functions of this package can easily be
		integrated into computation pipelines (e.g. 'nextflow'
		https://www.nextflow.io/) and hereby improve scalability,
		standardization, and re-producibility in the context of
		machine-learning.
