		Computes and Plot the Optimal Charging Strategy for Electric
		Vehicles // The purpose of this library is to compute the
		optimal charging cost function for a electric vehicle (EV). It
		is well known that the charging function of a EV is a concave
		function that can be approximated by a piece-wise linear
		function, so bigger the state of charge, slower the charging
		process is. Moreover, the other important function is the one
		that gives the electricity price. This function is usually
		step-wise, since depending on the time of the day, the price of
		the electricity is different. Then, the problem of charging an
		EV to a certain state of charge is not trivial. This library
		implements an algorithm to compute the optimal charging cost
		function, that is, it plots for a given state of charge r
		(between 0 and 1) the minimum cost we need to pay in order to
		charge the EV to that state of charge r. The details of the
		algorithm are described in Gonzlez-Rodrguez et at (2023)
