		Cross Validation Based on Survey Design // Functions to generate
		K-fold cross validation (CV) folds and CV test error estimates
		that take into account how a survey dataset's sampling design
		was constructed (SRS, clustering, stratification, and/or
		unequal sampling weights). You can input linear and logistic
		regression models, along with data and a type of survey design
		in order to get an output that can help you determine which
		model best fits the data using K-fold cross validation. Our
		paper on "K-Fold Cross-Validation for Complex Sample Surveys"
		by Wieczorek, Guerin, and McMahon (2022) doi:10.1002/sta4.454
		explains why differing how we take folds based on survey design
		is useful.
