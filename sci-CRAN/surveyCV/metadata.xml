		Cross Validation Based on Survey Design // Functions to generate
		test error estimates using cross validation, based on how a
		survey design is constructed (SRS, clustering, stratification,
		and/or unequal sampling weights). You can input linear and
		logistic regression models, along with data and a type of
		survey design in order to get an output that can help you
		determine which model best fits the data using K-fold cross
		validation. Our draft paper on "K-Fold Cross-Validation for
		Complex Sample Surveys" (under review; a copy is in the 'data-
		raw' folder of our GitHub repo) explains why differing how we
		take folds based on survey design is useful.
