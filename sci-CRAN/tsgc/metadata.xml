		Time Series Methods Based on Growth Curves // The 'tsgc' package
		provides comprehensive tools for the analysis and forecasting
		of epidemic trajectories. It is designed to model the
		progression of an epidemic over time while accounting for the
		various uncertainties inherent in real-time data. Underpinned
		by a dynamic Gompertz model, the package adopts a state space
		approach, using the Kalman filter for flexible and robust
		estimation of the non-linear growth pattern commonly observed
		in epidemic data. The reinitialization feature enhances the
		models ability to adapt to the emergence of new waves. The
		forecasts generated by the package are of value to public
		health officials and researchers who need to understand and
		predict the course of an epidemic to inform decision-making.
		Beyond its application in public health, the package is also a
		useful resource for researchers and practitioners in fields
		where the trajectories of interest resemble those of epidemics,
		such as innovation diffusion. The package includes
		functionalities for data preprocessing, model fitting, and
		forecast visualization, as well as tools for evaluating
		forecast accuracy. The core methodologies implemented in 'tsgc'
		are based on well-established statistical techniques as
		described in Harvey and Kattuman (2020)
