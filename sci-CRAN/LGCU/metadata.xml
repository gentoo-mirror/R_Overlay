		Implementation of Learning Gamma CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) Control
		Charts // Implements Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control charts
		specifically designed for monitoring processes following a
		Gamma distribution. Provides functions to estimate distribution
		parameters, simulate control limits, and apply cautious
		learning schemes for adaptive thresholding. It supports upward
		and downward monitoring with guaranteed performance evaluated
		via Monte Carlo simulations. It is useful for quality control
		applications in industries where data follows a Gamma
		distribution. Methods are based on Madrid-Alvarez et al. (2024)
		doi:10.1002/qre.3464 and Madrid-Alvarez et al. (2024)
