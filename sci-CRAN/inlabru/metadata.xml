		Bayesian Latent Gaussian Modelling using INLA and Extensions //
		Facilitates spatial and general latent Gaussian modeling using
		integrated nested Laplace approximation via the INLA package
		(https://www.r-inla.org). Additionally, extends the GAM-like
		model class to more general nonlinear predictor expressions,
		and implements a log Gaussian Cox process likelihood for
		modeling univariate and spatial point processes based on
		ecological survey data. Model components are specified with
		general inputs and mapping methods to the latent variables, and
		the predictors are specified via general R expressions, with
		separate expressions for each observation likelihood model in
		multi-likelihood models. A prediction method based on fast
		Monte Carlo sampling allows posterior prediction of general
		expressions of the latent variables. Ecology-focused
