		Prompt Large Language Models and Enhance Their Functionality //
		Easily construct prompts and associated logic for interacting
		with large language models (LLMs). 'tidyprompt' introduces the
		concept of prompt wraps, which are building blocks that you can
		use to quickly turn a simple prompt into a complex one. Prompt
		wraps do not just modify the prompt text, but also add
		extraction and validation functions that will be applied to the
		response of the LLM. This ensures that the user gets the
		desired output. 'tidyprompt' can add various features to
		prompts and their evaluation by LLMs, such as structured
		output, automatic feedback, retries, reasoning modes,
		autonomous R function calling, and R code generation and
		evaluation. It is designed to be compatible with any LLM
		provider that offers chat completion.
