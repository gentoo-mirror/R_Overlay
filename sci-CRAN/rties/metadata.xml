		Modeling Interpersonal Dynamics // The name of this package grew
		out of our research on temporal interpersonal emotion systems
		(TIES), hence 'rties'. It provides tools for using a set of
		models to investigate temporal processes in bivariate (e.g.,
		dyadic) systems. The general approach is to model, one dyad at
		a time, the dynamics of a variable that is assessed repeatedly
		from both partners, extract the parameter estimates for each
		dyad, and then use those parameter estimates as input to a
		latent profile analysis to extract groups of dyads with
		qualitatively distinct dynamics. Finally, the profile
		memberships can be used to either predict, or be predicted by,
		another variable of interest. Currently, 2 models are
		supported: 1) inertia-coordination, and 2) a coupled-
		oscillator. Extended documentation is provided in vignettes.
		Theoretical background can be found in Butler (2011)
