		Asymmetry Measures for Probability Density Functions // Provides
		functions and examples for the weak and strong density
		asymmetry measures in the articles: "A measure of asymmetry",
		Patil, Patil and Bagkavos (2012) doi:10.1007/s00362-011-0401-6
		and "A measure of asymmetry based on a new necessary and
		sufficient condition for symmetry", Patil, Bagkavos and Wood
		(2014) doi:10.1007/s13171-013-0034-z. The measures provided
		here are useful for quantifying the asymmetry of the shape of a
		density of a random variable. The package facilitates
		implementation of the measures which are applicable in a
		variety of fields including e.g. probability theory, statistics
		and economics.
