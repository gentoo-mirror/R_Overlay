		Tools for Plotting Skew-T Diagrams and Wind Profiles // A
		collection of programs for plotting SKEW-T,log p diagrams and
		wind profiles for data collected by radiosondes (the typical
		weather balloon-borne instrument). The format of this plot with
		companion lines to assess atmospheric stability are both
		standard  in meteorology and difficult to create from basic
		graphics functions. Hence this package. One novel feature is
		being able add several profiles to the same plot for
		comparison. Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for an explanation of the
		variables needed and how they should be named in a data frame.
		See https://github.com/dnychka/Radiosonde for the package home
		page.
