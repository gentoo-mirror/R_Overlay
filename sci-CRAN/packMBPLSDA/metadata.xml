		Multi-Block Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis //
		Several functions are provided to implement a MBPLSDA :
		components search, optimal model components number search,
		optimal model validity test by permutation tests, observed
		values evaluation of optimal model parameters and predicted
		categories, bootstrap values evaluation of optimal model
		parameters and predicted cross-validated categories. The use of
		this package is described in Brandolini-Bunlon et al (2019,
		Multi-block PLS discriminant analysis for the joint analysis of
		metabolomic and epidemiological data (submitted in
		Metabolomics)).
