		Programmatic Way to Construct Complex Filtering Queries // Syntax
		for defining complex filtering expressions in a programmatic
		way. A filtering query, built as a nested list configuration,
		can be easily stored in other formats like 'YAML' or 'JSON'.
		What's more, it's possible to convert such configuration to a
		valid expression that can be applied to popular 'dplyr' package
		operations.
