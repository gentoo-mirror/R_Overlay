		Tools for Fast Computing and Visualizing Euclidean Minimum
		Spanning Trees // Fast and easily computes an Euclidean Minimum
		Spanning Tree (EMST) from data, relying on the R API for
		'mlpack' - the C++ Machine Learning Library (Curtin et. al.,
		2013). 'emstreeR' uses the Dual-Tree Boruvka (March, Ram, Gray,
		2010, doi:10.1145/1835804.1835882), which is theoretically and
		empirically the fastest algorithm for computing an EMST. This
		package also provides functions and an S3 method for readily
		visualizing Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) using either the style
		of the 'base', 'scatterplot3d', or 'ggplot2' libraries; and
		functions to export the MST output to shapefiles.
