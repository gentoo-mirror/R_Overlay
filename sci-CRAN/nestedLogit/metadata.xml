		Nested Dichotomy Logistic Regression Models // Provides functions
		for specifying and fitting nested dichotomy logistic regression
		models for a multi-category response and methods for
		summarising those models.  Nested dichotomies are statistically
		independent, and hence provide an additive decomposition of
		tests for the overall 'polytomous' response.  When the
		dichotomies make sense substantively, this method can be a
		simpler alternative to the standard 'multinomial' logistic
		model which compares response categories to a reference level.

		Generalized Linear Models", 3rd Ed., ISBN 1452205663.
