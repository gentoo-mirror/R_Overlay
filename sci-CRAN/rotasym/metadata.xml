		Tests for Rotational Symmetry on the Hypersphere //
		Implementation of the tests for rotational symmetry on the
		hypersphere proposed in Garca-Portugus, Paindaveine and
		Verdebout (2019) arXiv:1706.05030. The package also implements
		the proposed distributions on the hypersphere, based on the
		tangent-normal decomposition, and allows for the replication of
		the data application considered in the paper.
