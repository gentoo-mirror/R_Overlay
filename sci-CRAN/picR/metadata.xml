		Predictive Information Criteria for Model Selection //
		Computation of predictive information criteria (PIC) from
		select model object classes for model selection in predictive
		contexts. In contrast to the more widely used Akaike
		Information Criterion (AIC), which are derived under the
		assumption that target(s) of prediction (i.e. validation data)
		are independently and identically distributed to the fitting
		data, the PIC are derived under less restrictive assumptions
		and thus generalize AIC to the more practically relevant case
		of training/validation data heterogeneity. The methodology
		featured in this package is based on Flores (2021)
