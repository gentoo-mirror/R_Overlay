		Generate Heatmaps Based on Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) //
		Data are partitioned (clustered) into k clusters "around
		medoids", which is a more robust version of K-means implemented
		in the function pam() in the 'cluster' package. The PAM
		algorithm is described in Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990)
		doi:10.1002/9780470316801. Please refer to the pam() function
		documentation for more references. Clustered data is plotted as
		a split heatmap allowing visualisation of representative
		"group-clusters" (medoids) in the data as separated fractions
		of the graph while those "sub-clusters" are visualised as a
		traditional heatmap based on hierarchical clustering.
