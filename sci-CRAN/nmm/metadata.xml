		Nonlinear Multivariate Models // Estimates a subset of nonlinear
		multivariate models (NMM): system of nonlinear regressions
		(SNR), logit, and a joint model of SNR and logit. 'nmm'
		uniquely accounts for correlations between the error terms from
		nonlinear regressions and the probabilities from logit models.
		It also enables a very flexible design of logit: alternative-
		specific indirect utilities, individual-specific choice set and
		number of actual choices.
