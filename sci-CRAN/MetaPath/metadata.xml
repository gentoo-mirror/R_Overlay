		Perform the Meta-Analysis for Pathway Enrichment Analysis (MAPE)
		// Perform the Meta-analysis for Pathway Enrichment (MAPE)
		methods introduced by Shen and Tseng (2010). It includes
		functions to automatically perform MAPE_G (integrating multiple
		studies at gene level), MAPE_P (integrating multiple studies at
		pathway level) and MAPE_I (a hybrid method integrating MAEP_G
		and MAPE_P methods). In the simulation and real data analyses
		in the paper, MAPE_G and MAPE_P have complementary advantages
		and detection power depending on the data structure. In
		general, the integrative form of MAPE_I is recommended to use.
		In the case that MAPE_G (or MAPE_P) detects almost none
		pathway, the integrative MAPE_I does not improve performance
		and MAPE_P (or MAPE_G) should be used. Reference: Shen, Kui,
		and George C Tseng. Meta-analysis for pathway enrichment
