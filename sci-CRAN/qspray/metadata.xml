		Multivariate Polynomials with Rational Coefficients // Symbolic
		calculation and evaluation of multivariate polynomials with
		rational coefficients. This package is strongly inspired by the
		'spray' package. It provides a function to compute Grbner bases
		(reference doi:10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3). It also includes
		some features for symmetric polynomials, such as the Hall inner
		product. The header file of the C++ code can be used by other
		packages. It provides the templated class 'Qspray' that can be
		used to represent and to deal with multivariate polynomials
		with another type of coefficients.
