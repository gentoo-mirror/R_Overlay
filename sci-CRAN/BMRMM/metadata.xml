		An Implementation of the Bayesian Markov (Renewal) Mixed Models
		// The Bayesian Markov renewal mixed models take sequentially
		observed categorical data with continuous duration times, being
		either state duration or inter-state duration. These models
		comprehensively analyze the stochastic dynamics of both state
		transitions and duration times under the influence of multiple
		exogenous factors and random individual effect. The default
		setting flexibly models the transition probabilities using
		Dirichlet mixtures and the duration times using gamma mixtures.
		It also provides the flexibility of modeling the categorical
		sequences using Bayesian Markov mixed models alone, either
		ignoring the duration times altogether or dividing duration
		time into multiples of an additional category in the sequence
		by a user-specific unit. The package allows extensive inference
		of the state transition probabilities and the duration times as
		well as relevant plots and graphs. It also includes a synthetic
		data set to demonstrate the desired format of input data set
		and the utility of various functions. Methods for Bayesian
		Markov renewal mixed models are as described in: Abhra Sarkar
		et al., (2018) doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1423986 and Yutong Wu
		et al., (2022) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxac050.
