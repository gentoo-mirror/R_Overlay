		Estimation of a Broad Family of EGARCH Models // Implement and
		fit a variety of models from a very broad family of exponential
		generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
		(EGARCH) models, such as a MEGARCH (modified EGARCH), FIEGARCH
		(fractionally integrated EGARCH), FIMLog-GARCH (fractionally
		integrated modulus Log-GARCH), and more. The FIMLog-GARCH as
		part of the EGARCH family is discussed in Feng et al. (2023)
		https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pdnciepap/156.htm. For
		convenience and the purpose of comparison, a variety of other
		popular GARCH-type models, like an APARCH model, a fractionally
		integrated APARCH (FIAPARCH) model, standard GARCH and
		fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) models, GJR-GARCH and
		FIGJR-GARCH models, TGARCH and FITGARCH models, are
		implemented. Models are fitted through quasi-maximum-likelihood
		estimation.
