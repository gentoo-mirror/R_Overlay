		SM/LM EGARCH  GARCH, VaR/ES Backtesting  Dual LM Extensions //
		Implement and fit a variety of short-memory (SM) and long-
		memory (LM) models from a very broad family of exponential
		generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
		(EGARCH) models, such as a MEGARCH (modified EGARCH), FIEGARCH
		(fractionally integrated EGARCH), FIMLog-GARCH (fractionally
		integrated modulus Log-GARCH), and more. The FIMLog-GARCH as
		part of the EGARCH family is discussed in Feng et al. (2023)
		https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pdnciepap/156.htm. For
		convenience and the purpose of comparison, a variety of other
		popular SM and LM GARCH-type models, like an APARCH model, a
		fractionally integrated APARCH (FIAPARCH) model, standard GARCH
		and fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) models, GJR-GARCH
		and FIGJR-GARCH models, TGARCH and FITGARCH models, are
		implemented as well as dual models with simultaneous modelling
		of the mean, including dual long-memory models with a
		fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (FARIMA)
		model in the mean and a long-memory model in the variance, and
		semiparametric volatility model extensions. Parametric models
		and parametric model parts are fitted through quasi-maximum-
		likelihood estimation. Furthermore, common forecasting and
		backtesting functions for value-at-risk (VaR) and expected
		shortfall (ES) based on the package's models are provided.
