		SA Counterparty Credit Risk under Basel III // Computes the
		Exposure-At-Default based on standardized approach of the Basel
		III Regulatory framework (SA-CCR). Currently, trade types of
		all the five major asset classes have been created and, given
		the inheritance- based structure of the application, the
		addition of further trade types is straightforward. The
		application returns a list of trees (one per CSA) after
		automatically separating the trades based on the CSAs, the
		hedging sets, the netting sets and the risk factors. The basis
		and volatility transactions are also identified and treated in
		specific hedging sets whereby the corresponding penalty factors
		are applied. All the examples appearing on the regulatory paper
		(including the margined and the un-margined workflow) have been
		implemented including the latest FAQ enhancements.
