		SA Counterparty Credit Risk under CRR2 // Computes the Exposure-
		At-Default based on  the standardized approach of CRR2 (SA-
		CCR). The simplified version of SA-CCR has been included, as
		well as the OEM methodology. Multiple trade types of all the
		five major asset classes are being supported including the
		'Other' Exposure and, given the inheritance- based structure of
		the application, the addition of further trade types is
		straightforward. The application returns a list of trees per
		Counterparty and CSA after automatically separating the trades
		based on the Counterparty, the CSAs, the hedging sets, the
		netting sets and the risk factors. The basis and volatility
		transactions are also identified and treated in specific
		hedging sets whereby the corresponding penalty factors are
		applied. All the examples appearing on the regulatory papers
		(both for the margined and the un-margined workflow) have been
		implemented including the latest CRR2 developments.
