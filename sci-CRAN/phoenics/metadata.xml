		Pathways Longitudinal and Differential Analysis in Metabolomics
		// Perform a differential analysis at pathway level based on
		metabolite quantifications and information on pathway
		metabolite composition. The method, described in Guilmineau et
		al (2025) doi:10.1186/s12859-025-06118-z is based on a
		Principal Component Analysis step and on a linear mixed model.
		Automatic query of metabolic pathways is also implemented.
