		Interpretable Machine Learning and Statistical Inference with
		Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) // Accumulated Local Effects
		(ALE) were initially developed as a model-agnostic approach for
		global explanations of the results of black-box machine
		learning algorithms. (Apley, Daniel W., and Jingyu Zhu.
		"Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box
		supervised learning models." Journal of the Royal Statistical
		Society Series B: Statistical Methodology 82.4 (2020):
		1059-1086 doi:10.1111/rssb.12377.) ALE has two primary
		advantages over other approaches like partial dependency plots
		(PDP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP): its values are
		not affected by the presence of interactions among variables in
		a model and its computation is relatively rapid. This package
		rewrites the original code from the 'ALEPlot' package for
		calculating ALE data and it completely reimplements the
		plotting of ALE values. Future versions hope to extend the
		original ALE concept beyond global explanations with ALE-based
		measures that can be used for statistical inference as well as
		an ALE-based approach for local explanations.
