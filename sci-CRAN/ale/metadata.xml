		Interpretable Machine Learning and Statistical Inference with
		Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) // Accumulated Local Effects
		(ALE) were initially developed as a model-agnostic approach for
		global explanations of the results of black-box machine
		learning algorithms. ALE has a key advantage over other
		approaches like partial dependency plots (PDP) and SHapley
		Additive exPlanations (SHAP): its values represent a clean
		functional decomposition of the model. As such, ALE values are
		not affected by the presence or absence of interactions among
		variables in a mode. Moreover, its computation is relatively
		rapid. This package rewrites the original code from the
		'ALEPlot' package for calculating ALE data and it completely
		reimplements the plotting of ALE values. It also extends the
		original ALE concept to add bootstrap-based confidence
		intervals and ALE-based statistics that can be used for
		statistical inference. For more details, see Okoli, Chitu.
