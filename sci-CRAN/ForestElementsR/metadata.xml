		Data Structures and Functions for Working with Forest Data //
		Provides generic data structures and algorithms for use with
		forest mensuration data in a consistent framework. The
		functions and objects included are a collection of broadly
		applicable tools. More specialized applications should be
		implemented in separate packages that build on this foundation.
		Documentation about 'ForestElementsR' is provided by three
		vignettes included in this package. For an introduction to the
		field of forest mensuration, refer to the textbooks by Kershaw
		et al. (2017) doi:10.1002/9781118902028, and van Laar and Akca
		(2007) doi:10.1007/978-1-4020-5991-9.
