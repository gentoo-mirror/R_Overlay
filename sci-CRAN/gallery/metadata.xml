		Generate Test Matrices for Numerical Experiments // Generates a
		variety of structured test matrices commonly used in numerical
		linear algebra and computational experiments. Includes well-
		known matrices for benchmarking and testing the performance,
		stability, and accuracy of linear algebra algorithms. Inspired
		by 'MATLAB' 'gallery' functions.
