		Tree-Based Moving Average Forecasting Model // We provide a
		forecasting model for time series forecasting problems with
		predictors. The offered model, which is based on a submitted
		research and called tree-based moving average (TBMA),  is based
		on the integration of the moving average approach to tree-based
		ensemble approach.  The tree-based ensemble models can capture
		the complex correlations between the predictors and response
		variable but lack in modelling time series components. The
		integration of the moving average approach to the tree-based
		ensemble approach helps the TBMA model to handle both
		correlations and autocorrelations in time series data. This
		package provides a tbma() forecasting function that utilizes
		the ranger() function from the 'ranger' package. With the help
		of the ranger() function, various types of tree-based ensemble
		models, such as extremely randomized trees and random forests,
		can be used in the TBMA model.
