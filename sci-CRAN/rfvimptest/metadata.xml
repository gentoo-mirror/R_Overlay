		Sequential Permutation Testing of Random Forest Variable
		Importance Measures // Sequential permutation testing for
		statistical significance of predictors in random forests. The
		main function of the package is rfvimptest(), which allows to
		test for the statistical significance of predictors in random
		forests using different (sequential) permutation test
		strategies. The advantage of sequential over conventional
		permutation tests is that they are computationally considerably
		less intensive, as the sequential procedure is stopped as soon
		as there is sufficient evidence for either the null or the
		alternative hypothesis.
