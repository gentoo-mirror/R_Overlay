		Sequential Permutation Testing of Random Forest Variable
		Importance Measures // Sequential permutation testing for
		statistical significance of predictors in random forests and
		other prediction methods. The main function of the package is
		rfvimptest(), which allows to test for the   statistical
		significance of predictors in random forests using different
		(sequential) permutation test strategies [1]. The advantage of
		sequential over conventional permutation tests is that they are
		computationally considerably less intensive, as the sequential
		procedure is stopped as soon as there is sufficient evidence
		for either the null or the alternative hypothesis. Reference:
