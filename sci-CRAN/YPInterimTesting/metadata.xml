		Interim Monitoring Using Adaptively Weighted Log-Rank Test in
		Clinical Trials // Provide monitoring boundaries for interim
		testing using the adaptively weighted log-rank test developed
		by Yang and Prentice (2010
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01243.x). The package use a re-
		sampling method to obtain stopping boundaries in sequential
		designs. The output consists of stopping boundaries at the
		interim looks along with nominal p-values defined as the
		probability of the test exceeding the specific observed value
		or critical value, regardless of the test behavior at other
		looks. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistics of
		the adaptively weighted log-rank test at the interim looks is
		examined in Yang (2017, pre-print).
