		Interim Monitoring Using Adaptively Weighted Log-Rank Test in
		Clinical Trials // For any spending function specified by the
		user, this package provides corresponding boundaries for
		interim testing using the adaptively weighted log-rank test
		developed by Yang and Prentice (2010
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01243.x). The package uses a re-
		sampling method to obtain stopping boundaries at the interim
		looks.The output consists of stopping boundaries and observed
		values of the test statistics at the interim looks, along with
		nominal p-values defined as the probability of the test
		exceeding the specific observed test statistic value or
		critical value, regardless of the test behavior at other looks.
		The asymptotic validity of the stopping boundaries is
		established in Yang (2018 doi:10.1002/sim.7958).
