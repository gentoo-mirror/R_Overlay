		Linear Model with Tree-Based Lasso Regularization for Rare
		Features // Implementation of an alternating direction method
		of multipliers algorithm for fitting a linear model with tree-
		based lasso regularization, which is proposed in Algorithm 1 of
		Yan and Bien (2020) doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1796677. The
		package allows efficient model fitting on the entire
		2-dimensional regularization path for large datasets. The
		complete set of functions also makes the entire process of
		tuning regularization parameters and visualizing results
		hassle-free.
