		Outlier Detection Using Invariant Coordinate Selection //
		Multivariate outlier detection is performed using invariant
		coordinates where the package offers different methods to
		choose the appropriate components. ICS is a general
		multivariate technique with many applications in multivariate
		analysis. ICSOutlier offers a selection of functions for
		automated detection of outliers in the data based on a fitted
		ICS object or by specifying the dataset and the scatters of
		interest. The current implementation targets data sets with
		only a small percentage of outliers.
