		Multiple Contrast Tests for Functional Data // The provided
		package implements multiple contrast tests for functional data
		(Munko et al., 2023, arXiv:2306.15259). These procedures enable
		us to evaluate the overall hypothesis regarding equality, as
		well as specific hypotheses defined by contrasts. In
		particular, we can perform post hoc tests to examine particular
		comparisons of interest. Different experimental designs are
		supported, e.g., one-way and multi-way analysis of variance for
		functional data.
