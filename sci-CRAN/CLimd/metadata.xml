		Generating Rainfall Rasters from IMD NetCDF Data // The developed
		function is a comprehensive tool for the analysis of India
		Meteorological Department (IMD) NetCDF rainfall data.
		Specifically designed to process high-resolution daily gridded
		rainfall datasets. It provides four key functions to process
		IMD NetCDF rainfall data and create rasters for various
		temporal scales, including annual, seasonal, monthly, and
		weekly rainfall. For method details see, Malik, A.
		(2019).DOI:10.1007/s12517-019-4454-5. It supports different
		aggregation methods, such as sum, min, max, mean, and standard
		deviation. These functions are designed for spatio-temporal
		analysis of rainfall patterns, trend analysis,geostatistical
		modeling of rainfall variability, identifying rainfall
		anomalies and extreme events and can be an input for
		hydrological and agricultural models.
