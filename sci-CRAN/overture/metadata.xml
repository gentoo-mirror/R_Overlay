		Tools for Writing MCMC // Simplifies MCMC setup by automatically
		looping through sampling functions and saving the results.
		Reduces the memory footprint of running MCMC and saves samples
		to disk as the chain runs.  Allows samples from the chain to be
		analyzed while the MCMC is still running.  Provides functions
		for commonly performed operations such as calculating
		Metropolis acceptance ratios and creating adaptive Metropolis
		samplers.  References: Roberts and Rosenthal (2009)
