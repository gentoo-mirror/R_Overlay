		Toolkit of Helper Functions to Pre-Process Amplification Data //
		A collection of functions to pre-process amplification curve
		data from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or isothermal
		amplification reactions. Contains functions to normalize and
		baseline amplification curves, to detect both the start and end
		of an amplification reaction, several smoothers (e.g., LOWESS,
		moving average, cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay), a function to
		detect false positive amplification reactions and a function to
		determine the amplification efficiency. Quantification point
		(Cq) methods include the first (FDM) and second approximate
		derivative maximum (SDM) methods (calculated by a 5-point-
		stencil) and the cycle threshold method. Data sets of
		experimental nucleic acid amplification systems ('VideoScan
		HCU', capillary convective PCR (ccPCR)) and commercial systems
		are included. Amplification curves were generated by helicase
		dependent amplification (HDA), ccPCR or PCR. As detection
		system intercalating dyes (EvaGreen, SYBR Green) and hydrolysis
		probes (TaqMan) were used. For more information see: Roediger
		et al. (2015) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv205.
