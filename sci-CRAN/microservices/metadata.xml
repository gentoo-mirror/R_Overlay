		Breakdown a Monolithic Application to a Suite of Services //
		'Microservice' architectural style is an approach to developing
		a single application as a suite of small services, each running
		in its own process and communicating with lightweight
		mechanisms, often an 'HTTP' resource 'API'. These services are
		built around business capabilities and independently deployable
		by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare
		minimum of centralized management of these services, which may
		be written in different programming languages and use different
		data storage technologies.
