		Unconstrained Numerical Optimization Algorithms // Optimization
		algorithms implemented in R, including conjugate gradient (CG),
		Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the limited memory
		BFGS (L-BFGS) methods. Most internal parameters can be set
		through the call interface. The solvers hold up quite well for
		higher-dimensional problems.
