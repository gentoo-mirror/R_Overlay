		Epilepsy Ontology Similarities // Analysis and visualization of
		similarities between epilepsy ontologies based on text mining
		results by comparing ranked lists of co-occurring drug terms in
		the corpus of LIVIVO. The ranked result lists of neurological
		drug terms co-occurring with named entities from the epilepsy
		ontologies EpSO, ESSO, and EPILONT are aggregated in order to
		generate two different results: an overview table of drugs that
		are relevant to epilepsy created with the method
		createNeuroTable, and a plot of tanimoto similarity
		coefficients between the aggregated list of drug terms against
		the list of drug terms from each of the ontologies created with
		the method createTanimotoBaseline(). The alignment of the Top-K
		Ranked Lists is conducted using the R-package TopKLists
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=TopKLists. The source data
		to create the ranked lists of drug names is produced using the
		text mining workflows described in Mueller, Bernd and
		Hagelstein, Alexandra (2016) doi:10.4126/FRL01-006408558 and
		Mueller, Bernd et al. (2017) doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58694-6_22.
