		The Poisson Binomial Distribution // Implementation of both the
		exact and approximation methods for computing the cdf of the
		Poisson binomial distribution. It also provides the pmf,
		quantile function, and random number generation for the Poisson
		binomial distribution. We would like to acknowledge that the C
		code for FFT is adopted from R distribution (fft.c, by Ross
		Ihaka from University of Auckland, dated February 1997).
