		The Poisson Binomial Distribution // Implementation of both the
		exact and approximation methods for computing the cdf of the
		Poisson binomial distribution as described in Hong (2013) doi:
		10.1016/j.csda.2012.10.006. It also provides the pmf, quantile
		function, and random number generation for the Poisson binomial
		distribution. The C code for fast Fourier transformation (FFT)
		is written by R Core Team (2019)https://www.R-project.org/,
		which implements the FFT algorithm in Singleton (1969) doi:
		10.1109/TAU.1969.1162042.
