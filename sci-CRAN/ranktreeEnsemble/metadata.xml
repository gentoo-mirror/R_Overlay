		Ensemble Models of Rank-Based Trees with Extracted Decision Rules
		// Fast computing an ensemble of rank-based trees via boosting
		or random forest on binary and multi-class problems. It
		converts continuous gene expression profiles into ranked gene
		pairs, for which the variable importance indices are computed
		and adopted for dimension reduction. Decision rules can be
		extracted from trees.
