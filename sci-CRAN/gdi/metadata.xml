		Volumetric Analysis using Graphic Double Integration // Tools
		implementing an automated version of the graphic double
		integration technique (GDI) for volume implementation, and some
		other related utilities for paleontological image-analysis. GDI
		was first employed by Jerison (1973) ISBN:9780323141086 and
		Hurlburt (1999) doi:10.1080/02724634.1999.10011145 and is
		primarily used for volume or mass estimation of (extinct)
		animals. The package 'gdi' aims to make this technique as
		convenient and versatile as possible. The core functions of
		'gdi' provide utilities for automatically measuring diameters
		from digital silhouettes provided as image files and
		calculating volume via graphic double integration with simple
		elliptical, superelliptical (following Motani 2001
		doi:10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027%3C0735:EBMFST%3E2.0.CO;2) or
		complex cross-sectional models. Additionally, the package
		provides functions for estimating the center of mass position
		(COM), the moment of inertia (I) for 3D shapes and the second
		moment of area (Ix, Iy, Iz) of 2D cross-sections, as well as
		for visualization of results.
