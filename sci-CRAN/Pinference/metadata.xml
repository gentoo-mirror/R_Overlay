		Probability Inference for Propositional Logic // Implementation
		of T. Hailperin's procedure to calculate lower and upper bounds
		of the probability for a propositional-logic expression, given
		equality and inequality constraints on the probabilities for
		other expressions. Truth-valuation is included as a special
		case. Applications range from decision-making and probabilistic
		reasoning, to pedagogical for probability and logic courses.
		For more details see T. Hailperin (1965)
