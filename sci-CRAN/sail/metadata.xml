		Sparse Additive Interaction Learning // Sparse additive
		interaction learning with the strong heredity property, i.e.,
		an interaction is selected only if its corresponding main
		effects are also included. Fits a linear model with non-linear
		interactions via penalized maximum likelihood. Interactions are
		limited to a single exposure or environment variable. For more
		information, see the website below and the accompanying paper:
		Bhatnagar et al., "A sparse additive model for high-dimensional
		interactions with an exposure variable", 2019,
		DOI:10.1101/445304.
