		Fit Structural Equation Models to Multiply Imputed Data // The
		primary purpose of 'lavaan.mi' is to extend the functionality
		of the R package 'lavaan', which implements structural equation
		modeling (SEM).  When incomplete data have been multiply
		imputed, the imputed data sets can be analyzed by 'lavaan'
		using complete-data estimation methods, but results must be
		pooled across imputations (Rubin, 1987,
		doi:10.1002/9780470316696). The 'lavaan.mi' package automates
		the pooling of point and standard-error estimates, as well as a
		variety of test statistics, using a familiar interface that
		allows users to fit an SEM to multiple imputations as they
		would to a single data set using the 'lavaan' package.
