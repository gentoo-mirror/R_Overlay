		Accelerated Functional Failure Time Model with Error-Contaminated
		Survival Times // We aim to deal with data with measurement
		error in the response and misclassification censoring status
		under an AFT model. This package primarily contains three
		functions, which are used to generate artificial data,
		correction for error-prone data and estimate the functional
		covariates for an AFT model.
