		Dataframes Based on Titanic Passengers and Crew // A version of
		the Titanic survival data tailored for people analytics
		demonstrations and practice. While another package, 'titanic',
		reproduces the Kaggle competition files with minimal
		preprocessing, 'tidytitanic' combines the train and test
		datasets into the single dataset, 'passengers', for exploration
		and summary across all passengers. It also extracts personal
		identifierssuch as first names, last names, and titles from the
		raw 'name' field, enabling demographic analysis. The
		'passengers' data does not cover the crew, but this package
		also provides the more bare-bones, crew-containing datasets
		'tidy_titanic' and 'flat_titanic' based on the 'Titanic' data
		set from 'datasets' for further exploration. This human-
		centered data package is designed to support exploratory data
		analysis, feature engineering, and pedagogical use cases.
