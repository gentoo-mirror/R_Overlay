		Online Principal Component Regression for Online Datasets // The
		online principal component regression method can process the
		online data set. 'OPCreg' implements the online principal
		component regression method, which is specifically designed to
		process online datasets efficiently. This method is
		particularly useful for handling large-scale, streaming data
		where traditional batch processing methods may be
		computationally infeasible.The philosophy of the package is
		described in 'Guo' (2025) doi:10.1016/j.physa.2024.130308.
