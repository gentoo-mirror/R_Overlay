		Bayesian Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) with 'Stan' // Implements
		Bayesian dynamic factor analysis with 'Stan'. Dynamic factor
		analysis is a dimension reduction tool for multivariate time
		series. 'bayesdfa' extends conventional dynamic factor models
		in several ways. First, extreme events may be estimated in the
		latent trend by modeling process error with a student-t
		distribution. Second, autoregressive and moving average
		components can be optionally included. Third, the estimated
		dynamic factors can be analyzed with hidden Markov models to
		evaluate support for latent regimes.
