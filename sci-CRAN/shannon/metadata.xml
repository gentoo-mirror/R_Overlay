		Computation of Entropy Measures and Relative Loss // The
		functions allow for the numerical evaluation of some commonly
		used entropy measures, such as Shannon entropy, Rnyi entropy,
		Havrda and Charvat entropy, and Arimoto entropy, at selected
		parametric values from several well-known and widely used
		probability distributions. Moreover, the functions also compute
		the relative loss of these entropies using the truncated
		distributions. Related works include: Awad, A. M.,  Alawneh, A.
		J. (1987). Application of entropy to a life-time model. IMA
		Journal of Mathematical Control and Information, 4(2), 143-148.
