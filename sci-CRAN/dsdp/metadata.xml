		Density Estimation with Semidefinite Programming // The models of
		probability density functions are Gaussian or exponential
		distributions with polynomial correction terms. Using a maximum
		likelihood method, 'dsdp' computes parameters of Gaussian or
		exponential distributions together with degrees of polynomials
		by a grid search, and coefficient of polynomials by a variant
		of semidefinite programming. It adopts Akaike Information
		Criterion for model selection. See a vignette for a tutorial
		and more on our 'Github' repository
		https://github.com/tsuchiya-lab/dsdp/.
