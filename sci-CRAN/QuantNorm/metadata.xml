		Mitigating the Adverse Impact of Batch Effects in Sample Pattern
		Detection // Modifies the distance matrix obtained from data
		with batch effects, so as to improve the performance of sample
		pattern detection, such as clustering, dimension reduction, and
		construction of networks between subjects. The method has been
		published in Bioinformatics (Fei et al, 2018,
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty117). Also available on 'GitHub'
