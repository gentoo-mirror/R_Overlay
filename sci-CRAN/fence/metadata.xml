		Using Fence Methods for Model Selection // This method is a new
		class of model selection strategies, for mixed model selection,
		which includes linear and generalized linear mixed models. The
		idea involves a procedure to isolate a subgroup of what are
		known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a
		member). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical
		fence, or barrier, to carefully eliminate incorrect models.
		Once the fence is constructed, the optimal model is selected
		from among those within the fence according to a criterion
		which can be made flexible. References: 1. Jiang J., Rao J.S.,
