		'DEploid' Data Analysis and Results Interpretation // 'DEploid'
		(Zhu et.al. 2018 doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx530) is designed
		for deconvoluting mixed genomes with unknown proportions.
		Traditional phasing programs are limited to diploid organisms.
		Our method modifies Li and Stephens algorithm with Markov chain
		Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches, and builds a generic framework
		that allows haloptype searches in a multiple infection setting.
		This package provides R functions to support data analysis and
		results interpretation.
