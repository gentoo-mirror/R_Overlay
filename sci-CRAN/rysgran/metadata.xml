		Grain size analysis, textural classifications and distribution of
		unconsolidated sediments // This package is a port to R of the
		SysGran program, written in Delphi by Camargo (2006). It
		contains functions for the analysis of grain size samples (in
		logarithmic (phi) and geometric (micrometers) scale) based on
		various methods, like Folk  Ward (1957) and Methods of Moments
		(Tanner, 1995), among others; textural classifications and
		distribution of unconsolidated sediments are shown in
		histograms, bivariated plots and ternary diagrams of Shepard
		(1954) and Pejrup (1988). English and Portuguese languages are
		supported in outputs
