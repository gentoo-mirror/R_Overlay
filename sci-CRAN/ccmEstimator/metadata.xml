		Comparative Causal Mediation Estimation // Functions to perform
		comparative causal mediation analysis to compare the mediation
		effects of different treatments via a common mediator. Results
		contain the estimates and confidence intervals for the two
		comparative causal mediation analysis estimands, as well as the
		ATE and ACME for each treatment. Functions provided in the
		package will automatically assess the comparative causal
		mediation analysis scope conditions (i.e. for each comparative
		causal mediation estimand, a numerator and denominator that are
		both estimated with the desired statistical significance and of
		the same sign). Results will be returned for each comparative
		causal mediation estimand only if scope conditions are met for
		it. See details in Bansak(2020)doi:10.1017/pan.2019.31.
