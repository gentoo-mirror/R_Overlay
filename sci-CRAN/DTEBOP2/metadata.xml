		Bayesian Optimal Phase II Randomized Clinical Trial Design with
		Delayed Outcomes // Implements a Bayesian Optimal Phase II
		design (DTE-BOP2) for trials with delayed treatment effects,
		particularly relevant to immunotherapy studies where treatment
		benefits may emerge after a delay. The method builds upon the
		BOP2 framework and incorporates uncertainty in the delay
		timepoint through a truncated gamma prior, informed by expert
		knowledge or default settings. Supports two-arm trial designs
		with functionality for sample size determination, interim and
		final analyses, and comprehensive simulation under various
		delay and design scenarios. Ensures rigorous type I and II
		error control while improving trial efficiency and power when
		the delay effect is present. A manuscript describing the
		methodology is under development and will be formally
		referenced upon publication.
