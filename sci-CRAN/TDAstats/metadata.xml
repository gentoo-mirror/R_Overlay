		Pipeline for Topological Data Analysis // A comprehensive toolset
		for any useR conducting topological data analysis, specifically
		via the calculation of persistent homology in a Vietoris-Rips
		complex. The tools this package currently provides can be
		conveniently split into three main sections: (1) calculating
		persistent homology; (2) conducting statistical inference on
		persistent homology calculations; (3) visualizing persistent
		homology and statistical inference. For a general background on
		computing persistent homology for topological data analysis,
		see Otter et al. (2017) doi:10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0109-5. To
		learn more about how the permutation test is used for
		nonparametric statistical inference in topological data
		analysis, read Robinson  Turner (2017)
		doi:10.1007/s41468-017-0008-7. To learn more about how TDAstats
		calculates persistent homology, you can visit the GitHub
		repository for Ripser, the software that works behind the
		scenes at https://github.com/Ripser/ripser.
