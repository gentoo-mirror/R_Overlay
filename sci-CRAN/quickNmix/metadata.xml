		Asymptotic N-Mixture Model Fitting // For fitting N-mixture
		models using either FFT or asymptotic approaches. FFT N-mixture
		models extend the work of Cowen et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1111/biom.12701. Asymptotic N-mixture models extend the
		work of Dail and Madsen (2011)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01465.x, to consider asymptotic
		solutions to the open population N-mixture models. The FFT
		models are derived and described in "Parker, M.R.P., Elliott,
		L., Cowen, L.L.E. (2022). Computational efficiency and
		precision for replicated-count and batch-marked hidden
		population models [Manuscript in preparation]. Department of
		Statistics and Actuarial Sciences, Simon Fraser University.".
		The asymptotic models are derived and described in: "Parker,
		M.R.P., Elliott, L., Cowen, L.L.E., Cao, J. (2022). Fast
		asymptotic solutions for N-mixtures on large populations
		[Manuscript in preparation]. Department of Statistics and
		Actuarial Sciences, Simon Fraser University.".
