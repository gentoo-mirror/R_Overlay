		Conducts Analyses Informing Ecosystem Restoration Decisions //
		Three sets of data and functions for informing ecosystem
		restoration decisions, particularly in the context of the U.S.
		Army Corps of Engineers. First, model parameters are compiled
		as a data set and associated metadata for over 500 habitat
		suitability models developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
		Service (USFWS 1980) https://www.fws.gov/policy/ESMindex.html.
		Second, functions for conducting habitat suitability analyses
		both for the models described above as well as generic user-
		specified model parameterizations. Third, a suite of decision
		support tools for conducting cost-effectiveness and incremental
		cost analyses (Robinson et al. 1995) https://www.iwr.usace.army
		.mil/Portals/70/docs/iwrreports/95-R-1.pdf.
