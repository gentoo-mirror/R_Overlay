		Conducts Analyses Informing Ecosystem Restoration Decisions //
		Three sets of data and functions for informing ecosystem
		restoration decisions, particularly in the context of the U.S.
		Army Corps of Engineers. First, model parameters are compiled
		as a data set and associated metadata for over 300 habitat
		suitability models developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
		Service (USFWS 1980, https://www.fws.gov/policy-
		library/870fw1). Second, functions for conducting habitat
		suitability analyses both for the models described above as
		well as generic user-specified model parameterizations. Third,
		a suite of decision support tools for conducting cost-
		effectiveness and incremental cost analyses (Robinson et al.
		1995, IWR Report 95-R-1, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers).
