		EM Algorithms for Estimating Item Response Theory Models //
		Various Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms are
		implemented for item response theory (IRT) models. The package
		includes IRT models for binary and ordinal responses, along
		with dynamic and hierarchical IRT models with binary responses.
		The latter two models are fitted using variational EM.  The
		package also includes variational network and text scaling
		models.  The algorithms are described in Imai, Lo, and Olmsted
		(2016) DOI:10.1017/S000305541600037X.
