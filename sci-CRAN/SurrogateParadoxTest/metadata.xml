		Empirical Testing of Surrogate Paradox Assumptions // Provides
		functions to nonparametrically assess assumptions necessary to
		prevent the surrogate paradox through hypothesis tests of
		stochastic dominance, monotonicity of regression functions, and
		non-negative residual treatment effects. More details are
		available in Hsiao et al 2024 (under review).
