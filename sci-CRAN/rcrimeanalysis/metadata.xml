		of functions for the analysis of crime incident or records
		management system data. The package implements analysis
		algorithms scaled for city or regional crime analysis units.
		The package provides functions for kernel density estimation
		for crime heat maps, geocoding using the 'Google Maps' API,
		spatio-temporal map comparison across time intervals, time
		series analysis (forecasting and decomposition), and near
		repeat analysis (with crime network linkage).
