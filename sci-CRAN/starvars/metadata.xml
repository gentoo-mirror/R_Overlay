		Vector Logistic Smooth Transition Models / Realized Covariances
		Construction // Allows the user to estimate a vector logistic
		smooth transition autoregressive model via maximum log-
		likelihood or nonlinear least squares. It further permits to
		test for linearity in the multivariate framework against a
		vector logistic smooth transition autoregressive model with a
		single transition variable. The estimation method is discussed
		in Terasvirta and Yang (2014,
		doi:10.1108/S0731-9053(2013)0000031008). Also, realized
		covariances can be constructed from stock market prices or
		returns, as explained in Andersen et al. (2001,
		doi:10.1016/S0304-405X(01)00055-1).
