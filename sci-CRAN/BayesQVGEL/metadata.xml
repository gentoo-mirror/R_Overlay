		Bayesian Variable Selection for G - E in Longitudinal Quantile
		Regression // In longitudinal studies, the same subjects are
		measured repeatedly over time, leading to correlations among
		the repeated measurements. Properly accounting for the intra-
		cluster correlations in the presence of data heterogeneity and
		long tailed distributions of the disease phenotype is
		challenging, especially in the context of high dimensional
		regressions. Here, we aim at developing novel Bayesian
		regularized quantile mixed effect models to tackle these
		challenges. We have proposed a Bayesian variable selection in
		the mixed effect models for longitudinal genomics studies. To
		dissect important gene - environment interactions, our model
		can simultaneously identify important main and interaction
		effects on the individual and group level, which have been
		facilitated by imposing the spike- and -slab priors through
		Laplacian shrinkage in the Bayesian quantile hierarchical
		models. The within - subject dependence among data can be
		accommodated by incorporating the random effects. An efficient
		Gibbs sampler has been developed to facilitate fast
		computation. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the
		proposed and alternative methods are efficiently implemented in
		'C++'. The development of this software package and the
		associated statistical methods have been partially supported by
		an Innovative Research Award from Johnson Cancer Research
		Center, Kansas State University.
