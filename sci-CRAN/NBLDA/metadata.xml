		Negative Binomial Linear Discriminant Analysis // We proposed a
		package for classification task which uses Negative Binomial
		distribution within Linear Discriminant Analysis (NBLDA). It is
		basically an extension of 'PoiClaClu' package to Negative
		Binomial distribution. The classification algorithms are based
		on the papers Dong et al. (2016, ISSN: 1471-2105) and Witten,
		DM (2011, ISSN: 1932-6157) for NBLDA and PLDA respectively.
		Although PLDA is a sparse algorithm and can be used for
		variable selection, the algorithm proposed by Dong et. al. is
		not sparse, hence, it uses all variables in the classifier.
		Here, we extent Dong et. al.'s algorithm to sparse case by
		shrinking overdispersion towards 0 (Yu et. al., 2013, ISSN:
		1367-4803) and offset parameter towards 1 (as proposed by
		Witten DM, 2011). We support only the classification task with
		this version. However, the clustering task will be included
		with the following versions.
