		Forecasting Models for Tidy Time Series // Provides a collection
		of commonly used univariate and multivariate time series
		forecasting models including automatically selected exponential
		smoothing (ETS) and autoregressive integrated moving average
		(ARIMA) models. These models work within the 'fable' framework
		provided by the 'fabletools' package, which provides the tools
		to evaluate, visualise, and combine models in a workflow
		consistent with the tidyverse.
