		Abstractions for Promise-Based Asynchronous Programming //
		Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous
		programming in R using promises. Asynchronous programming is
		useful for allowing a single R process to orchestrate multiple
		tasks in the background while also attending to something else.
		Semantics are similar to 'JavaScript' promises, but with a
		syntax that is idiomatic R.
