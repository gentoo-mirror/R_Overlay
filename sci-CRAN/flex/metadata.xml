		Fuzzy Linear Squares Estimation with Explicit Formula (FLEX) //
		The FLEX method, developed by Yoon and Choi (2013)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-642-33042-1_21, performs least squares
		estimation for fuzzy predictors and outcomes, generating crisp
		regression coefficients by minimizing the distance between
		observed and predicted outcomes. It also provides functions for
		fuzzifying data and inference tasks, including significance
		testing, fit indices, and confidence interval estimation.
