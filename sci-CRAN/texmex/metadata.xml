		Statistical Modelling of Extreme Values // Statistical extreme
		value modelling of threshold excesses, maxima and multivariate
		extremes. Univariate models for threshold excesses and maxima
		are the Generalised Pareto, and Generalised Extreme Value model
		respectively. These models may be fitted by using maximum
		(optionally penalised-)likelihood, or Bayesian estimation, and
		both classes of models may be fitted with covariates in any/all
		model parameters. Model diagnostics support the fitting
		process. Graphical output for visualising fitted models and
		return level estimates is provided. For serially dependent
		sequences, the intervals declustering algorithm of Ferro and
		Segers (2003) doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00401 is provided, with
		diagnostic support to aid selection of threshold and
		declustering horizon. Multivariate modelling is performed via
		the conditional approach of Heffernan and Tawn (2004)
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2004.02050.x, with graphical tools for
		threshold selection and to diagnose estimation convergence.
