		Identification of Hybrid Peptides in Immunopeptidomic Analyses //
		Tool for the analysis Mass Spectrometry (MS) data in the
		context of immunopeptidomic analysis for the identification of
		hybrid peptides and the predictions of binding affinity of all
		peptides using 'netMHCpan' doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa379 while
		providing a summary of the netMHCpan output. 'RHybridFinder'
		(RHF) is destined for researchers who are looking to analyze
		their MS data for the purpose of identification of potential
		spliced peptides. This package, developed mainly in base R, is
		based on the workflow published by Faridi et al. in 2018
		doi:10.1126/sciimmunol.aar3947.
