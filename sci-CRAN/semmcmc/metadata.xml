		Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling in Multiple Omics Data
		Integration // Provides Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine
		for the structural equation modelling described in Maity et.
		al. (2020) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa286. This MCMC
		sampler is useful when one attempts to perform an integrative
		survival analysis for multiple platforms of the Omics data
		where the response is time to event and the predictors are
		different omics expressions for different platforms.
