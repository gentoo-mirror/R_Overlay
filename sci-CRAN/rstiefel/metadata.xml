		Random Orthonormal Matrix Generation and Optimization on the
		Stiefel Manifold // Simulation of random orthonormal matrices
		from linear and quadratic exponential family distributions on
		the Stiefel manifold. The most general type of distribution
		covered is the matrix-variate  Bingham-von Mises-Fisher
		distribution. Most of the simulation methods are presented in
		Hoff(2009) "Simulation of the Matrix Bingham-von Mises-Fisher
		Distribution, With Applications to Multivariate and Relational
		Data" doi:10.1198/jcgs.2009.07177. The package also includes
		functions for optimization on the Stiefel manifold based on
		algorithms described in Wen and Yin (2013) "A feasible method
		for optimization with orthogonality constraints"
		doi:10.1007/s10107-012-0584-1.
