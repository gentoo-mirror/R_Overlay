		Performance Criteria Modeler for Discrete Trial Training //
		Provides a tool for computing probabilities and other
		quantities that are relevant in selecting performance criteria
		for discrete trial training. The main function, miebl(),
		computes Bayesian and frequentist probabilities and bounds for
		each of n possible performance criterion choices when
		attempting to determine a student's true mastery level by
		counting their number of successful attempts at displaying
		learning among n trials. The reporting function miebl_re()
		takes output from miebl() and prepares it into a brief report
		for a specific criterion. miebl_cp() combines 2 to 5
		distributions of true mastery level given performance criterion
		in one plot for comparison. Ramos (2025)
