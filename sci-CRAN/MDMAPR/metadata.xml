		Molecular Detection Mapping and Analysis Platform // Runs a Shiny
		web application that merges raw 'qPCR' fluorescence data with
		related metadata to visualize species presence/absence
		detection patterns and assess data quality. The application
		calculates threshold values from raw fluorescence data using a
		method based on the second derivative method, Luu-The et al
		(2005) doi:10.2144/05382RR05,  and utilizes the chipPCR package
		by Rdiger, Burdukiewicz,  Schierack (2015)
		doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv205 to calculate Cq values. The
		application has the ability to connect to a custom developed
		MySQL database to populate the applications interface. The
		application allows users to interact with visualizations such
		as a dynamic map, amplification curves and standard curves,
		that allow for zooming and/or filtering. It also enables the
		generation of customized exportable reports based on filtered
		mapping data.
