		Tools to Work with Survey Data // Data obtained from surveys
		contains information not only about the survey responses, but
		also the survey metadata, e.g. the original survey questions
		and the answer options. The surveydata package makes it easy to
		keep track of this metadata, and to easily extract columns with
		specific questions.
