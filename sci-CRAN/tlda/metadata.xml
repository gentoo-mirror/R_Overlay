		Tools for Language Data Analysis // Support functions and
		datasets to facilitate the analysis of linguistic data. The
		current focus is on the calculation of corpus-linguistic
		dispersion measures as described in Gries (2021)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-030-46216-1_5 and Soenning (2025)
		doi:10.3366/cor.2025.0326. The most commonly used parts-based
		indices are implemented, including different formulas and
		modifications that are found in the literature, with the
		additional option to obtain frequency-adjusted scores.
		Dispersion scores can be computed based on individual count
		variables or a term-document matrix.
