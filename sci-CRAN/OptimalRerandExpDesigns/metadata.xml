		Optimal Rerandomization Experimental Designs // This is a tool to
		find the optimal rerandomization threshold in non-sequential
		experiments. We offer three procedures based on assumptions
		made on the residuals distribution: (1) normality assumed (2)
		excess kurtosis assumed (3) entire distribution assumed.
		Illustrations are included. Also included is a routine to
		unbiasedly estimate Frobenius norms of variance-covariance
		matrices. Details of the method can be found in "Optimal
		Rerandomization via a Criterion that Provides Insurance Against
		Failed Experiments" Adam Kapelner, Abba M. Krieger, Michael
		Sklar and David Azriel (2020) arXiv:1905.03337.
