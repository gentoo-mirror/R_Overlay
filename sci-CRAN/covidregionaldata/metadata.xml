		Subnational Data for the COVID-19 Outbreak // An interface to
		subnational and national level COVID-19 data. For all countries
		supported, this includes a daily time-series of cases.
		Wherever available we also provide data on deaths,
		hospitalisations, and tests.  National level data is also
		supported using a range of data sources as well as line list
		data and links to intervention data sets.
