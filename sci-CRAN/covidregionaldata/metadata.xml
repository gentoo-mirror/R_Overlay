		subnational and national level COVID-19 data sourced from both
		official sources, such as Public Health England in the UK, and
		from other COVID-19 data collections, including the World
		Health Organisation (WHO), European Centre for Disease
		Prevention and Control (ECDC), John Hopkins University (JHU),
		Google Open Data and others. Designed to streamline COVID-19
		data extraction, cleaning, and processing from a range of data
		sources in an open and transparent way. This allows users to
		inspect and scrutinise the data, and tools used to process it,
		at every step. For all countries supported, data includes a
		daily time-series of cases. Wherever available data is also
		provided for deaths, hospitalisations, and tests. National
		level data are also supported using a range of sources as well
		as line list data and links to intervention data sets.
