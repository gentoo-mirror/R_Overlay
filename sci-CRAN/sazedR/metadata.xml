		Parameter-Free Domain-Agnostic Season Length Detection in Time
		Series // Spectral and Average Autocorrelation Zero Distance
		Density ('sazed') is a method for estimating the season length
		of a seasonal time series. 'sazed' is aimed at practitioners,
		as it employs only domain-agnostic preprocessing and does not
		depend on parameter tuning or empirical constants. The
		computation of 'sazed' relies on the efficient autocorrelation
		computation methods suggested by Thibauld Nion (2012, URL:
		http://www.tibonihoo.net/literate_musing/autocorrelations.html)
		and by Bob Carpenter (2012, URL: https://lingpipe-
		blog.com/2012/06/08/autocorrelation-fft-kiss-eigen/).
