		Explore Probability Distributions for Bivariate Temporal
		Granularities // Provides tools for systematically exploring
		large quantities of temporal data across nonlinear temporal
		granularities (deconstructions of time) by visualizing
		probability distributions. Nonlinear time granularities can be
		circular, quasi-circular or aperiodic. 'gravitas' computes
		nonlinear single-order-up or multiple-order-up granularities,
		check the feasibility of creating plots for any two nonlinear
		granularities and recommend probability distributions plots for
		exploring periodicity in the data.
