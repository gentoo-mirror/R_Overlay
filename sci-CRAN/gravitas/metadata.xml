		Explore Probability Distributions for Bivariate Temporal
		Granularities // Provides tools for systematically exploring
		large quantities of temporal data across different temporal
		granularities (deconstructions of time) by visualizing
		probability distributions. 'gravitas' computes circular,
		aperiodic, single-order-up or multiple-order-up granularities
		and advises on which combinations of granularities to explore
		and through which distribution plots.
