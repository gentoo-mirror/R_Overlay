		Visualise Clusterings at Different Resolutions // Deciding what
		resolution to use can be a difficult question when approaching
		a clustering analysis. One way to approach this problem is to
		look at how samples move as the number of clusters increases.
		This package allows you to produce clustering trees, a
		visualisation for interrogating clusterings as resolution
		increases.
