		Flexible Data Simulation Using the Multivariate Normal
		Distribution // This R package can be used to generate
		artificial data conditionally on pre-specified (simulated or
		user-defined) relationships between the variables and/or
		observations. Each observation is drawn from a multivariate
		Normal distribution where the mean vector and covariance matrix
		reflect the desired relationships. Outputs can be used to
		evaluate the performances of variable selection, graphical
		modelling, or clustering approaches by comparing the true and
		estimated structures (B Bodinier et al (2021)
		arXiv:2106.02521).
