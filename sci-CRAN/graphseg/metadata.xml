		Segmentation of Graph-Based Signals // Perform segmentation of
		graph-based signals. Assume a noisy observation of a signal two
		values correspond to vertices on a graph. Assume the true value
		of the signal is piece-wise constant (where each 'piece' is a
		connected subgraph). The main function, agraph(), computes the
		segmentation of the signal. The package also includes a wrapper
		around the competing method flsa() (from package 'flsa'). More
		information about this method in Goepp and van de Kassteele
		(2022) "Graph-Based Spatial Segmentation of Health-Related
		Areal Data" doi:10.48550/arXiv.2206.06752.
