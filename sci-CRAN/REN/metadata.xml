		Regularization Ensemble for Robust Portfolio Optimization //
		Portfolio optimization is achieved through a combination of
		regularization techniques and ensemble methods that are
		designed to generate stable out-of-sample return predictions,
		particularly in the presence of strong correlations among
		assets. The package includes functions for data preparation,
		parallel processing, and portfolio analysis using methods such
		as Mean-Variance, James-Stein, LASSO, Ridge Regression, and
		Equal Weighting. It also provides visualization tools and
		performance metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, volatility, and
		maximum drawdown, to assess the results.
