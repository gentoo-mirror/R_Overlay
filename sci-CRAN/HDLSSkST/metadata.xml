		Distribution-Free Exact High Dimensional Low Sample Size k-Sample
		Tests // Testing homogeneity of k multivariate distributions is
		a classical and challenging problem in statistics, and this
		becomes even more challenging when the dimension of the data
		exceeds the sample size. We construct some tests for this
		purpose which are exact level (size) alpha tests based on
		clustering. These tests are easy to implement and distribution-
		free in finite sample situations. Under appropriate regularity
		conditions, these tests have the consistency property in HDLSS
		asymptotic regime, where the dimension of data grows to
		infinity while the sample size remains fixed. We also consider
		a multiscale approach, where the results for different number
		of partitions are aggregated judiciously. Details are in Biplab
