		Differential Gene Correlation Analysis // Performs differential
		correlation analysis on input matrices, with multiple
		conditions specified by a design matrix. Contains functions to
		filter, process, save, visualize, and interpret differential
		correlations of identifier-pairs across the entire identifier
		space, or with respect to a particular set of identifiers
		(e.g., one). Also contains several functions to perform
		differential correlation analysis on clusters (i.e., modules)
		or genes. Finally, it contains functions to generate empirical
		p-values for the hypothesis tests and adjust them for multiple
		comparisons. Although the package was built with gene
		expression data in mind, it is applicable to other types of
		genomics data as well, in addition to being potentially
		applicable to data from other fields entirely. It is described
		more fully in the manuscript introducing it, freely available
		at doi:10.1186/s12918-016-0349-1.
