		Easier Cluster Computing (Based on 'snow') // Usability wrapper
		around snow for easier development of parallel R programs. This
		package offers e.g. extended error checks, and additional
		functions. All functions work in sequential mode, too, if no
		cluster is present or wished. Package is also designed as
		connector to the cluster management tool sfCluster, but can
		also used without it.
