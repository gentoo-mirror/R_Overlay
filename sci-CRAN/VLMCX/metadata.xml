		Variable Length Markov Chain with Exogenous Covariates // Models
		categorical time series through a Markov Chain when a)
		covariates are predictors for transitioning into the next
		state/symbol and b) when the dependence in the past states has
		variable length. The probability of transitioning to the next
		state in the Markov Chain is defined by a multinomial
		regression whose parameters depend on the past states of the
		chain and, moreover, the number of states in the past needed to
		predict the next state also depends on the observed states
		themselves. See Zambom, Kim, and Garcia (2022)
