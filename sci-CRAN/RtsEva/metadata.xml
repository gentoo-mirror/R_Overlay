		Performs the Transformed-Stationary Extreme Values Analysis //
		Adaptation of the 'Matlab' 'tsEVA' toolbox developed by Lorenzo
		Mentaschi available here: https://github.com/menta78/tsEva. It
		contains an implementation of the Transformed-Stationary (TS)
		methodology for non-stationary extreme value Analysis (EVA) as
		described in Mentaschi et al. (2016)
		doi:10.5194/hess-20-3527-2016. In synthesis this approach
		consists in: (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into
		a stationary one to which the stationary extreme value theory
		can be applied; and (ii) reverse-transforming the result into a
		non-stationary extreme value distribution. 'RtsEva' offers
		several options for trend estimation (mean, extremes, seasonal)
		and contains multiple plotting functions displaying different
		aspects of the non-stationarity of extremes.
