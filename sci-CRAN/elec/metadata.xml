		Collection of Functions for Statistical Election Audits // This
		is a (somewhat bizarre) collection of functions written to do
		various sorts of statistical election audits.  There are also
		functions to generate simulated voting data, including methods
		to simulation different types of voting errors which allow for
		simulations for checking the characteristics of these methods.
