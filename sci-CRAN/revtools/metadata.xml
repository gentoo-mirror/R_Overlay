		Tools to Support Evidence Synthesis // Researchers commonly need
		to summarize scientific information, a process known as
		'evidence synthesis'. The first stage of a synthesis process
		(such as a systematic review or meta-analysis) is to download a
		list of references from academic search engines such as 'Web of
		Knowledge' or 'Scopus'. This information can be sorted manually
		(the traditional approach to systematic review), or the user
		can draw on tools from machine learning to help them visualise
		patterns in the corpus. 'revtools' uses topic models to render
		ordinations of text drawn from article titles, keywords and
		abstracts, and allows the user to interactively select or
		exclude individual references, words or topics. 'revtools' does
		not currently provide tools for analysis of data drawn from
		those references, features that are available in other packages
		such as 'metagear' or 'metafor'.
