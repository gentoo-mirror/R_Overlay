		Tools to Support Evidence Synthesis // Researchers commonly need
		to summarize scientific information, a process known as
		'evidence synthesis'. The first stage of a synthesis process
		(such as a systematic review or meta-analysis) is to download a
		list of references from academic search engines such as 'Web of
		Knowledge' or 'Scopus'. The traditional approach to systematic
		review is then to sort these data manually, first by locating
		and removing duplicated entries, and then screening to remove
		irrelevant content by viewing titles and abstracts (in that
		order). 'revtools' provides interfaces for each of these tasks.
		An alternative approach, however, is to draw on tools from
		machine learning to visualise patterns in the corpus. In this
		case, you can use 'revtools' to render ordinations of text
		drawn from article titles, keywords and abstracts, and
		interactively select or exclude individual references, words or
		topics.
