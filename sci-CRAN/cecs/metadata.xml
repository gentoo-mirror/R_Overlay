		R Interface for the C Implementation of CEC Benchmark Functions
		// Goal of this package is to provide access to benchmark
		functions defined for the Special Session and Competition on
		Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization in one place. The
		package contains functions from following years: 2013, 2014,
		2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 (https://github.com/P-N-Suganthan).
		Implementations of CEC-2013 (Y. Gonzalez-Fernandez  M.
		Zambrano-Bigiarini) and CEC2017 (D. Jagodziski) are taken from
		existed R packages. Also, the original C source code has been
		cleaned and reorganized for better readability.
