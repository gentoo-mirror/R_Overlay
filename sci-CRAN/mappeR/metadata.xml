		Construct and Visualize TDA Mapper Graphs // Topological data
		analysis (TDA) is a method of data analysis that uses
		techniques from topology to analyze high-dimensional data. Here
		we implement Mapper, an algorithm from this area developed by
		Singh, Mmoli and Carlsson (2007) which generalizes the concept
		of a Reeb graph https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeb_graph.
