		Creates Ideal Data for Generalized Linear Models // Have you ever
		struggled to find "good data" for a generalized linear model?
		Would you like to test how quickly statistics converge to
		parameters, or learn how picking different link functions
		affects model performance? This package creates ideal data for
		both common and novel generalized linear models so your
		questions can be empirically answered.
