		Individual Based Model Population Simulation // Simulation of the
		random evolution of structured population dynamics, called
		stochastic Individual Based Models (IBMs) (see e.g. Ferrire and
		Tran (2009) doi:10.1051/proc/2009033, Bansaye and Mlard (2015)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-21711-6, Boumezoued (2016)). The package
		allows users to simulate the random evolution of a population
		in which individuals are characterised by their date of birth,
		a set of attributes, and their potential date of death.
