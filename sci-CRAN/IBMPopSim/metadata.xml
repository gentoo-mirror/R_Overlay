		Individual Based Model Population Simulation // Simulation of the
		random evolution of heterogeneous populations using stochastic
		Individual-Based Models (IBMs) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2303.06183.
		The package enables users to simulate population evolution, in
		which individuals are characterized by their age and some
		characteristics, and the population is modified by different
		types of events, including births/arrivals, death/exit events,
		or changes of characteristics. The frequency at which an event
		can occur to an individual can depend on their age and
		characteristics, but also on the characteristics of other
		individuals (interactions). Such models have a wide range of
		applications. For instance, IBMs can be used for simulating the
		evolution of a heterogeneous insurance portfolio with selection
		or for validating  mortality forecasts. This package overcomes
		the limitations of time-consuming IBMs simulations by
		implementing new efficient algorithms  based on thinning
		methods, which are compiled using the 'Rcpp' package while
		providing a user-friendly interface.
