		Partitioning of Individual Autozygosity into Multiple Homozygous-
		by-Descent Classes // Functions to identify Homozygous-by-
		Descent (HBD) segments associated with runs of homozygosity
		(ROH) and to estimate individual autozygosity (or inbreeding
		coefficient). HBD segments and autozygosity are assigned to
		multiple HBD classes with a model-based approach relying on a
		mixture of exponential distributions. The rate of the
		exponential distribution is distinct for each HBD class and
		defines the expected length of the HBD segments. These HBD
		classes are therefore related to the age of the segments
		(longer segments and smaller rates for recent autozygosity /
		recent common ancestor). The functions allow to estimate the
		parameters of the model (rates of the exponential
		distributions, mixing proportions), to estimate global and
		local autozygosity probabilities and to identify HBD segments
		with the Viterbi decoding. The method is fully described in
		Druet and Gautier (2017) doi:10.1111/mec.14324 and Druet and
		Gautier (2022) doi:10.1016/j.tpb.2022.03.001.
