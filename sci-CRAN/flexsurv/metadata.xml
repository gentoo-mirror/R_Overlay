		Flexible Parametric Survival and Multi-State Models // Flexible
		parametric models for time-to-event data, including the
		Royston-Parmar spline model, generalized gamma and generalized
		F distributions.  Any user-defined parametric distribution can
		be fitted, given at least an R function defining the
		probability density or hazard. There are also tools for fitting
		and predicting from fully parametric multi-state models.
