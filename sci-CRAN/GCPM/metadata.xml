		Generalized Credit Portfolio Model // Analyze the default risk of
		credit portfolios. Commonly known models, like CreditRisk+ or
		the CreditMetrics model are implemented in their very basic
		settings. The portfolio loss distribution can be achieved
		either by simulation or analytically in case of the classic
		CreditRisk+ model. Models are only implemented to respect
		losses caused by defaults, i.e. migration risk is not included.
		The package structure is kept flexible especially with respect
		to distributional assumptions in order to quantify the
		sensitivity of risk figures with respect to several
		assumptions. Therefore the package can be used to determine the
		credit risk of a given portfolio as well as to quantify model
		sensitivities.
