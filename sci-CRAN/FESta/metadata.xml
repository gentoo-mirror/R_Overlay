		Fishing Effort Standardisation // Original idea was presented in
		the reference paper. Varghese et al. (2020, 74(1):35-42)
		"Bayesian State-space Implementation of Schaefer Production
		Model for Assessment of Stock Status for Multi-gear Fishery".
		Marine fisheries governance and management practices are very
		essential to ensure the sustainability of the marine resources.
		A widely accepted resource management strategy towards this is
		to derive sustainable fish harvest levels based on the status
		of marine fish stock. Various fish stock assessment models that
		describe the biomass dynamics using time series data on fish
		catch and fishing effort are generally used for this purpose.
		In the scenario of complex multi-species marine fishery in
		which different species are caught by a number of fishing gears
		and each gear harvests a number of species make it difficult to
		obtain the fishing effort corresponding to each fish species.
		Since the capacity of the gears varies, the effort made to
		catch a resource cannot be considered as the sum of efforts
		expended by different fishing gears. This necessitates
		standardisation of fishing effort in unit base.
