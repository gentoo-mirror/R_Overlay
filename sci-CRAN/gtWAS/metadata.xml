		Genome and Transcriptome Wide Association Study // Quantitative
		trait loci mapping and genome wide association analysis are
		used to find candidate molecular marker or region associated
		with phenotype based on linkage analysis and linkage
		disequilibrium. Gene expression quantitative trait loci mapping
		is used to find candidate molecular marker or region associated
		with gene expression. In this package, we applied the method in
		Liu W. (2011) doi:10.1007/s00122-011-1631-7 and Gusev A. (2016)
		doi:10.1038/ng.3506 to genome and transcriptome wide
		association study, which is aimed at revealing the association
		relationship between phenotype and molecular markers,
		expression levels, molecular markers nested within different
		related expression effect and expression effect nested within
		different related molecular marker effect. F test based on full
		and reduced model are performed to obtain p value or likelihood
		ratio statistic. The best linear model can be obtained by
		stepwise regression analysis.
