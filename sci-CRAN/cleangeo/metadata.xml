		Cleaning Geometries from Spatial Objects // Provides a set of
		utility tools to inspect spatial objects, facilitate handling
		and reporting of topology errors and geometry validity issue
		with sp objects. Finally, it provides a geometry cleaner that
		will fix all geometry problems, and eliminate (at least reduce)
		the likelihood of having issues when doing spatial data
		processing.
