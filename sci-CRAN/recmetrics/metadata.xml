		Psychometric Evaluation Using Relative Excess Correlations //
		Modern results of psychometric theory are implemented to
		provide users with a way of evaluating the internal structure
		of a set of items guided by theory. These methods are discussed
		in detail in VanderWeele and Padgett (2024)
		doi:10.31234/osf.io/rnbk5. The relative excess correlation
		matrices will, generally, have numerous negative entries even
		if all of the raw correlations between each pair of indicators
		are positive. The positive deviations of the relative excess
		correlation matrix entries help identify clusters of indicators
		that are more strongly related to one another, providing
		insights somewhat analogous to factor analysis, but without the
		need for rotations or decisions concerning the number of
		factors. A goal similar to exploratory/confirmatory factor
		analysis, but 'recmetrics' uses novel methods that do not rely
		on assumptions of latent variables or latent variable
		structures.
