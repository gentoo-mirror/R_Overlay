		Information Assessment for Individual Modalities in Multimodal
		Regression Models // Provides methods for quantifying the
		information gain contributed by individual modalities in
		multimodal regression models. Information gain is measured
		using Expected Relative Entropy (ERE) or pseudo-R metrics, with
		corresponding p-values and confidence intervals. Currently
		supports linear and logistic regression models with plans for
		extension to additional Generalized Linear Models and Cox
		proportional hazard model.
