		Zero-Inflated Beta-Binomial Modeling of Microbiome Count Data //
		Microbiome count data (Operational Taxonomic Unit, OTUs) is
		usually overdispersed and has excessive zero counts. The
		'ZIBBSeqDiscovery' assumes a zero-inflated beta-binomial model
		for the distribution of the count data, and employes link
		functions to adjust interested covariates. To fit the model,
		two approaches are proposed (i) a free approach which treats
		the overdispersion parameters for OTUs as independent, and (ii)
		a constrained approach which proposes a mean-overdispersion
		relationship to the count data. This package can be used to
		test the association between the composition of the microbiome
		counts and the interested covariates.
