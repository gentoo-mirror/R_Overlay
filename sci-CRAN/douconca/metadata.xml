		Double Constrained Correspondence Analysis for Trait-Environment
		Analysis in Ecology // Double constrained correspondence
		analysis (dc-CA) analyzes (multi-)trait (multi-)environment
		ecological data by using the 'vegan' package and native R code.
		Throughout the two step algorithm of ter Braak et al. (2018) is
		used. This algorithm combines and extends community- (sample-)
		and species-level analyses, i.e. the usual community weighted
		means (CWM)-based regression analysis and the species-level
		analysis of species-niche centroids (SNC)-based regression
		analysis. The two steps use canonical correspondence analysis
		to regress the abundance data on to the traits and (weighted)
		redundancy analysis to regress the CWM of the orthonormalized
		traits on to the environmental predictors. The function dc_CA()
		has an option to divide the abundance data of a site by the
		site total, giving equal site weights. This division has the
		advantage that the multivariate analysis corresponds with an
		unweighted (multi-trait) community-level analysis, instead of
		being weighted. The first step of the algorithm uses
		vegan::cca(). The second step uses wrda() but vegan::rda() if
		the site weights are equal. This version has a predict()
		function. For details see ter Braak et al. 2018
