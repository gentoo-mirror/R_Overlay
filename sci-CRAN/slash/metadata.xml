		Path-Based Access and Manipulation of Nested Lists // Allows
		users to list data structures using path-based navigation.
		Provides intuitive methods for storing, accessing, and
		manipulating nested data through simple path strings. Key
		features include strict mode validation, path existence
		checking, recursive operations, and automatic parent-level
		creation. Designed for use cases requiring organized storage of
		complex nested data while maintaining simple access patterns.
		Particularly useful for configuration management, nested
		settings, and any application where data naturally forms a
		tree-like structure.
