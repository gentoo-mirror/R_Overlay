		Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction // Provides tools to
		implement both unsupervised and supervised nonlinear dimension
		reduction methods. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Sliced
		Inverse Regression (SIR), and Sliced Average Variance
		Estimation (SAVE) are useful methods to reduce the
		dimensionality of covariates. However, they produce linear
		combinations of covariates. Kernel PCA, generalized SIR, and
		generalized SAVE address this problem by extending the
		applicability of the dimension reduction problem to nonlinear
		settings. This package includes a comprehensive algorithm for
		kernel PCA, generalized SIR, and generalized SAVE, including
		methods for choosing tuning parameters and some essential
		functions. The algorithms for this package is from Li (2018,
		ISBN:9780367734725).
