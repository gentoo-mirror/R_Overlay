		Automated and Early Detection of Disease Outbreaks // A powerful
		tool for automating the early detection of disease outbreaks in
		time series data. 'aeddo' employs advanced statistical methods,
		including hierarchical models, in an innovative manner to
		effectively characterize outbreak signals. It is particularly
		useful for epidemiologists, public health professionals, and
		researchers seeking to identify and respond to disease
		outbreaks in a timely fashion. For a detailed reference on
		hierarchical models, consult Henrik Madsen and Poul Thyregod's
		book (2011), ISBN: 9781420091557.
