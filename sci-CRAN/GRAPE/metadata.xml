		Gene-Ranking Analysis of Pathway Expression // Gene-Ranking
		Analysis of Pathway Expression (GRAPE) is a tool for
		summarizing the consensus behavior of biological pathways in
		the form of a template, and for quantifying the extent to which
		individual samples deviate from the template. GRAPE templates
		are based only on the relative rankings of the genes within the
		pathway and can be used for classification of tissue types or
		disease subtypes. GRAPE can be used to represent gene-
		expression samples as vectors of pathway scores, where each
		pathway score indicates the departure from a given collection
		of reference samples. The resulting pathway- space
		representation can be used as the feature set for various
		applications, including survival analysis and drug-response
		prediction. Users of GRAPE should use the following citation:
		Klein MI, Stern DF, and Zhao H. GRAPE: A pathway template
		method to characterize tissue-specific functionality from gene
		expression profiles. BMC Bioinformatics, 18:317 (June 2017).
