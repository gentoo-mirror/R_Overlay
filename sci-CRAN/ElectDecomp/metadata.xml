		Decomposition of Seats-to-Votes Distortion in Multimember
		Elections // Decomposes the seat-to-vote distortion for every
		party (individual party bias or individual party deviation from
		proportional representation) into segments that can be
		attributed to separate causes for the party infra or over-
		representation: the electoral system effect (separating the
		mean and the variance effect within it) and the population
		effect (separating malapportionment and unequal participation
		effect within it).   It works on (single tired) districted
		electoral systems with any number of seats per district. In
		addition, the package aggregates the individual party
		distortion into an index of deviation from proportionality (the
		Losemore-Hanby  index) whose value is also decomposed into
		segments attributed to the major causes of deviation from
		proportionality (plus the interactions among them).
