		Assessing Normality of Stationary Process // Despite that several
		tests for normality in stationary processes have been proposed
		in the literature, consistent implementations of these tests in
		programming languages are limited. Four normality test are
		implemented. The Lobato and Velasco's, Epps, Psaradakis and
		Vavra, and the random projections tests for stationary process.
		Some other diagnostics such as, unit root test for
		stationarity, seasonal tests for seasonality, and arch effect
		test for volatility; are also performed. The package also
		offers residual diagnostic for linear time series models
		developed in several packages.
