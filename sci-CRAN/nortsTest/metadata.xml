		Assessing Normality of Stationary Process // Despite that several
		tests for normality in stationary processes have been proposed
		in the literature, consistent implementations of these tests in
		programming languages are limited. Seven normality test are
		implemented. The asymptotic Lobato  Velasco's, asymptotic Epps,
		Psaradakis and  Vvra, Lobato  Velasco's and Epps sieve
		bootstrap approximations, El bouch et al., and the random
		projections tests for univariate stationary process. Some other
		diagnostics such as, unit root test for  stationarity, seasonal
		tests for seasonality, and arch effect test for volatility; are
		also performed. Additionally, the El bouch test performs
		normality tests for bivariate time series. The package also
		offers residual diagnostic for linear time series models
		developed in several packages.
