		True Random Numbers using the ANU Quantum Random Numbers Server
		// The ANU Quantum Random Number Generator provided by the
		Australian National University generates true random numbers in
		real-time by measuring the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.
		This package offers an interface using their API. The
		electromagnetic field of the vacuum exhibits random
		fluctuations in phase and amplitude at all frequencies. By
		carefully measuring these fluctuations, one is able to generate
		ultra-high bandwidth random numbers. The quantum Random Number
		Generator is based on the papers by Symul et al., (2011)
		doi:10.1063/1.3597793 and Haw, et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.054004. The package offers
		functions to retrieve a sequence of random integers or
		hexadecimals and true random samples from a normal or uniform
		distribution.
