		Cellwise Robust M-Regression and SPADIMO // Method for fitting a
		cellwise robust linear M-regression model (CRM, Filzmoser et
		al. (2020) DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2020.106944) that yields both a
		map of cellwise outliers consistent with the linear model, and
		a vector of regression coefficients that is robust against
		vertical outliers and leverage points. As a by-product, the
		method yields an imputed data set that contains estimates of
		what the values in cellwise outliers would need to amount to if
		they had fit the model. The package also provides diagnostic
		tools for analyzing casewise and cellwise outliers using sparse
		directions of maximal outlyingness (SPADIMO, Debruyne et al.
		(2019) DOI:10.1007/s11222-018-9831-5).
