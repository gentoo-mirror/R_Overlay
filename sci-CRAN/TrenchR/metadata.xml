		Tools for Microclimate and Biophysical Ecology // Tools for
		translating environmental change into organismal response.
		Microclimate models to vertically scale weather station data to
		organismal heights. The biophysical modeling tools include both
		general models for heat flows and specific models to predict
		body temperatures for a variety of ectothermic taxa. Additional
		functions model and temporally partition air and soil
		temperatures and solar radiation. Utility functions estimate
		the organismal and environmental parameters needed for
		biophysical ecology. 'TrenchR' focuses on relatively simple and
		modular functions so users can create transparent and flexible
		biophysical models. Many functions are derived from Gates
