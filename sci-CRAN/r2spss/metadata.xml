		Format R Output to Look Like SPSS // Create plots and LaTeX
		tables that look like SPSS output for use in teaching
		materials.  Rather than copying-and-pasting SPSS output into
		documents, R code that mocks up SPSS output can be integrated
		directly into dynamic LaTeX documents with tools such as knitr.
		Functionality includes methods that are typically covered in
		introductory statistics classes: descriptive statistics, common
		hypothesis tests, ANOVA, and linear regression, as well as
		boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, and line plots (including
		profile plots).
