		Semi-Parametric Gene-Environment Interaction via Bayesian
		Variable Selection // Many complex diseases are known to be
		affected by the interactions between genetic variants and
		environmental exposures beyond the main genetic and
		environmental effects. Existing Bayesian methods for gene-
		environment (GE) interaction studies are challenged by the
		high-dimensional nature of the study and the complexity of
		environmental influences. We have developed a novel and
		powerful semi-parametric Bayesian variable selection method
		that can accommodate linear and nonlinear GE interactions
		simultaneously (Ren et al. (2019) arXiv:1906.01057).
		Furthermore, the proposed method can conduct structural
		identification by distinguishing nonlinear interactions from
		main effects only case within Bayesian framework. Spike-and-
		slab priors are incorporated on both individual and group level
		to shrink coefficients corresponding to irrelevant main and
		interaction effects to zero exactly. The Markov chain Monte
		Carlo algorithms of the proposed and alternative methods are
		efficiently implemented in C++.
