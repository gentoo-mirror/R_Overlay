		Processing of Point Clouds Derived from Terrestrial Laser
		Scanning // A set of tools to process and calculate metrics on
		point clouds derived from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) also
		know as terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Its
		creation is based on key aspects of the TLS application in
		forestry and ecology. Currently, the main routines are based on
		filtering, neighboring features of points, voxelization, canopy
		structure, and the creation of artificial stands. It is written
		using data.table and 'C++' language and in most of the
		functions it is possible to use parallel processing to speed-up
		the routines.
