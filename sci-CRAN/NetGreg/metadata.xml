		Network-Guided Penalized Regression (NetGreg) // A network-guided
		penalized regression framework that integrates network
		characteristics from Gaussian graphical models with partial
		penalization, accounting for both network structure (hubs and
		non-hubs) and clinical covariates in high-dimensional omics
		data, including transcriptomics and proteomics. The full
		methodological details can be found in our recent preprint by
		Ahn S and Oh EJ (2025) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.22986.
