		Learning Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms // Classical
		hierarchical clustering algorithms, agglomerative and divisive
		clustering. Algorithms are implemented as a theoretical way,
		step by step. It includes some detailed functions that explain
		each step. Every function allows options to get different
		results using different techniques. The package explains non
		expert users how hierarchical clustering algorithms work.
