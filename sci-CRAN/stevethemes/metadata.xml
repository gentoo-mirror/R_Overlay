		Steve's 'ggplot2' Themes and Related Theme Elements // This is a
		compilation of my preferred themes and related theme elements
		for 'ggplot2'. I believe these themes and theme elements are
		aesthetically pleasing, both for pedagogical instruction and
		for the presentation of applied statistical research to a wide
		audience. These themes imply routine use of easily
		obtained/free fonts, simple forms of which are included in this
		package.
