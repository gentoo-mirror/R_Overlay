		Selected Utilities Extending 'ggplot2' // Selected utilities, in
		particular 'geoms' and 'stats' functions, extending the
		'ggplot2' package. Note that this package does not define the
		functions itself, but instead imports them from a collection of
		other packages and then exports them. These functions are
		tested as well to make sure that they work reliably. Currently,
		the selected functions are from 'EnvStats'
