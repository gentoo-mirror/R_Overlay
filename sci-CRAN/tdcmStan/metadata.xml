		Automating the Creation of Stan Code for TDCMs // A collection of
		functions for automatically creating 'Stan' code for transition
		diagnostic classification models (TDCMs) as they are defined by
		Madison and Bradshaw (2018) DOI:10.1007/s11336-018-9638-5. This
		package supports automating the creation of 'Stan' code for
		TDCMs, fungible TDCMs (i.e., TDCMs with item parameters
		constrained to be equal across all items), and multi-threaded
		TDCMs.
