		Spectral Modularity Clustering // Implements the network
		clustering algorithm described in Newman (2006)
		doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.74.036104. The complete iterative
		algorithm comprises of two steps. In the first step, the
		network is expressed in terms of its leading eigenvalue and
		eigenvector and recursively partition into two communities.
		Partitioning occurs if the maximum positive eigenvalue is
		greater than the tolerance (10e-5) for the current partition,
		and if it results in a positive contribution to the Modularity.
		Given an initial separation using the leading eigen step,
		'rSpectral' then continues to maximise for the change in
		Modularity using a fine-tuning step - or variate thereof. The
		first stage here is to find the node which, when moved from one
		community to another, gives the maximum change in Modularity.
		This nodes community is then fixed and we repeat the process
		until all nodes have been moved. The whole process is repeated
		from this new state until the change in the Modularity, between
		the new and old state, is less than the predefined tolerance. A
		slight variant of the fine-tuning step, which can improve speed
		of the calculation, is also provided. Instead of moving each
		node into each community in turn, we only consider moves of
		neighbouring nodes, found in different communities, to the
		community of the current node of interest. The two steps
		process is repeatedly applied to each new community found,
		subdivided each community into two new communities, until we
		are unable to find any division that results in a positive
		change in Modularity.
