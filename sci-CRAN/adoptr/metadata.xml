		Adaptive Optimal Two-Stage Designs in R // Optimize one or two-
		arm, two-stage designs for clinical trials with respect to
		several pre-implemented objective criteria or implement custom
		objectives. Optimization under uncertainty and conditional
		(given stage-one outcome) constraints are supported. See Pilz
		M, Kunzmann K, Herrmann C, Rauch G, Kieser M. A variational
		approach to optimal two-stage designs. Statistics in Medicine.
