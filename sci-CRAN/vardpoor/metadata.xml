		Variance Estimation for Sample Surveys by the Ultimate Cluster
		Method // Generation of domain variables, linearization of
		several non-linear population statistics (the ratio of two
		totals, weighted income percentile, relative median income
		ratio, at-risk-of-poverty rate, at-risk-of-poverty threshold,
		Gini coefficient, gender pay gap, the aggregate replacement
		ratio, the relative median income ratio, median income below
		at-risk-of-poverty gap, income quintile share ratio, relative
		median at-risk-of-poverty gap), computation of regression
		residuals in case of weight calibration, variance estimation of
		sample surveys by the ultimate cluster method (Hansen, Hurwitz
		and Madow, Sample Survey Methods And Theory, vol. I: Methods
		and Applications; vol. II: Theory. 1953, New York: John Wiley
		and Sons), variance estimation for longitudinal, cross-
		sectional measures and measures of change for single and
		multistage stage cluster sampling designs (Berger, Y. G., 2015,
		doi:10.1111/rssa.12116). Several other precision measures are
		derived - standard error, the coefficient of variation, the
		margin of error, confidence interval, design effect.
