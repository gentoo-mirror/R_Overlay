		Variance Estimation for Sample Surveys by the Ultimate Cluster
		Method // Generation of domain variables, linearisation of
		several nonlinear population statistics (the ratio of two
		totals, weighted income percentile,  relative median income
		ratio, at-risk-of-poverty rate, at-risk-of-poverty threshold,
		Gini coefficient, gender pay gap, the aggregate replacement
		ratio, the relative median income ratio, median income below
		at-risk-of-poverty gap, income quintile share ratio, relative
		median at-risk-of-poverty gap),  computation of regression
		residuals in case of weight calibration, variance estimation of
		sample surveys by the ultimate cluster method (Hansen, Hurwitz
		and Madow,Theory, vol. I: Methods and Applications; vol. II:
		Theory.  1953,  New York: John Wiley and Sons), variance
		estimation for longitudinal, cross-sectional measures and
		measures of change for single and multistage stage cluster
		sampling designs (Berger, Y. G., 2015, doi:10.1111/rssa.12116).
		Several other precision measures are derived - standard error,
		the coefficient of variation, the margin of error, confidence
		interval, design effect.
