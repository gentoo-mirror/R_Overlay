		Mutational Signature Analysis Tools // Utility functions for
		mutational signature analysis. This package provides two groups
		of functions. One is for dealing with mutational signature
		"exposures" (i.e. the counts of mutations in a sample that are
		due to each mutational signature). The other group of functions
		is for matching two sets of mutational signatures. The match
		minimizes the total distance between paired signatures by using
		the "Hungarian algorithm" described in : Kuhn, H. W. (1955)
		doi:10.1002/nav.3800020109. 'mSigTools' stands for mutational
		Signature analysis Tools.
