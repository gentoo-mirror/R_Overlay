		Mutational Signature Analysis Tools // Utility functions for
		mutational signature analysis as described in Alexandrov, L. B.
		(2020) doi:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3. This package provides two
		groups of functions. One is for dealing with mutational
		signature "exposures" (i.e. the counts of mutations in a sample
		that are due to each mutational signature). The other group of
		functions is for matching or comparing sets of mutational
		signatures. 'mSigTools' stands for mutational Signature
		analysis Tools.
