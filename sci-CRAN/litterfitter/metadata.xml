		Fit a Collection of Curves to Single Cohort Decomposition Data //
		There is a long tradition of studying the flux of carbon from
		the biosphere to the atmosphere by following a particular
		cohort of litter (wood, leaves, roots, or other organic
		material) through time.  The resulting data are mass remaining
		and time. A variety of functional forms may be used to fit the
		resulting data. Some work better empirically. Some are better
		connected to a process-based understanding.  Some have a small
		number of free parameters; others have more. This package
		matches decomposition data to a family of these curves using
		likelihood--based fitting. This package is based on published
		research by Cornwell  Weedon (2013)
