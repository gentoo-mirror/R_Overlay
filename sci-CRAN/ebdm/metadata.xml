		Implementation of Estimating Binary Dependency from Marginal Data
		// Provides a maximum likelihood estimation method to recover
		the joint distribution of two binary variables using only
		marginal summary data from multiple studies. This approach
		allows for privacy-preserving estimation in settings where
		individual-level data are unavailable. The method is fully
		described in the manuscript by Shang, Tsao and Zhang (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.03995: "Estimating the Joint
		Distribution of Two Binary Variables from Their Marginal
		Summaries".
