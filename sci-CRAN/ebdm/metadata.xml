		Estimating Bivariate Dependency from Marginal Data // Provides
		maximum likelihood methods to estimate bivariate dependency
		(correlation) from marginal summary statistics in multi-study
		settings. The package supports both binary and continuous
		variables assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution,
		enabling privacy-preserving joint estimation when individual-
		level data are unavailable. The binary method is fully
		described in the manuscript by Shang, Tsao and Zhang (2025)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.03995: "Estimating the Joint
		Distribution of Two Binary Variables from Their Marginal
		Summaries".
