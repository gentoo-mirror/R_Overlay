		R Graphics Device using Cairo Graphics Library for Creating High-
		Quality Bitmap (PNG, JPEG, TIFF), Vector (PDF, SVG, PostScript)
		and Display (X11 and Win32) Output // R graphics device using
		cairographics library that can be used to create high-quality
		vector (PDF, PostScript and SVG) and bitmap output
		(PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality rendering in displays (X11
		and Win32). Since it uses the same back-end for all output,
		copying across formats is WYSIWYG. Files are created without
		the dependence on X11 or other external programs. This device
		supports alpha channel (semi-transparent drawing) and resulting
		images can contain transparent and semi-transparent regions. It
		is ideal for use in server environments (file output) and as a
		replacement for other devices that don't have Cairo's
		capabilities such as alpha support or anti-aliasing. Backends
		are modular such that any subset of backends is supported.
