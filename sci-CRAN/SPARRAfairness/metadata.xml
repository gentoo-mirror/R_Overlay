		Analysis of Differential Behaviour of SPARRA Score Across
		Demographic Groups // The SPARRA risk score (Scottish Patients
		At Risk of admission and Re-Admission) estimates yearly risk of
		emergency hospital admission using electronic health records on
		a monthly basis for most of the Scottish population. This
		package implements a suite of functions used to analyse the
		behaviour and performance of the score, focusing particularly
		on differential performance over demographically-defined
		groups. It includes useful utility functions to plot receiver-
		operator-characteristic, precision-recall and calibration
		curves, draw stock human figures, estimate counterfactual
		quantities without the need to re-compute risk scores, to
		simulate a semi-realistic dataset. Our manuscript can be found
		at: doi:10.1371/journal.pdig.0000675.
