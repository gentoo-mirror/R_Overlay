		Curve Registration for Exponential Family Functional Data // A
		method for performing joint registration and functional
		principal component analysis for curves (functional data) that
		are generated from exponential family distributions. This
		mainly implements the algorithms described in 'Wrobel et al.
		(2019)' doi:10.1111/biom.12963 and further adapts them to
		potentially incomplete curves where (some) curves are not
		observed from the beginning and/or until the end of the common
		domain. Curve registration can be used to better understand
		patterns in functional data by separating curves into phase and
		amplitude variability. This software handles both binary and
		continuous functional data, and is especially applicable in
		accelerometry and wearable technology.
