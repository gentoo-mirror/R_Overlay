		Curve Registration for Exponential Family Functional Data // A
		method for registering curves (functional data) that are
		generated from exponential family distributions.  This
		implements the algorithms described in 'Wrobel et al. (2019)'
		doi:10.1111/biom.12963. Curve registration is an active area of
		research in functional data analysis, and can be used to better
		understand patterns in functional data by separating curves
		into phase and amplitude variability. This software handles
		both binary and continuous functional data, and is especially
		applicable in accelerometry and wearable technology.
