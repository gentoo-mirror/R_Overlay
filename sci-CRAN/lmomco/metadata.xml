		L-Moments, Censored L-Moments, Trimmed L-Moments, L-Comoments,
		and Many Distributions // Extensive functions for Lmoments
		(LMs) and probability-weighted moments (PWMs), distribution
		parameter estimation, LMs for distributions, LM ratio diagrams,
		multivariate Lcomoments, and asymmetric (asy) trimmed LMs
		(TLMs). Maximum likelihood and maximum product spacings
		estimation are available. Right-tail and left-tail LM censoring
		by threshold or indicator variable are available. LMs of
		residual (resid) and reversed (rev) residual life are
		implemented along with 13 quantile operators for reliability
		analyses. Exact analytical bootstrap estimates of order
		statistics, LMs, and LM var-covars are available. Harri-Coble
		Tau34-squared Normality Test is available. Distributions with
		L, TL, and added (+) support for right-tail censoring (RC)
		encompass: Asy Exponential (Exp) Power [L], Asy Triangular [L],
		Cauchy [TL], Eta-Mu [L], Exp. [L], Gamma [L], Generalized (Gen)
		Exp Poisson [L], Gen Extreme Value [L], Gen Lambda [L, TL], Gen
		Logistic [L], Gen Normal [L], Gen Pareto [L+RC, TL],
		Govindarajulu [L], Gumbel [L], Kappa [L], Kappa-Mu [L],
		Kumaraswamy [L], Laplace [L], Linear Mean Residual Quantile
		Function [L], Normal [L], 3p log-Normal [L], Pearson Type III
		[L], Polynomial Density-Quantile 3 and 4 [L], Rayleigh [L],
		Rev-Gumbel [L+RC], Rice [L], Singh Maddala [L], Slash [TL], 3p
		Student t [L], Truncated Exponential [L], Wakeby [L], and
		Weibull [L].
