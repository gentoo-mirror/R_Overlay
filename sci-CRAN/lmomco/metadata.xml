		L-Moments, Censored L-Moments, Trimmed L-Moments, L-Comoments,
		and Many Distributions // Extensive functions for L-moments
		(LMs) and probability-weighted moments (PWMs), parameter
		estimation for distributions, LM computation for distributions,
		and L-moment ratio diagrams. Maximum likelihood and maximum
		product of spacings estimation are also available. LMs for
		right-tail and left-tail censoring by known or unknown
		threshold and by indicator variable are available. Asymmetric
		(asy.) trimmed LMs (TL-moments, TLMs) are supported. LMs of
		residual (resid.) and reversed (rev.) resid. life are
		implemented along with 13 quantile function operators for
		reliability and survival analyses.  Exact analytical bootstrap
		estimates of order statistics, LMs, and variances-covariances
		of LMs are provided. The Harri-Coble Tau34-squared Normality
		Test is available. Distribution support with "L" (LMs), "TL"
		(TLMs) and added (+) support for right-tail censoring (RC)
		encompasses: Asy. Exponential (Exp.) Power [L], Asy. Triangular
		[L], Cauchy [TL], Eta-Mu [L], Exp. [L], Gamma [L], Generalized
		(Gen.) Exp. Poisson [L], Gen. Extreme Value [L], Gen. Lambda
		[L,TL], Gen. Logistic [L), Gen. Normal [L], Gen. Pareto [L+RC,
		TL], Govindarajulu [L], Gumbel [L], Kappa [L], Kappa-Mu [L],
		Kumaraswamy [L], Laplace [L], Linear Mean Resid. Quantile
		Function [L], Normal [L], 3-p log-Normal [L], Pearson Type III
		[L], Rayleigh [L], Rev.-Gumbel [L+RC], Rice/Rician [L], Slash
		[TL], 3-p Student t [L], Truncated Exponential [L], Wakeby [L],
		and Weibull [L]. Multivariate sample L-comoments (LCMs) are
		implemented to measure asymmetric association.
