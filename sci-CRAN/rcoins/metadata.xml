		Identify Naturally Continuous Lines in a Spatial Network //
		Provides functionality to group lines that form naturally
		continuous lines in a spatial network. The algorithm
		implemented is based on the Continuity in Street Networks
		(COINS) method from Tripathy et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1177/2399808320967680, which identifies continuous
		"strokes" in the network as the line strings that maximize the
		angles between consecutive segments.
