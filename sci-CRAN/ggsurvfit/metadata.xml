		Flexible Time-to-Event Figures // Ease the creation of time-to-
		event (i.e. survival) endpoint figures. The modular functions
		create figures ready for publication. Each of the functions
		that add to or modify the figure are written as proper
		'ggplot2' geoms or stat methods, allowing the functions from
		this package to be combined with any function or customization
		from 'ggplot2' and other 'ggplot2' extension packages.
