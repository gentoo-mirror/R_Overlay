		Compute Upper Prediction Bounds on the FDP in Competition-Based
		Setups // Implements functions that calculate upper prediction
		bounds on the false discovery proportion (FDP) in the list of
		discoveries returned by competition-based setups, implementing
		Ebadi et al. (2022) arXiv:2302.11837. Such setups include
		target-decoy competition (TDC) in computational mass
		spectrometry and the knockoff construction in linear regression
		(note this package typically uses the terminology of TDC).
		Included is the standardized (TDC-SB) and uniform (TDC-UB)
		bound on TDC's FDP, and the simultaneous standardized and
		uniform bands. Requires pre-computed Monte Carlo statistics
		available at https://github.com/uni-Arya/fdpbandsdata. This
		data can be downloaded by running the command
		'devtools::install_github("uni-Arya/fdpbandsdata")' in R and
		restarting R after installation. The size of this data is
		roughly 81Mb.
