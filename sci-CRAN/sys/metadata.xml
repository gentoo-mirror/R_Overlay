		Powerful and Reliable Tools for Running System Commands in R //
		Drop-in replacements for the base system2() function with fine
		control and consistent behavior across platforms. Supports
		clean interruption, timeout, background tasks, and streaming
		STDIN / STDOUT / STDERR over binary or text connections.
		Arguments on Windows automatically get encoded and quoted to
		work on different locales. On Unix platforms the package also
		provides functions for evaluating expressions inside a
		temporary fork. Such evaluations have no side effects on the
		main R process, and support reliable interrupts and timeouts.
		This provides the basis for a sandboxing mechanism.
