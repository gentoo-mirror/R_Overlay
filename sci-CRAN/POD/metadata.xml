		Probability of Detection for Qualitative PCR Methods // This tool
		computes the probability of detection (POD) curve and the limit
		of detection (LOD), i.e. the number of copies of the target DNA
		sequence required to ensure a 95 % probability of detection
		(LOD95). Other quantiles of the LOD can be specified. This is a
		reimplementation of the mathematical-statistical modelling of
		the validation of qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
		methods within a single laboratory as provided by the
		commercial tool 'PROLab' http://quodata.de/. The modelling
		itself has been described by Uhlig et al. (2015)
