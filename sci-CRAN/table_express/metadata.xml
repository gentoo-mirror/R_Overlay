		Building 'data.table' Expressions with Data Manipulation Verbs //
		A specialization of 'dplyr' data manipulation verbs that parse
		and build expressions which are ultimately evaluated by
		'data.table', letting it handle all optimizations. A set of
		additional verbs are also provided to facilitate some common
		operations on a subset of the data.
