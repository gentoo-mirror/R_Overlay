		Estimating Climate Stability from Climate Model Data // Climate
		stability measures are not formalized in the literature and
		tools for generating stability metrics from existing data are
		nascent. This package provides tools for calculating climate
		stability from raster data encapsulating climate change as a
		series of time slices. The methods follow Owens and Guralnick
