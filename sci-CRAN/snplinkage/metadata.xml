		Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Linkage Disequilibrium
		Visualizations // Linkage disequilibrium visualizations of up
		to several hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
		annotated with chromosomic positions and gene names. Two types
		of plots are available for small numbers of SNPs (40) and for
		large numbers (tested up to 500). Both can be extended by
		combining other ggplots, e.g. association studies results, and
		functions enable to directly visualize the effect of SNP
		selection methods, as minor allele frequency filtering and
		TagSNP selection, with a second correlation heatmap. The SNPs
		correlations are computed on Genotype Data objects from the
		'GWASTools' package using the 'SNPRelate' package, and the
		plots are customizable 'ggplot2' and 'gtable' objects and are
		annotated using the 'biomaRt' package. Usage is detailed in the
		vignette with example data and results from up to 500 SNPs of
		1,200 scans are in Charlon T. (2019) doi:10.13097/archive-
		ouverte/unige:161795.
