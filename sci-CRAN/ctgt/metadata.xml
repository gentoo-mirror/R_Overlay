		Closed Testing with Globaltest for Pathway Analysis // A shortcut
		procedure is proposed to implement closed testing for large-
		scale multiple testings, especially with the global test. This
		shortcut is asymptotically equivalent to closed testing and
		post hoc. Users could detect any possible sets of features or
		pathways with family-wise error rate controlled. The global
		test is powerful to detect associations between a group of
		features and an outcome of interest.
