		Analyze Isotope Ratios in a 'Shiny'-App // Analyzing Inductively
		Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement data to
		evaluate isotope ratios (IRs) is a complex process. The
		'IsoCor' package facilitates this process and renders it
		reproducible by providing a function to run a 'Shiny'-App
		locally in any web browser. In this App the user can upload
		data files of various formats, select ion traces, apply peak
		detection and perform calculation of IRs and delta values.
		Results are provided as figures and tables and can be exported.
		The App, therefore, facilitates data processing of ICP-MS
		experiments to quickly obtain optimal processing parameters
		compared to traditional 'Excel' worksheet based approaches. A
		more detailed description can be found in the corresponding
		article doi:10.1039/D2JA00208F. The most recent version of
		'IsoCor' can be tested online at
		https://apps.bam.de/shn00/IsoCor/.
