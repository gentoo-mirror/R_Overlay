		RStudio Addin for Searching Packages in CRAN Database Based on
		Keywords // One of the strengths of R is its vast package
		ecosystem. Indeed, R packages extend from visualization to
		Bayesian inference and from spatial analyses to
		pharmacokinetics (https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). There
		is probably not an area of quantitative research that isn't
		represented by at least one R package. At the time of this
		writing, there are more than 10,000 active CRAN packages.
		Because of this massive ecosystem, it is important to have
		tools to search and learn about packages related to your
		personal R needs. For this reason, we developed an RStudio
		addin capable of searching available CRAN packages directly
		within RStudio.
