		Multiple Comparisons and Simultaneous Confidence Intervals //
		With this package, it is possible to compute nonparametric
		simultaneous confidence intervals for relative contrast effects
		in the unbalanced one way layout. Moreover, it computes
		simultaneous p-values. The simultaneous confidence intervals
		can be computed using multivariate normal distribution,
		multivariate t-distribution with a Satterthwaite Approximation
		of the degree of freedom or using multivariate range preserving
		transformations with Logit or Probit as transformation
		function. 2 sample comparisons can be performed with the same
		methods described above. There is no assumption on the
		underlying distribution function, only that the data have to be
		at least ordinal numbers.
