		Analyze the Impact of Sensor Error Modelling on Navigation
		Performance // Implements the framework presented in Cucci, D.
		A., Voirol, L., Khaghani, M. and Guerrier, S. (2023)
		doi:10.1109/TIM.2023.3267360 which allows to analyze the impact
		of sensor error modeling on the performance of integrated
		navigation (sensor fusion) based on inertial measurement unit
		(IMU), Global Positioning System (GPS), and barometer data. The
		framework relies on Monte Carlo simulations in which a Vanilla
		Extended Kalman filter is coupled with realistic and user-
		configurable noise generation mechanisms to recover a reference
		trajectory from noisy measurements. The evaluation of several
		statistical metrics of the solution, aggregated over hundreds
		of simulated realizations, provides reasonable estimates of the
		expected performances of the system in real-world conditions.
