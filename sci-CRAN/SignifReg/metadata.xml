		Consistent Significance Controlled Variable Selection in
		Generalized Linear Regression // Provides significance
		controlled variable selection algorithms with different
		directions (forward, backward, stepwise) based on diverse
		criteria (AIC, BIC, adjusted r-square, PRESS, or p-value). The
		algorithm selects a final model with only significant variables
		defined as those with significant p-values after multiple
		testing correction such as Bonferroni, False Discovery Rate,
		etc.
