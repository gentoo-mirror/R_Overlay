		Automatic Fixed Rank Kriging // Automatic fixed rank kriging for
		(irregularly located) spatial data using a class of basis
		functions with multi-resolution features and ordered in terms
		of their resolutions. The model parameters are estimated by
		maximum likelihood (ML) and the number of basis functions is
		determined by Akaike's information criterion (AIC). For spatial
		data with either one realization or independent replicates, the
		ML estimates and AIC are efficiently computed using their
		closed-form expressions when no missing value occurs. Details
		regarding the basis function construction, parameter
		estimation, and AIC calculation can be found in Tzeng and Huang
		(2018) doi:10.1080/00401706.2017.1345701. For data with missing
		values, the ML estimates are obtained using the expectation-
		maximization algorithm. Apart from the number of basis
		functions, there are no other tuning parameters, making the
		method fully automatic. Users can also include a stationary
		structure in the spatial covariance, which utilizes
		'LatticeKrig' package.
