		Discrete Time Simulation of Mosquito-Borne Pathogen Transmission
		// Provides a framework based on S3 dispatch for constructing
		models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission which are
		constructed from submodels of various components (i.e. immature
		and adult mosquitoes, human populations). A consistent
		mathematical expression for the distribution of bites on hosts
		means that different models (stochastic, deterministic, etc.)
		can be coherently incorporated and updated over a discrete time
		step.
