		Easily Connect to Common Types of Databases // A unified
		interface for connecting to databases ('SQLite', 'MySQL',
		'PostgreSQL'). Just provide the database name and the package
		will ask you questions to help you configure the connection and
		setup your credentials.  Once database configuration and
		connection has been set up once, you won't have to do it ever
		again.
