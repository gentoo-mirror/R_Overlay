		Fast Best Subset Selection // Extremely efficient toolkit for
		solving the best subset selection problem
		https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-1060.html. This package is
		its R interface. The package implements and generalizes
		algorithms designed in doi:10.1073/pnas.2014241117 that
		exploits a novel sequencing-and-splicing technique to guarantee
		exact support recovery and globally optimal solution in
		polynomial times for linear model. It also supports best subset
		selection for logistic regression, Poisson regression, Cox
		proportional hazard model, Gamma regression, multiple-response
		regression, multinomial logistic regression, ordinal
		regression, (sequential) principal component analysis, and
		robust principal component analysis. The other valuable
		features such as the best subset of group selection
		doi:10.1287/ijoc.2022.1241 and sure independence screening
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00674.x are also provided.
