		Adaptive Best Subset Selection in Polynomial Time // Extremely
		efficient toolkit for solving the best subset selection problem
		in linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression,
		Cox proportional hazard model, multiple-response Gaussian, and
		multinomial regression. It implements and generalizes
		algorithms designed in doi:10.1073/pnas.2014241117 that
		exploits a novel sequencing-and-splicing technique to guarantee
		exact support recovery and globally optimal solution in
		polynomial times.
