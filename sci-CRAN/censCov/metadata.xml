		Linear Regression with a Randomly Censored Covariate //
		Implementations of threshold regression approaches for linear
		regression models with a covariate subject to random censoring,
		including deletion threshold regression and completion
		threshold regression. Reverse survival regression, which flip
		the role of response variable and the covariate, is also
		considered.
