		ICU Length of Stay Prediction and Efficiency Evaluation //
		Provides tools for predicting ICU length of stay and assessing
		ICU efficiency. It is based on the methodologies proposed by
		Peres et al. (2022, 2023), which utilize data-driven approaches
		for modeling and validation, offering insights into ICU
		performance and patient outcomes. References: Peres et al.
