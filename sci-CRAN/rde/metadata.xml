		Reproducible Data Embedding // Allows caching of raw data
		directly in R code. This allows R scripts and R Notebooks to be
		shared and re-run on a machine without access to the original
		data. Cached data is encoded into an ASCII string that can be
		pasted into R code. When the code is run, the data is
		automatically loaded from the cached version if the original
		data file is unavailable. Works best for small datasets (a few
		hundred observations).
