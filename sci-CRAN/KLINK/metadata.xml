		Kinship Analysis with Linked Markers // A 'shiny' application for
		forensic kinship testing, based on the 'pedsuite' R packages.
		'KLINK' is closely aligned with the (non-R) software 'Familias'
		and 'FamLink', but offers several unique features, including
		visualisations and automated report generation. The calculation
		of likelihood ratios supports pairs of linked markers, and all
		common mutation models.
