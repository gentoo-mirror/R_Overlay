		Multiverse Analyses for Conditioning Data // A suite of functions
		for performing analyses, based on a multiverse approach, for
		conditioning data. Specifically, given the appropriate data,
		the functions are able to perform t-tests, analyses of
		variance, and mixed models for the provided data and return
		summary statistics and plots. The function is also able to
		return for all those tests p-values, confidence intervals, and
		Bayes factors. The methods are described in Lonsdorf,
		Gerlicher, Klingelhofer-Jens,  Krypotos (2022)
