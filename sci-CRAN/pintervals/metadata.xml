		Model Agnostic Prediction Intervals // Provides tools for
		estimating model-agnostic prediction intervals using conformal
		prediction, bootstrapping, and parametric prediction intervals.
		The package is designed for ease of use, offering intuitive
		functions for both binned and full conformal prediction
		methods, as well as parametric interval estimation with
		diagnostic checks. Currently only working for continuous
		predictions. For details on the conformal and bin-conditional
		conformal prediction methods, see Randahl, Williams, and Hegre
		(2024) DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2410.14507.
