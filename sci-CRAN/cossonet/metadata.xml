		Sparse Nonparametric Regression for High-Dimensional Data //
		Estimation of sparse nonlinear functions in nonparametric
		regression using component selection and smoothing. Designed
		for the analysis of high-dimensional data, the models support
		various data types, including exponential family models and Cox
		proportional hazards models. The methodology is based on Lin
		and Zhang (2006) doi:10.1214/009053606000000722.
