		IR-Tree Modeling in 'mirt', 'Mplus', or 'TAM' // Item response
		tree (IR-tree) models are a class of item response theory (IRT)
		models that assume that the responses to polytomous items can
		best be explained by multiple psychological processes; see
		Bckenholt (2012) doi:10.1037/a0028111 for details. The package
		'ItemResponseTrees' allows to fit such IR-tree models in
		'mirt', 'Mplus', or 'TAM'. The package automates some of the
		hassle of IR-tree modeling by means of a consistent syntax.
		This allows new users to quickly adopt this model class, and
		this allows experienced users to fit many complex models
		effortlessly.
