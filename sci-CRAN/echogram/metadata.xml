		Echogram Visualisation and Analysis // Easily import multi-
		frequency acoustic data stored in 'HAC' files (see
		http://biblio.uqar.ca/archives/30005500.pdf for more
		information on the format), and produce echogram visualisations
		with predefined or customized color palettes. It is also
		possible to merge consecutive echograms; mask or delete
		unwanted echogram areas; model and subtract background noise;
		and more important, develop, test and interpret different
		combinations of frequencies in order to perform acoustic
		filtering of the echogram's data.
