		Moisture Sorption Isotherm Modeling Program // Contains sixteen
		moisture sorption isotherm models, which evaluate the fitness
		of adsorption and desorption curves for further understanding
		of the relationship between moisture content and water
		activity. Fitness evaluation is conducted through parameter
		estimation and error analysis. Moreover, graphical
		representation, hysteresis area estimation, and isotherm
		classification through the equation of Blahovec  Yanniotis
		(2009) doi:10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.08.007 which is based on the
		classification system introduced by Brunauer et. al. (1940)
		doi:10.1021/ja01864a025 are also included for the visualization
		of models and hysteresis.
