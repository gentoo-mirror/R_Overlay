		Ratio-of-Uniforms Sampling for Bayesian Extreme Value Analysis //
		Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of extreme value
		models.  The 'rust' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust is used to simulate a
		random sample from the required posterior distribution. The
		functionality of 'revdbayes' is similar to the 'evdbayes'
		package https://cran.r-project.org/package=evdbayes, which uses
		Markov Chain Monte Carlo ('MCMC') methods for posterior
		simulation.  In addition, there are functions for making
		inferences about the extremal index, using the models for
		threshold inter-exceedance times of Suveges and Davison (2010)
		doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292 and Holesovsky and Fusek (2020)
		doi:10.1007/s10687-020-00374-3. Also provided are d,p,q,r
		functions for the Generalised Extreme Value ('GEV') and
		Generalised Pareto ('GP') distributions that deal appropriately
		with cases where the shape parameter is very close to zero.
