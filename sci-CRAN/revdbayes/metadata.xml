		Ratio-of-Uniforms Sampling for Bayesian Extreme Value Analysis //
		Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of extreme value
		models.  The 'rust' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust is used to simulate a
		random sample from the required posterior distribution. The
		functionality of 'revdbayes' is similar to the 'evdbayes'
		package https://cran.r-project.org/package=evdbayes, which uses
		Markov Chain Monte Carlo ('MCMC') methods for posterior
		simulation.  Also provided are functions for making inferences
		about the extremal index, using the K-gaps model of Suveges and
		Davison (2010) doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292.
