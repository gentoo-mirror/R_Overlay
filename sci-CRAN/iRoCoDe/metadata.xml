		Incomplete Row-Column Designs // The Row-column designs are
		widely recommended for experimental situations when there are
		two well-identified factors that are cross-classified
		representing known sources of variability. These designs are
		expected to result a gain in accuracy of estimating treatment
		comparisons in an experiment as they eliminate the effects of
		the row and column factors. However, these designs are not
		readily available when the number of treatments is more than
		the levels of row and column blocking factors. This package
		named 'iRoCoDe' generates row-column designs with incomplete
		rows and columns, by amalgamating two incomplete block designs
		(D1 and D2). The selection of D1 and D2 (the input designs) can
		be done from the available incomplete block designs, viz.,
		balanced incomplete block designs/ partially balanced
		incomplete block designs/ t-designs. (Mcsorley, J.P., Phillips,
		N.C., Wallis, W.D. and Yucas, J.L.
