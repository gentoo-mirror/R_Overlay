		Simultaneous Clustering and Factorial Decomposition of Three-Way
		Datasets // Implements two iterative techniques called T3Clus
		and 3Fkmeans, aimed at simultaneously clustering objects and a
		factorial dimensionality reduction of variables and occasions
		on three-mode datasets developed by Vichi et al. (2007)
		doi:10.1007/s00357-007-0006-x. Also, we provide a convex
		combination of these two simultaneous procedures called CT3Clus
		and based on a hyperparameter alpha (alpha in [0,1], with
		3FKMeans for alpha=0 and T3Clus for alpha= 1) also developed by
		Vichi et al. (2007) doi:10.1007/s00357-007-0006-x. Furthermore,
		we implemented the traditional tandem procedures of T3Clus
		(TWCFTA) and 3FKMeans (TWFCTA) for sequential clustering-
		factorial decomposition (TWCFTA), and vice-versa (TWFCTA)
		proposed by P. Arabie and L. Hubert (1996)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-642-79999-0_1.
