		'L-BFGS' Algorithm Based on 'Blaze' for 'R' and 'Rcpp' // The
		'L-BFGS' algorithm is a popular optimization algorithm for
		unconstrained optimization problems. 'Blaze' is a high-
		performance 'C++' math library for dense and sparse arithmetic.
		This package provides a simple interface to the 'L-BFGS'
		algorithm and allows users to optimize their objective
		functions with 'Blaze' vectors and matrices in 'R' and 'Rcpp'.
