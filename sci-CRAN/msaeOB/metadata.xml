		Optimum Benchmarking for Multivariate Small Area Estimation //
		Implements multivariate optimum benchmarking small area
		estimation. This package provides optimum benchmarking
		estimation for univariate and multivariate small area
		estimation and its MSE. In fact, MSE estimators for optimum
		benchmark are not readily available, so resampling method that
		called parametric bootstrap is applied. The optimum benchmark
		model and parametric bootstrap in this package are based on the
		model proposed in small area estimation. J.N.K Rao and Isabel
		Molina (2015, ISBN: 978-1-118-73578-7).
