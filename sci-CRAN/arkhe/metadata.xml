		Representation of Archaeological Data // A collection of classes
		that represent archaeological data. This package provides a set
		of S4 classes that extend the basic matrix data type
		(absolute/relative frequency, presence/absence data, co-
		occurrence matrix, etc.) upon which package developers can
		build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic methods
		(mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g.
		predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest
		(e.g. that represent stratigraphic relationships) are
		implemented.
