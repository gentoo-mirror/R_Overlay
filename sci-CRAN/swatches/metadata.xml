		Read, Inspect, and Manipulate Color Swatch Files // There are
		numerous places to create and download color palettes. These
		are usually shared in 'Adobe' swatch file formats of some kind.
		There is also often the need to use standard palettes developed
		within an organization to ensure that aesthetics are carried
		over into all projects and output. Now there is a way to read
		these swatch files in R and avoid transcribing or converting
		color values by hand or or with other programs. This package
		provides functions to read and inspect 'Adobe Color' ('ACO'),
		'Adobe Swatch Exchange' ('ASE'), 'GIMP Palette' ('GPL'),
		'OpenOffice' palette ('SOC') files and 'KDE Palette' ('colors')
		files. Detailed descriptions of 'Adobe Color' and 'Swatch
		Exchange' file formats as well as other swatch file formats can
		be found at
		http://www.selapa.net/swatches/colors/fileformats.php.
