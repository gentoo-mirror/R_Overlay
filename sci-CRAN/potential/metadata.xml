		Implementation of the Potential Model // Provides functions to
		compute the potential model as defined by Stewart (1941)
		doi:10.1126/science.93.2404.89. Several options are available
		to customize the model, such as the possibility to fine-tune
		the distance friction functions or to use custom distance
		matrices. Some computations are parallelized to improve their
		efficiency.
