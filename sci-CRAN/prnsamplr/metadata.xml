		Permanent Random Number Sampling // Survey sampling using
		permanent random numbers (PRN's). A solution to the problem of
		unknown overlap between survey samples, which leads to a low
		precision in estimates when the survey is repeated or combined
		with other surveys. The PRN solution is to supply the U(0, 1)
		random numbers to the sampling procedure, instead of having the
		sampling procedure generate them. In Lindblom (2014)
		doi:10.2478/jos-2014-0047, and therein cited papers, it is
		shown how this is carried out and how it improves the
		estimates. This package supports two common fixed-size sampling
		procedures (simple random sampling and probability-
		proportional-to-size sampling) and includes a function for
		transforming the PRN's in order to control the sample overlap.
