		Tools for Working with Recurrence Rules // Provides tools for
		defining recurrence rules and recurrence sets. Recurrence rules
		are a programmatic way to define a recurring event, like the
		first Monday of December. Multiple recurrence rules can be
		combined into larger recurrence sets. A full holiday and
		calendar interface is also provided that can generate holidays
		within a particular year, can detect if a date is a holiday,
		can respect holiday observance rules, and allows for custom
		holidays.
