		Tools for Working with Recurrence Rules // Provides tools for
		defining recurrence rules and recurrence bundles. Recurrence
		rules are a programmatic way to define a recurring event, like
		the first Monday of December. Multiple recurrence rules can be
		combined into larger recurrence bundles. Together, these
		provide a system for adjusting and generating sequences of
		dates while simultaneously skipping over dates in a recurrence
		bundle's event set.
