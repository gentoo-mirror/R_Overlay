		Progress Bars and Messages for Parallel Processes // Tools for
		monitoring progress during parallel processing. Lightweight
		package which acts as a wrapper around mclapply() and adds a
		progress bar to it in 'RStudio' or 'Linux' environments. Simply
		replace your original call to mclapply() with pmclapply(). A
		progress bar can also be displayed during parallelisation via
		the 'foreach' package. Also included are functions to safely
		print messages (including error messages) from within
		parallelised code, which can be useful for debugging
		parallelised R code.
