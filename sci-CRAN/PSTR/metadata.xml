		Panel Smooth Transition Regression Modelling // Provides the
		Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) modelling. The
		modelling procedure consists of three stages: Specification,
		Estimation and Evaluation. The package offers sharp tools
		helping the package user(s) to conduct model specification
		tests, to do PSTR model estimation, and to do model evaluation.
		The tests implemented in the package allow for cluster-
		dependency and are heteroskedasticity-consistent. The wild
		bootstrap and wild cluster bootstrap tests are also
		implemented. Parallel computation (as an option) is implemented
		in some functions, especially the bootstrap tests. The package
		suits tasks running many cores on super-computation servers.
