		Multi-Fidelity Emulator for Computer Experiments with Tunable
		Fidelity Levels // Multi-Fidelity emulator for data from
		computer simulations of the same underlying system but at
		different input locations and fidelity level, where both the
		input locations and fidelity level can be continuous. Active
		Learning can be performed with an implementation of the
		Integrated Mean Square Prediction Error (IMSPE) criterion
		developed by Boutelet and Sung (2025,
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2503.23158).
