		Discovery of Process Models with the Heuristics Miner // Provides
		the heuristics miner algorithm for process discovery as
		proposed by Weijters et al. (2011)
		doi:10.1109/CIDM.2011.5949453. The algorithm builds a causal
		net from an event log created with the 'bupaR' package. Event
		logs are a set of ordered sequences of events for which 'bupaR'
		provides the S3 class eventlog(). The discovered causal nets
		can be visualised as 'htmlwidgets' and it is possible to
		annotate them with the occurrence frequency or processing and
		waiting time of process activities.
