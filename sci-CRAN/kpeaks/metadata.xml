		Determination of K Using Peak Counts of Features for Clustering
		// The input argument k which is the number of clusters is
		needed to start all of the partitioning clustering algorithms.
		In unsupervised learning applications, an optimal value of this
		argument is widely determined by using the internal validity
		indexes. Since these indexes suggest a k value which is
		computed on the clustering results after several runs of a
		clustering algorithm they are computationally expensive. On the
		contrary, 'kpeaks' enables to estimate k before running any
		clustering algorithm. It is based on a simple novel technique
		using the descriptive statistics of peak counts of the features
		in a data set.
