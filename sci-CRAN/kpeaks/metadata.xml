		Determination of K Using Peak Counts of Features for Clustering
		// The number of clusters (k) is needed to start all the
		partitioning clustering algorithms. An optimal value of this
		input argument is widely determined by using some internal
		validity indices. Since most of the existing internal indices
		suggest a k value which is computed from the clustering results
		after several runs of a clustering algorithm they are
		computationally expensive. On the contrary,  the package
		'kpeaks' enables to estimate k before running any clustering
		algorithm. It is based on a simple novel technique using the
		descriptive statistics of peak counts of the features in a data
		set.
