		Append 'WITH (NOLOCK)' to 'SQL' Queries, Get Packages in Active
		Script // Provides a suite of tools that can assist in
		enhancing the processing efficiency of 'SQL' and 'R' scripts. -
		The 'libr_unused()' retrieves a vector of package names that
		are called within an 'R' script but are never actually used in
		the script. - The 'libr_used()' retrieves a vector of package
		names actively utilized within an 'R' script; packages loaded
		using 'library()' but not actually used in the script will not
		be included. - The 'libr_called()' retrieves a vector of all
		package names which are called within an 'R' script. -
		'nolock()' appends 'WITH (nolock)' to all tables in 'SQL'
		queries. This facilitates reading from databases in scenarios
		where non-blocking reads are preferable, such as in high-
		transaction environments.
