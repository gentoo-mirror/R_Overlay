		A Comprehensive Package for Sediment Source Unmixing // "This
		package quantifies the provenance of sediments in a catchment
		or study area. Based on a characterization of the sediment
		sources and the end sediment mixtures, a mixing model algorithm
		is applied to the sediment mixtures to estimate the relative
		contribution of each potential source. The package includes
		several graphs to help users in their data understanding, such
		as box plots, correlation, PCA, and LDA graphs. In addition,
		new developments such as the Consensus Ranking (CR), Consistent
		Tracer Selection (CTS), and Linear Variability Propagation
		(LVP) methods are included to correctly apply the
		fingerprinting technique and increase dataset and model
		understanding. A new method based on Conservative Balance (CB)
		method has also been included to enable the use of isotopic
		tracers."
