		Sediment Source Fingerprinting // Quantifies the provenance of
		the sediments in a catchment or study area. Based on a
		comprehensive characterization of the sediment sources and the
		end sediment mixtures a mixing model algorithm is applied to
		the sediment mixtures in order to estimate the relative
		contribution of each potential source. The package includes
		several statistical methods such as Kruskal-Wallis test,
		discriminant function analysis ('DFA'), principal component
		plot ('PCA') to select the optimal subset of tracer properties.
		The variability within each sediment source is also considered
		to estimate the statistical distribution of the sources
		contribution.
