		Classification Permutation Test // Non-parametric test for
		equality of multivariate distributions.  Trains a classifier to
		classify (multivariate) observations as coming from one of
		several distributions.  If the classifier is able to classify
		the observations better than would be expected by chance (using
		permutation inference), then the null hypothesis that the
		distributions are equal is rejected.
