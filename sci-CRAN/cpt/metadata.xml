		Classification Permutation Test // Non-parametric test for
		equality of multivariate distributions.  Trains a classifier to
		classify (multivariate) observations as coming from one of two
		distributions.  If the classifier is able to classify the
		observations better than would be expected by chance (using
		permutation inference), then the null hypothesis that the two
		distributions are equal is rejected.
