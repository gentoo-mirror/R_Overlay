		BRACoD: Bayesian Regression Analysis of Compositional Data // The
		goal of this method is to identify associations between
		bacteria and an environmental variable in 16S or other
		compositional data. The environmental variable is any variable
		which is measure for each microbiome sample, for example, a
		butyrate measurement paired with every sample in the data.
		Microbiome data is compositional, meaning that the total
		abundance of each sample sums to 1, and this introduces severe
		statistical distortions. This method takes a Bayesian approach
		to correcting for these statistical distortions, in which the
		total abundance is treated as an unknown variable. This package
		runs the python implementation using reticulate.
