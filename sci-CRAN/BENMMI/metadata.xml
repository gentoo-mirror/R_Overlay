		Benthic Multi-Metric Index // Analysis tool for evaluating
		benthic multimetric indices (BENMMIs). It generates
		reproducible reports on the analysis of benthic data, e.g.,
		validation and correction of species names, sample pooling,
		automatic conversion of genus to species names, outlier
		detection, benthic indicator calculation, optimization of
		single and multimetric indicators against a pressure gradient,
		and spatial aggregation of benthic indicators. One of its use
		cases was the development of a common benthic indicator for
		https://www.ospar.org (publication accepted by Ecological
		Indicators). See Van Loon et al. (2018)
		doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.09.029 for details.
