		Econometric Analysis of Explosive Time Series // Testing for and
		dating periods of explosive dynamics (exuberance) in time
		series using recursive unit root tests as proposed by Phillips,
		P. C., Shi, S. and Yu, J. (2015a) doi:10.1111/iere.12132.
		Simulate a variety of periodically-collapsing bubble models.
		The estimation and simulation utilizes the matrix inversion
		lemma from the recursive least squares algorithm, which results
		in a significant speed improvement.
