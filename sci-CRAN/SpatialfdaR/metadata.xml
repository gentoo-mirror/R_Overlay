		Spatial Functional Data Analysis // Finite element modeling (FEM)
		uses meshes of triangles to define surfaces. A surface within a
		triangle may be either linear or quadratic. In the order one
		case each node in the mesh is associated with a basis function
		and the basis is called the order one finite element basis. In
		the order two case each edge mid-point is also associated with
		a basis function.  Functions are provided for smoothing,
		density function estimation point evaluation and plotting
		results.  Two papers illustrating the finite element data
		analysis are Sangalli, L.M., Ramsay, J.O., Ramsay, T.O.
