		Advanced Inference with Random Graphical Models // Implements
		state-of-the-art Random Graphical Models (RGMs) for
		multivariate data analysis across multiple environments,
		offering tools for exploring network interactions and
		structural relationships. Capabilities include joint inference
		across environments, integration of external covariates, and a
		Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification. Applicable
		in various fields, including microbiome analysis. Methods based
		on Vinciotti, V., Wit, E.,  Richter, F. (2023). "Random
		Graphical Model of Microbiome Interactions in Related
		Environments." arXiv:2304.01956.
