		Graphical Markov Models with Mixed Graphs // Provides functions
		for defining mixed graphs containing three types of edges,
		directed, undirected and bi-directed, with possibly multiple
		edges. These graphs are useful because they capture fundamental
		independence structures in multivariate distributions and in
		the induced distributions after marginalization and
		conditioning. The package is especially concerned with Gaussian
		graphical models for (i) ML estimation for directed acyclic
		graphs, undirected and bi-directed graphs and ancestral graph
		models (ii) testing several conditional independencies (iii)
		checking global identification of DAG Gaussian models with one
		latent variable (iv) testing Markov equivalences and generating
		Markov equivalent graphs of specific types.
