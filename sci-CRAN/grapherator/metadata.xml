		A Modular Multi-Step Graph Generator // Set of functions for
		step-wise generation of (weighted) graphs. Aimed for research
		in the field of single- and multi-objective combinatorial
		optimization. Graphs are generated adding nodes, edges and
		weights. Each step may be repeated multiple times with
		different predefined and custom generators resulting in high
		flexibility regarding the graph topology and structure of edge
		weights.
