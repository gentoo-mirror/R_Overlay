		Geometric Tools Based on Balanced/Unbalanced Optimal Transport //
		Includes a variety of methods to compute objects related to the
		'Wasserstein distance' (also known as 'Kantorovich distance' or
		'Earth-Mover distance'). The main effort of this package is to
		allow for computations of 'Wasserstein barycenter' using
		regularised, unregularised and stochastic methods. It also
		provides convenient wrappers to call the 'transport' package
		with more general inputs. Handy visual tools are provided to
		showcase, barycenters, animations of optimal transport
		geodesics and animations of principal components in the
		'Wasserstein space'. It also includes tools to compute
		'Kantorovich-Rubinstein' distances and barycenters.
