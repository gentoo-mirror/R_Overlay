		Proximity Catch Digraphs and Their Applications // Contains the
		functions for construction and visualization of various
		families of the proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) (see (Ceyhan
		(2005) ISBN:978-3-639-19063-2), for computing the graph
		invariants for testing the patterns of segregation and
		association against complete spatial randomness (CSR) or
		uniformity in one, two and three dimensional cases. The package
		also has tools for generating points from these spatial
		patterns. The graph invariants used in testing spatial point
		data are the domination number (Ceyhan (2011)
		doi:10.1080/03610921003597211) and arc density (Ceyhan et al.
		(2006) doi:10.1016/j.csda.2005.03.002; Ceyhan et al. (2007)
		doi:10.1002/cjs.5550350106). The PCD families considered are
		Arc-Slice PCDs, Proportional-Edge PCDs, and Central Similarity
		PCDs.
