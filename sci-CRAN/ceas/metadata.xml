		Cellular Energetics Analysis Software // Measuring cellular
		energetics is essential to understanding a matrixs (e.g. cell,
		tissue or biofluid) metabolic state. The Agilent Seahorse
		machine is a common method to measure real-time cellular
		energetics, but existing analysis tools are highly manual or
		lack functionality. The Cellular Energetics Analysis Software
		(ceas) R package fills this analytical gap by providing modular
		and automated Seahorse data analysis and visualization using
		the methods described by Mookerjee et al. (2017)
