		Cellular Energetics Analysis Software // Analysis and
		visualization of cellular energetics data from Agilent Seahorse
		XF96. Cellular energetics is how cells make, use, and
		distribute units of energy (primarily ATP). Measuring real-time
		cellular energetics is essential to understanding a tissue or
		cells bioenergetic state and fuel dependencies. The Seahorse
		machine measures a cells or matrixs oxygen consumption rate
		(OCR)  a proxy of oxidative phosphorylation  and extracellular
		acidification rate  a proxy of glycolysis. This package offers
		flexible and fast analysis and plotting capabilities for such
		data using the methods described by Mookerjee et al. (2017)
