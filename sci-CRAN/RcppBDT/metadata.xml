		'Rcpp' Bindings for the Boost Date_Time Library // Access to
		Boost Date_Time functionality for dates, durations (both for
		days and date time objects), time zones, and posix time
		('ptime') is provided by using 'Rcpp modules'. The posix time
		implementation can support high-resolution of up to nano-second
		precision by using 96 bits (instead of 64 with R) to present a
		'ptime' object (but this needs recompilation with a #define
		set).
