		A Genetic Algorithm for Fixed-Size Subset Selection // Provides a
		function that uses a genetic algorithm to search for a subset
		of size k from the integers 1:n, such that a user-supplied
		objective function is minimized at that subset.  The selection
		step is done by tournament selection based on ranks, and
		elitism may be used to retain a portion of the best solutions
		from one generation to the next. Population objective function
		values may optionally be evaluated in parallel.
