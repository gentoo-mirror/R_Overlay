		Microbial Niche Measurements // Measures niche breadth and
		overlap of microbial taxa from large matrices. Niche breadth
		measurements include Levins' niche breadth (Bn) index,
		Hurlbert's Bn and Feinsinger's proportional similarity (PS)
		index. (Feinsinger, P., Spears, E.E., Poole, R.W. (1981)
		doi:10.2307/1936664). Niche overlap measurements include
		Levin's Overlap (Ludwig, J.A. and Reynolds, J.F. (1988,
		ISBN:0471832359)) and a Jaccard similarity index of
		Feinsinger's PS values between taxa pairs, as Proportional
		Overlap.
