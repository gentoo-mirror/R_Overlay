		Imputation of Time Series Based on Fuzzy Logic // Filling large
		gaps in low or uncorrelated multivariate time series uses a new
		fuzzy weighted similarity measure. It contains all required
		functions to create large missing consecutive values within
		time series and then fill these gaps, according to the paper
		Phan et al. (2018), DOI:10.1155/2018/9095683. Performance
		indicators are also provided to compare similarity between two
		univariate signals (incomplete signal and imputed signal).
