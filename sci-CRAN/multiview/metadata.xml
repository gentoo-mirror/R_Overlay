		Cooperative Learning for Multi-View Analysis // Cooperative
		learning combines the usual squared error loss of predictions
		with an agreement penalty to encourage the predictions from
		different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the
		agreement penalty, we get a continuum of solutions that include
		the well-known early and late fusion approaches. Cooperative
		learning chooses the degree of agreement (or fusion) in an
		adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to
		estimate test set prediction error. In the setting of
		cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines
		the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty (Ding, D., Li, S.,
		Narasimhan, B., Tibshirani, R. (2021) arXiv:2112.12337).
