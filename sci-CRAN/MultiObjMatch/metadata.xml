		Multi-Objective Matching Algorithm // Matching algorithm based on
		network-flow structure. Users are able to modify the emphasis
		on three different optimization goals: two different distance
		measures and the number of treated units left unmatched. The
		method is proposed by Pimentel and Kelz (2019)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1720693. The 'rrelaxiv' package,
		which provides an alternative solver for the underlying network
		flow problems, carries an academic license and is not available
		on CRAN, but may be downloaded from Github at
		https://github.com/josherrickson/rrelaxiv/.
