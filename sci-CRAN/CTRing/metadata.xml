		Density Profiles of Wood from CT Scan Images // Computerized
		tomography (CT) can be used to assess certain wood properties
		when wood disks or logs are scanned. Wood density profiles
		(i.e. variations of wood density from pith to bark) can yield
		important information used for studies in forest resource
		assessment, wood quality and dendrochronology studies. The
		first step consists in transforming grey values from the scan
		images to density values. The packages then proposes a unique
		method to automatically locate the pith by combining an adapted
		Hough Transform method and a one-dimensional edge detector.
		Tree ring profiles (average ring density, earlywood and
		latewood density, ring width and percent latewood for each
		ring) are then obtained.
