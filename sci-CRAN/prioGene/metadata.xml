		Candidate Gene Prioritization for Non-Communicable Diseases Based
		on Functional Information // In gene sequencing methods, the
		topological features of protein-protein interaction (PPI)
		networks are often used, such as ToppNet
		https://toppgene.cchmc.org. In this study, a candidate gene
		prioritization method was proposed for non-communicable
		diseases considering disease risks transferred between genes in
		weighted disease PPI networks with weights for nodes and edges
		based on functional information.
