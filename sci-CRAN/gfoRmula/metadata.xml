		Parametric G-Formula // Implements the parametric g-formula
		algorithm of Robins (1986) doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6.
		The g-formula can be used to estimate the causal effects of
		hypothetical time-varying treatment interventions on the mean
		or risk of an outcome from longitudinal data with time-varying
		confounding. This package allows: 1) binary or
		continuous/multi-level time-varying treatments; 2) different
		types of outcomes (survival or continuous/binary end of follow-
		up); 3) data with competing events or truncation by death and
		loss to follow-up and other types of censoring events; 4)
		different options for handling competing events in the case of
		survival outcomes; 5) a random measurement/visit process; 6)
		joint interventions on multiple treatments; and 7) general
		incorporation of a priori knowledge of the data structure.
