		Parametric G-Formula // Implements the non-iterative conditional
		expectation (NICE) algorithm of the g-formula algorithm (Robins
		(1986) doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6, Hernn and Robins
		(2024, ISBN:9781420076165)). The g-formula can estimate an
		outcome's counterfactual mean or risk under hypothetical
		treatment strategies (interventions) when there is sufficient
		information on time-varying treatments and confounders. This
		package can be used for discrete or continuous time-varying
		treatments and for failure time outcomes or continuous/binary
		end of follow-up outcomes. The package can handle a random
		measurement/visit process and a priori knowledge of the data
		structure, as well as censoring (e.g., by loss to follow-up)
		and two options for handling competing events for failure time
		outcomes. Interventions can be flexibly specified, both as
		interventions on a single treatment or as joint interventions
		on multiple treatments. See McGrath et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100008 for a guide on how to use the
		package.
