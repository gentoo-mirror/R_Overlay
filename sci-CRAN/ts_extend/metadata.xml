		Stationary Gaussian ARMA Processes and Other Time-Series
		Utilities // Stationary Gaussian ARMA processes and the
		stationary 'GARMA' distribution are fundamental in time series
		analysis. Here we give utilities to compute the auto-
		covariance/auto-correlation for a stationary Gaussian ARMA
		process, as well as the probability functions (density,
		cumulative distribution, random generation) for random vectors
		from this distribution.  We also give functions for the
		spectral intensity, and the permutation-spectrum test for
		testing a time-series vector for the presence of a signal.
