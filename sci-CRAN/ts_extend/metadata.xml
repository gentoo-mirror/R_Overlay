		Stationary Gaussian ARMA Processes and Other Time-Series
		Utilities // Stationary Gaussian ARMA processes and the
		stationary 'GARMA' distribution are fundamental in time series
		analysis. The permutation-spectrum test can detect a periodic
		signal in a real or complex time-series. Utilities to compute
		the auto-covariance/auto-correlation for a stationary Gaussian
		ARMA process, as well as the density, cumulative distribution,
		and spectral intensity are also implemented, as is random
		series generation.
