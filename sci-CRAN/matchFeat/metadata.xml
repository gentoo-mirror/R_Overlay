		One-to-One Feature Matching // Statistical methods to match
		feature vectors between multiple datasets in a one-to-one
		fashion. Given a fixed number of classes/distributions, for
		each unit, exactly one vector of each class is observed without
		label. The goal is to label the feature vectors using each
		label exactly once so to produce the best match across
		datasets, e.g. by minimizing the variability within classes.
		Statistical solutions based on empirical loss functions and
		probabilistic modeling are provided. The 'Gurobi' software and
		its 'R' interface package are required for one of the package
		functions (match.2x()) and can be obtained at
		https://www.gurobi.com/ (free academic license). For more
		details, refer to Degras (2022)

		for large data collections" and Bandelt, Maas, and Spieksma
		(2004) doi:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601723 "Local search
		heuristics for multi-index assignment problems with
