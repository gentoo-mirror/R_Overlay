		Simulation and Prediction with Seasonal ARIMA Models //
		Functions, classes and methods for time series modelling with
		ARIMA and related models. The aim of the package is to provide
		consistent interface for the user. For example, a single
		function autocorrelations() computes various kinds of
		theoretical and sample autocorrelations. This is work in
		progress, see the documentation and vignettes for the current
		functionality.
