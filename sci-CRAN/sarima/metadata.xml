		Simulation and Prediction with Seasonal ARIMA Models //
		Functions, classes and methods for time series modelling with
		ARIMA and related models. The aim of the package is to provide
		consistent interface for the user. For example, a single
		function autocorrelations() computes various kinds of
		theoretical and sample autocorrelations. This is work in
		progress, see the documentation and vignettes for the current
		functionality.  Function sarima() fits extended multiplicative
		seasonal ARIMA models with trends, exogenous variables and
		arbitrary roots on the unit circle, which can be fixed or
		estimated (for the algebraic basis for this see
		arXiv:2208.05055, a paper on the methodology is being
		prepared).
