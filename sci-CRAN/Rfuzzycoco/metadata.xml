		Provides an R Interface to the 'FuzzyCoCo' C++ Library and
		Extends It // Provides and extends the 'Fuzzy Coco' algorithm
		by wrapping the 'FuzzyCoCo' 'C++' Library, cf
		https://github.com/Lonza-RND-Data-Science/fuzzycoco. 'Fuzzy
		Coco' constructs systems that predict the outcome of a human
		decision-making process while providing an understandable
		explanation of a possible reasoning leading to it.  The
		constructed fuzzy systems are composed of rules and linguistic
		variables.  This package provides a 'S3' classic interface
		(fit_xy()/fit()/predict()/evaluate()) and a
		'tidymodels'/'parsnip' interface, a custom engine with custom
		iteration stop criterion and progress bar support as well as a
		systematic implementation that do not rely on genetic
		programming but rather explore all possible combinations.
