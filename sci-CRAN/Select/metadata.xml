		Determines Species Probabilities Based on Functional Traits //
		The objective of these functions is to derive a species
		assemblage that satisfies a functional trait profile. Restoring
		resilient ecosystems requires a flexible framework for
		selecting assemblages that are based on the functional traits
		of species. However, current trait-based models have been
		limited to algorithms that can only select species by
		optimising specific trait values, and could not elegantly
		accommodate the common desire among restoration ecologists to
		produce functionally diverse assemblages. We have solved this
		problem by applying a non-linear optimisation algorithm that
		optimises Rao Q, a closed-form functional trait diversity index
		that incorporates species abundances, subject to other linear
		constraints. This framework generalises previous models that
		only optimised the entropy of the community, and can optimise
		both functional diversity and entropy simultaneously. This
		package can also be used to generate experimental assemblages
		to test the effects of community-level traits on community
		dynamics and ecosystem function. The method is based on theory
		discussed in Laughlin (2014, Ecology Letters)
