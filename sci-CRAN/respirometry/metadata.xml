		Tools for Conducting and Analyzing Respirometry Experiments //
		Provides tools to enable the researcher to more precisely
		conduct respirometry experiments. Strong emphasis is on aquatic
		respirometry. Tools focus on helping the researcher setup and
		conduct experiments. Analysis of the resulting data is not a
		focus since analyses are often specific to a particular setup,
		and thus are better created by the researcher individually.
		This package provides tools for intermittent, flow-through, and
		closed respirometry techniques.
