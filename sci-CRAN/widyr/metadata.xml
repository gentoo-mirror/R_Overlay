		Widen, Process, then Re-Tidy Data // Encapsulates the pattern of
		untidying data into a wide matrix, performing some processing,
		then turning it back into a tidy form. This is useful for
		several operations such as co-occurrence counts, correlations,
		or clustering that are mathematically convenient on wide
		matrices.
