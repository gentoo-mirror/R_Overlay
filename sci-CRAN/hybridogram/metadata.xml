		Function that Creates a Heat Map from Hybridization Data // Using
		hybrid data, this package created a vividly colored hybrid heat
		map. The input is two files which are auto-selected. The first
		file has three columns, the first two for pairs of species,
		with the third column for the hybrid experiment code (an
		integer). The second file is a list of code and their
		descriptions in two columns. The output is a figure showing the
		hybrid heat map with a color legend.
