		Analysis of Surface Plasmon Resonance Data // Analysis of Surface
		Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Biolayer Interferometry data, with
		automations for high-throughput SPR. This version of the
		package fits the 1: 1 binding model, with and without
		bulkshift. It offers optional local or global Rmax fitting. The
		user must provide a sample sheet and a Carterra output file in
		Carterra's current format. There is a utility function to
		convert from Carterra's old output format. The user may run a
		custom pipeline or use the provided 'Runscript', which will
		produce a pdf file containing fitted Rmax, ka, kd and standard
		errors, a plot of the sensorgram and fits, and a plot of
		residuals. The script will also produce a .csv file with all of
		the relevant parameters for each spot on the SPR chip.
