		Tools for Analyzing Finite Mixture Models // Analyzes finite
		mixture models for various parametric and semiparametric
		settings.  This includes mixtures of parametric distributions
		(normal, multivariate normal, multinomial, gamma), various
		Reliability Mixture Models (RMMs), mixtures-of-regressions
		settings (linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson
		regression, linear regression with changepoints, predictor-
		dependent mixing proportions, random effects regressions,
		hierarchical mixtures-of-experts), and tools for selecting the
		number of components (bootstrapping the likelihood ratio test
		statistic, mixturegrams, and model selection criteria).
		Bayesian estimation of mixtures-of-linear-regressions models is
		available as well as a novel data depth method for obtaining
		credible bands.  This package is based upon work supported by
		the National Science Foundation under Grant No. SES-0518772 and
		the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative: Essential Open Source Software
		for Science (Grant No. 2020-255193).
