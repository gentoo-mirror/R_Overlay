		Weighted Mixed-Effects Models, using Multilevel Pseudo Maximum
		Likelihood Estimation // Run mixed-effects models that include
		weights at every level. The WeMix package fits a Weighted Mixed
		model, also known as a multilevel, mixed, or hierarchical
		linear model (HLM). The weights could be inverse selection
		probabilities, such as those developed for an education survey
		where schools are sampled probabilistically, and then students
		inside of those schools are sampled probabilistically. Although
		mixed-effects models are already available in R, WeMix is
		unique in implementing methods for mixed models using weights
		at multiple levels. The model is fit using adaptive quadrature.
