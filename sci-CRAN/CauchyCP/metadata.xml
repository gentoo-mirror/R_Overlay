		Powerful Test for Survival Data under Non-Proportional Hazards //
		An omnibus test of change-point Cox regression models to
		improve the statistical power of detecting signals of non-
		proportional hazards patterns. The technical details can be
		found in Hong Zhang, Qing Li, Devan Mehrotra and Judong Shen
		(2021) arXiv:2101.00059. Extensive simulation studies
		demonstrate that, compared to existing tests under non-
		proportional hazards, the proposed CauchyCP test 1) controls
		the type I error better at small alpha levels; 2) increases the
		power of detecting time-varying effects; and 3) is more
		computationally efficient.
