		Risk Score Plot for Cox Regression // The risk plot may be one of
		the most commonly used figures in tumor genetic data analysis.
		We can conclude the following two points: Comparing the
		prediction results of the model with the real survival
		situation to see whether the survival rate of the high-risk
		group is lower than that of the low-level group, and whether
		the survival time of the high-risk group is shorter than that
		of the low-risk group. The other is to compare the heat map and
		scatter plot to see the correlation between the predictors and
		the outcome.
