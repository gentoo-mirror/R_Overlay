		Plot Event Times on a 24-Hour Clock // Provides a novel
		visualization technique for plotting timestamped events on a
		24-hour circular clock face. This is particularly useful for
		analyzing daily patterns, event clustering, and gaps in
		temporal data. The package also generalizes this approach to
		create cyclic charts for other periods, including weekly and
		monthly cycles, enabling effective event planning and pattern
		analysis across multiple time frames.
