		Obesity Cost Database // This database contains necessary data
		relevant to medical costs on obesity throughout the United
		States. This database, in form of an R package, could output
		necessary data frames relevant to obesity costs, where the
		clients could easily manipulate the output using difference
		parameters, e.g. relative risks for each illnesses. This
		package contributes to parts of our published journal named
		"Modeling the Economic Cost of Obesity Risk and Its Relation to
		the Health Insurance Premium in the United States: A State
		Level Analysis". Please use the following citation for the
		journal: Woods Thomas, Tatjana Miljkovic (2022) "Modeling the
		Economic Cost of Obesity Risk and Its Relation to the Health
		Insurance Premium in the United States: A State Level Analysis"
		doi:10.3390/risks10100197. The database is composed of the
		following main tables: 1. Relative_Risks: (constant) Relative
		risks for a given disease group with a risk factor of obesity;
		2. Disease_Cost: (obesity_cost_disease) Supplementary output
		with all variables related to individual disease groups in a
		given state and year; 3. Full_Cost: (obesity_cost_full)
		Complete output with all variables used to make cost
		calculations, as well as cost calculations in a given state and
		year; 4. National_Summary: (obesity_cost_national_summary)
		National summary cost calculations in a given year. Three
		functions are included to assist users in calling and adjusting
		the mentioned tables and they are data_load(), data_produce(),
		and rel_risk_fun().
