		Convert Between Jalaali (Persian or Solar Hijri) and Gregorian
		Calendar Dates // The Jalaali calendar, also known as the
		Persian or Solar Hijri calendar, is the official calendar of
		Iran and Afghanistan. It starts on Nowruz, the spring equinox,
		and follows an astronomical system for determining leap years.
		Each year consists of 365 or 366 days, divided into 12 months.
		This package provides functions for converting dates between
		the Jalaali and Gregorian calendars. The conversion
		calculations are based on the work of Kazimierz M. Borkowski
		(1996) (doi:10.1007/BF00055188), who used an analytical model
		of Earth's motion to compute equinoxes from AD 550 to 3800 and
		determine leap years based on Tehran time.
