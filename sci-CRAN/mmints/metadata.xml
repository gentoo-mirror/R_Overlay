		Workflows for Building Web Applications // Sharing statistical
		methods or simulation frameworks through 'shiny' applications
		often requires workflows for handling data. To help save and
		display simulation results, the postgresUI() and
		postgresServer() functions in 'mmints' help with persistent
		data storage using a 'PostgreSQL' database. The 'mmints'
		package also offers data upload functionality through the
		csvUploadUI() and csvUploadServer() functions which allow users
		to upload data, view variables and their types, and edit
		variable types before fitting statistical models within the
		'shiny' application. These tools aim to enhance efficiency and
		user interaction in 'shiny' based statistical and simulation
		applications.
