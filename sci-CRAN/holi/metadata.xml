		Higher Order Likelihood Inference Web Applications // Higher
		order likelihood inference is a promising approach for
		analyzing small sample size data. The 'holi' package provides
		web applications for higher order likelihood inference. It
		currently supports linear, logistic, and Poisson generalized
		linear models through the rstar_glm() function, based on Pierce
		and Bellio (2017) doi:10.1111/insr.12232 and 'likelihoodAsy'.
		The package offers two main features: LA_rstar(), which
		launches an interactive 'shiny' application allowing users to
		fit models with rstar_glm() through their web browser, and
		sim_rstar_glm_pgsql(), which streamlines the process of
		launching a web-based 'shiny' simulation application that saves
		results to a user-created 'PostgreSQL' database.
