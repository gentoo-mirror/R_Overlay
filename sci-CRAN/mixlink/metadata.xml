		Mixture Link Regression // The Mixture Link model
		arXiv:1612.03302 is a proposed extension to generalized linear
		models, where the outcome distribution is a finite mixture of J
		1 densities. This package supports Mixture Link computations
		for Poisson and Binomial outcomes. This includes the
		distribution functions, numerical maximum likelihood
		estimation, Bayesian analysis, and quantile residuals to assess
		model fit.
