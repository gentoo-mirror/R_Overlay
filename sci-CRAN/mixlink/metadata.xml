		Mixture Link Regression // The Mixture Link model
		http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03302 is a proposed extension to
		generalized linear models, where the outcome distribution is a
		finite mixture of J  1 densities. This package supports Mixture
		Link computations for Poisson and Binomial outcomes. This
		includes the distribution functions, numerical maximum
		likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and quantile
		residuals to assess model fit.
