		Dynamic Model of Ammonia Emission from Field-Applied Manure // An
		implementation of the ALFAM2 dynamic emission model for ammonia
		volatilization from field-applied animal slurry (manure with
		dry matter below about 15%). The model can be used to predict
		cumulative emission and emission rate of ammonia following
		field application of slurry. Predictions may be useful for
		emission inventory calculations, fertilizer management,
		assessment of mitigation strategies, or research aimed at
		understanding ammonia emission. Default parameter sets include
		effects of application method, slurry composition, and weather.
		The model structure is based on a simplified representation of
		the physical-chemical slurry-soil-atmosphere system. See Hafner
		et al. (2018) doi:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.11.034 for
		information on the model and Hafner et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.11.027 for more on the measurement
		data used for parameter development.
