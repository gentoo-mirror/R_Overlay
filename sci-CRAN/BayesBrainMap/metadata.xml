		Estimate Brain Networks and Connectivity with Population-Derived
		Priors // Implements Bayesian brain mapping models, including
		the prior ICA (independent components analysis) model proposed
		in Mejia et al. (2020) doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1679638 and
		the spatial prior ICA model proposed in proposed in Mejia et
		al. (2022) doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2104289. Both models
		estimate subject-level brain as deviations from known
		population-level networks, which are estimated using standard
		ICA algorithms. Both models employ an expectation-maximization
		algorithm for estimation of the latent brain networks and
		unknown model parameters. Includes direct support for 'CIFTI',
		'GIFTI', and 'NIFTI' neuroimaging file formats.
