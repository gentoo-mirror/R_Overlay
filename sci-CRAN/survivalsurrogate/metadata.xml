		Evaluate a Longitudinal Surrogate with a Censored Outcome //
		Provides influence function-based methods to evaluate a
		longitudinal surrogate marker in a censored time-to-event
		outcome setting, with plug-in and targeted maximum likelihood
		estimation options. Details are described in: Agniel D and
		Parast L (2025). "Robust Evaluation of Longitudinal Surrogate
		Markers with Censored Data." Journal of the Royal Statistical
