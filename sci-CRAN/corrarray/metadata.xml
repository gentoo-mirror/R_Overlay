		Correlation Arrays and 2-Sample Correlation Matrices // The goal
		of 'corrarray' is to create a multi-sample correlation array by
		combining the correlation matrices of a data set stratified by
		a grouping variable. For two specified levels of the variable,
		'corrarray' displays one level's correlation matrix in the
		lower triangular matrix and the other level's correlation
		matrix in the upper triangular matrix. Such an output can
		enable visualization of correlations from two samples in a
		single correlation matrix or corrgram.
