		Inverse Stable Prior for Widely-Used Exponential Models //
		Contains functions that allow Bayesian inference on a parameter
		of some widely-used exponential models. The functions can
		generate independent samples from the closed-form posterior
		distribution using the inverse stable prior. Inverse stable is
		a non-conjugate prior for a parameter of an exponential
		subclass of discrete and continuous data distributions (e.g.
		Poisson, exponential, inverse gamma, double exponential
		(Laplace), half-normal/half-Gaussian, etc.). The prior class
		provides flexibility in capturing a wide array of prior beliefs
		(right-skewed and left-skewed) as modulated by a parameter that
		is bounded in (0,1). The generated samples can be used to
		simulate the prior and posterior predictive distributions. More
		details can be found in Cahoy and Sedransk (2019)
		doi:10.1007/s42519-018-0027-2. The package can also be used as
		a teaching demo for introductory Bayesian courses.
