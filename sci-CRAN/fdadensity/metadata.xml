		Functional Data Analysis for Density Functions by Transformation
		to a Hilbert Space // An implementation of the methodology
		described in Petersen and Mueller (2016) doi:10.1214/15-AOS1363
		for the functional data analysis of samples of density
		functions.  Densities are first transformed to their
		corresponding log quantile densities, followed by ordinary
		Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA).
		Transformation modes of variation yield improved interpretation
		of the variability in the data as compared to FPCA on the
		densities themselves.  The standard fraction of variance
		explained (FVE) criterion commonly used for functional data is
		adapted to the transformation setting, also allowing for an
		alternative quantification of variability for density data
		through the Wasserstein metric of optimal transport.
