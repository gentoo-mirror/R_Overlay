		Interpreting Differences Between Mean ACT Scores // Interpreting
		the differences between mean scale scores across various forms
		of an assessment can be challenging. This difficulty arises
		from different mappings between raw scores and scale scores,
		complex mathematical relationships, adjustments based on
		judgmental procedures, and diverse equating functions applied
		to different assessment forms. An alternative method involves
		running simulations to explore the effect of incrementing raw
		scores on mean scale scores. The 'idmact' package provides an
		implementation of this approach based on the algorithm detailed
		in Schiel (1998) https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/
		documents/ACT_RR98-01.pdf which was developed to help interpret
		differences between mean scale scores on the American College
		Testing (ACT) assessment. The function idmact_subj() within the
		package offers a framework for running simulations on subject-
		level scores. In contrast, the idmact_comp() function provides
		a framework for conducting simulations on composite scores.
