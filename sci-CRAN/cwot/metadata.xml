		Cauchy Weighted Joint Test for Pharmacogenetics Analysis // A
		flexible and robust joint test of the single nucleotide
		polymorphism (SNP) main effect and genotype-by-treatment
		interaction effect for continuous and binary endpoints. Two
		analytic procedures, Cauchy weighted joint test (CWOT) and
		adaptively weighted joint test (AWOT), are proposed to
		accurately calculate the joint test p-value. The proposed
		methods are evaluated through extensive simulations under
		various scenarios. The results show that the proposed AWOT and
		CWOT control type I error well and outperform existing methods
		in detecting the most interesting signal patterns in
		pharmacogenetics (PGx) association studies. For reference, see
