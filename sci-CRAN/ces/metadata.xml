		Access to Canadian Election Study Data // Provides tools to
		easily access and analyze Canadian Election Study data. The
		package simplifies the process of downloading, cleaning, and
		using 'CES' datasets for political science research and
		analysis. The Canadian Election Study ('CES') has been
		conducted during federal elections since 1965, surveying
		Canadians on their political preferences, engagement, and
		demographics. Data is accessed from multiple sources including
		the 'Borealis' Data repository https://borealisdata.ca/ and the
		official 'Canadian Election Study' website https://ces-
		eec.arts.ubc.ca/. This package is not officially affiliated
		with the Canadian Election Study, 'Borealis' Data, or the
		University of British Columbia, and users should cite the
		original data sources in their work.
