		Access to Canadian Election Study Data // Provides tools to
		easily access and analyze Canadian Election Study data. The
		package simplifies the process of downloading, cleaning, and
		using 'CES' datasets for political science research and
		analysis. The Canadian Election Study ('CES') has been
		conducted during federal elections since 1965, surveying
		Canadians on their political preferences, engagement, and
		demographics. Data is accessed from the 'Borealis' Data
		repository https://borealisdata.ca/, which serves as the
		official host for 'CES' datasets. This package is not
		officially affiliated with the Canadian Election Study or
		'Borealis' Data, and users should cite the original data
		sources in their work.
