		Adsorption Isotherm Model Fitting // The Langmuir and Freundlich
		adsorption isotherms are pivotal in characterizing adsorption
		processes, essential across various scientific disciplines.
		Proper interpretation of adsorption isotherms involves robust
		fitting of data to the models, accurate estimation of
		parameters, and efficiency evaluation of the models, both in
		linear and non-linear forms. For researchers and practitioners
		in the fields of chemistry, environmental science, soil
		science, and engineering, a comprehensive package that
		satisfies all these requirements would be ideal for accurate
		and efficient analysis of adsorption data, precise model
		selection and validation for rigorous scientific inquiry and
		real-world applications. Details can be found in Langmuir
		(1918) doi:10.1021/ja02242a004 and Giles (1973)
		doi:10.1111/j.1478-4408.1973.tb03158.x.
