		Joint Modeling of Traditional and Environmental DNA Survey Data
		in a Bayesian Framework // Models integrate environmental DNA
		(eDNA) detection data and traditional survey data to jointly
		estimate species catch rate (see package vignette:
		https://bookdown.org/abigailkeller/eDNAjoint_vignette/). Models
		can be used with count data via traditional survey methods
		(i.e., trapping, electrofishing, visual) and replicated eDNA
		detection/nondetection data via polymerase chain reaction
		(i.e., PCR or qPCR) from multiple survey locations. Estimated
		parameters include probability of a false positive eDNA
		detection, a site-level covariates that scale the sensitivity
		of eDNA surveys relative to traditional surveys, and
		catchability coefficients for traditional gear types. Models
		are implemented with a Bayesian framework (Markov chain Monte
		Carlo) using the 'Stan' probabilistic programming language.
