		Cross-Validation for the SVD (Bi-Cross-Validation) // Methods for
		choosing the rank of an SVD (singular value decomposition)
		approximation via cross validation. The package provides both
		Gabriel-style "block" holdouts and Wold-style "speckled"
		holdouts. It also includes an implementation of the SVDImpute
		algorithm. For more information about Bi-cross-validation, see
		Owen  Perry's 2009 AoAS article (at arXiv:0908.2062) and
		Perry's 2009 PhD thesis (at arXiv:0909.3052).
