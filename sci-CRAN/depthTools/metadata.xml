		Depth Tools Package // depthTools is a package that implements
		different statistical tools for the description and analysis of
		gene expression data based on the concept of data depth,
		namely, the scale curves for visualizing the dispersion of one
		or various groups of samples (e.g. types of tumors), a rank
		test to decide whether two groups of samples come from a single
		distribution and two methods of supervised classification
		techniques, the DS and TAD methods. All these techniques are
		based on the Modified Band Depth, which is a recent notion of
		depth with a low computational cost, what renders it very
		appropriate for high dimensional data such as gene expression
		data.
