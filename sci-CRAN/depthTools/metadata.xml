		Depth Tools Package // Implementation of different statistical
		tools for the description and analysis of gene expression data
		based on the concept of data depth, namely, the scale curves
		for visualizing the dispersion of one or various groups of
		samples (e.g. types of tumors), a rank test to decide whether
		two groups of samples come from a single distribution and two
		methods of supervised classification techniques, the DS and TAD
		methods. All these techniques are based on the Modified Band
		Depth, which is a recent notion of depth with a low
		computational cost, what renders it very appropriate for high
		dimensional data such as gene expression data.
