		Tests of Matrix Structure for Construct Validation // Tests for
		block-diagonal structure in symmetric matrices (e.g.
		correlation matrices) under the null hypothesis of exchangeable
		off-diagonal elements. As described in Segal et al. (2019),
		these tests can be useful for construct validation either by
		themselves or as a complement to confirmatory factor analysis.
		Monte Carlo methods are used to approximate the permutation
		p-value with Hubert's Gamma (Hubert, 1976) and a t-statistic.
		This package also implements the chi-squared statistic
		described by Steiger (1980). Please see Segal, et al. (2019)
