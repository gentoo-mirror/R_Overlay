		Finding the DNA and Protein Sequences of Any Genomic or Proteomic
		Loci // Using the DNA sequence and gene annotation files
		provided in 'ENSEMBL' https://www.ensembl.org/index.html, the
		functions implemented in the package try to find the DNA
		sequences and protein sequences of any given genomic loci, and
		to find the genomic coordinates and protein sequences of any
		given protein locations, which are the frequent tasks in the
		analysis of genomic and proteomic data.
