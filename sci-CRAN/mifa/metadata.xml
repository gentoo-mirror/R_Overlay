		Multiple Imputation for Exploratory Factor Analysis // Impute the
		covariance matrix of incomplete data so that factor analysis
		can be performed. Imputations are made using multiple
		imputation by Multivariate Imputation with Chained Equations
		(MICE) and combined with Rubin's rules. Parametric Fieller
		confidence intervals and nonparametric bootstrap confidence
		intervals can be obtained for the variance explained by
		different numbers of principal components. The method is
		described in Nassiri et al. (2018)
