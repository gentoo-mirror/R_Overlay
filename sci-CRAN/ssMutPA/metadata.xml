		Single-Sample Mutation-Based Pathway Analysis // A systematic
		bioinformatics tool to perform single-sample mutation-based
		pathway analysis by integrating somatic mutation data with the
		Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. In this method, we
		use local and global weighted strategies to evaluate the
		effects of network genes from mutations according to the
		network topology and then calculate the mutation-based pathway
		enrichment score (ssMutPES) to reflect the accumulated effect
		of mutations of each pathway. Subsequently, the ssMutPES
		profiles are used for unsupervised spectral clustering to
		identify cancer subtypes.
