		C++ Implementations of Phylogenetic Cladogenesis Calculations //
		Various cladogenesis-related calculations that are slow in pure
		R are implemented in C++ with Rcpp. These include the
		calculation of the probability of various scenarios for the
		inheritance of geographic range at the divergence events on a
		phylogenetic tree, and other calculations necessary for models
		which are not continuous-time markov chains (CTMC), but where
		change instead occurs instantaneously at speciation events.
		Typically these models must assess the probability of every
		possible combination of (ancestor state, left descendent state,
		right descendent state).  This means that there are up to (# of
		states)^3 combinations to investigate, and in biogeographical
		models, there can easily be hundreds of states, so calculation
		time becomes an issue.  C++ implementation plus clever tricks
		(many combinations can be eliminated a priori) can greatly
		speed the computation time over naive R implementations.
