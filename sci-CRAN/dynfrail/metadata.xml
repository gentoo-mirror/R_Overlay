		Fitting Dynamic Frailty Models with the EM Algorithm // Fits
		semiparametric dynamic frailty models according to the
		methodology of Putter and van Houwelingen (2015)
		doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv002. Intermediate models, where
		the frailty is piecewise constant on prespecified intervals,
		are also supported. The frailty process is taken to have a
		specific auto-correlation structure, and the supported
		distributions include gamma, inverse Gaussian, power variance
		family (PVF) and positive stable.
