		Varying Coefficient Meta-Analysis // Implements functions for
		varying coefficient meta-analysis methods. These methods do not
		assume effect size homogeneity. Subgroup effect size
		comparisons, general linear effect size contrasts, and linear
		models of effect sizes based on varying coefficient methods can
		be used to describe effect size heterogeneity. Varying
		coefficient meta-analysis methods do not require the
		unrealistic assumptions of the traditional fixed-effect and
		random-effects meta-analysis methods. For details see:
		Statistical Methods for Psychologists, Volume 5,
