		Blocked Weighted Bootstrap // The blocked weighted bootstrap
		(BBW) is an estimation technique for use with data from two-
		stage cluster sampled surveys in which either prior weighting
		(e.g. population-proportional sampling or PPS as used in
		Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and
		Transitions or SMART surveys) or posterior weighting (e.g. as
		used in rapid assessment method or RAM and simple spatial
		sampling method or S3M surveys) is implemented. See Cameron et
		al (2008) doi:10.1162/rest.90.3.414 for application of
		bootstrap to cluster samples. See Aaron et al (2016)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0163176 and Aaron et al (2016)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0162462 for application of the blocked
		weighted bootstrap to estimate indicators from two-stage
		cluster sampled surveys.
