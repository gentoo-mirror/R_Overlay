		Perform Rosenbaum Bounds Sensitivity Tests for Matched and
		Unmatched Data // Takes matched and unmatched data and
		calculates Rosenbaum bounds for the treatment effect.
		Calculates bounds for binary outcome data, Hodges-Lehmann point
		estimates, Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched data and
		matched IV estimators, Wilcoxon sum rank test, and for data
		with multiple matched controls. The sensitivity analysis
		methods in this package are documented in Rosenbaum (2002)
