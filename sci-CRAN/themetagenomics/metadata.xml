		Exploring Thematic Structure and Predicted Functionality of 16s
		rRNA Amplicon Data // A means to explore the structure of 16S
		rRNA surveys using a Structural Topic Model coupled with
		functional prediction. The user provides an abundance table,
		sample metadata, and taxonomy information, and themetagenomics
		infers associations between topics and sample features, as well
		as topics and predicted functional content. Functional
		prediction can be accomplished via Tax4Fun (for Silva
		references) and PICRUSt (for GreenGeenes references).
