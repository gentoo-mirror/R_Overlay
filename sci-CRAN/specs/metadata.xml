		Single-Equation Penalized Error-Correction Selector (SPECS) //
		Implementation of SPECS, your favourite Single-Equation
		Penalized Error-Correction Selector developed in Smeekes and
		Wijler (2020) arXiv:1809.08889. SPECS provides a fully
		automated estimation procedure for large and potentially
		(co)integrated datasets. The dataset in levels is converted to
		a conditional error-correction model, either by the user or by
		means of the functions included in this package, and various
		specialised forms of penalized regression can be applied to the
		model. Automated options for initializing and selecting a
		sequence of penalties, as well as the construction of penalty
		weights via an initial estimator, are available. Moreover, the
		user may choose from a number of pre-specified deterministic
		configurations to further simplify the model building process.
