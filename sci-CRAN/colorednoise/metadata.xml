		Simulate Temporally Autocorrelated Population Time Series //
		Temporally autocorrelated populations are correlated in their
		vital rates (growth, death, etc.) from year to year. It is very
		common for populations, whether they be bacteria, plants, or
		humans, to be temporally autocorrelated. This poses a challenge
		for stochastic population modeling, because a temporally
		correlated population will behave differently from an
		uncorrelated one. This package provides tools for simulating
		populations with white noise (no temporal autocorrelation), red
		noise (positive temporal autocorrelation), and blue noise
		(negative temporal autocorrelation).  The algebraic formulation
		for autocorrelated noise comes from Ruokolainen et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1016/j.tree.2009.04.009. The simulations are based on an
		assumption of an asexually reproducing population, but it can
		also be used to simulate females of a sexually reproducing
		species.
