		Irrepresentable Condition Check // Check the irrepresentable
		condition (IRC) in both L1-regularized regression
		doi:10.1109/TIT.2006.883611 and Gaussian graphical models. The
		IRC requires that the important and unimportant variables are
		not correlated, at least not all that much, and it is necessary
		for consistent model selection. Exploring the IRC as a function
		of the number of variables, assumed sparsity, and effect size
		can provide valuable insights into the model selection
		properties of L1-regularization.
