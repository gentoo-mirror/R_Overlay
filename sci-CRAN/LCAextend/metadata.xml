		Latent Class Analysis (LCA) with Familial Dependence in Extended
		Pedigrees // Latent Class Analysis of phenotypic measurements
		in pedigrees and model selection based on one of two methods:
		likelihood-based cross-validation and Bayesian Information
		Criterion. Computation of individual and triplet child-parents
		weights in a pedigree is performed using an upward-downward
		algorithm. The model takes into account the familial dependence
		defined by the pedigree structure by considering that a class
		of a child depends on his parents classes via triplet-
		transition probabilities of the classes. The package handles
		the case where measurements are available on all subjects and
		the case where measurements are available only on symptomatic
		(i.e. affected) subjects. Distributions for discrete (or
		ordinal) and continuous data are currently implemented. The
		package can deal with missing data.
