		Analyse GPS Data // Analyse location data such as latitude,
		longitude, and elevation. Based on spherical trigonometry,
		variables such as speed, bearing, and distances can be
		calculated from moment to moment, depending on the sampling
		frequency of the equipment used, and independent of scale.
		Additionally, the package can plot tracks, coordinates, and
		shapes on maps, and sub-tracks can be selected with point-in-
		polygon or other techniques. The package is optimized to
		support behavioural science experiments with multiple tracks.
		It can detect and clean up errors in the data, and resulting
		data can be exported to be analysed in statistical software or
		geographic information systems (GIS).
