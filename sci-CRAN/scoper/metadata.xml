		Spectral Clustering-Based Method for Identifying B Cell Clones //
		Provides a computational framework for B cell clones
		identification from adaptive immune receptor repertoire
		sequencing (AIRR-Seq) datasets. Three models are included
		(identical, hierarchical, and spectral) that perform clustering
		among sequences of BCRs/IGs (B cell receptors/immunoglobulins)
		which share the same V gene, J gene and junction length. Nouri
		N and Kleinstein SH (2018) doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty235.
