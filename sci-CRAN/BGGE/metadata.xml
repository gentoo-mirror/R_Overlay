		Bayesian Genomic Linear Models Applied to GE Genome Selection //
		Application of genome prediction for a continuous variable,
		focused on genotype by environment (GE) genomic selection
		models (GS). It consists a group of functions that help to
		create regression kernels for some GE genomic models proposed
		by Jarqun et al. (2014) doi:10.1007/s00122-013-2243-1 and
		Lopez-Cruz et al. (2015) doi:10.1534/g3.114.016097. Also, it
		computes genomic predictions based on Bayesian approaches. The
		prediction function uses an orthogonal transformation of the
		data and specific priors present by Cuevas et al. (2014)
		doi:10.1534/g3.114.013094.
