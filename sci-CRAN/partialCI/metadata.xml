		Partial Cointegration // A collection of time series is partially
		cointegrated if a linear combination of these time series can
		be found so that the residual spread is partially
		autoregressive - meaning that it can be represented as a sum of
		an autoregressive series and a random walk. This concept is
		useful in modeling certain sets of financial time series and
		beyond, as it allows for the spread to contain transient and
		permanent components alike. Partial cointegration has been
		introduced by Clegg and Krauss (2016)
		https://hdl.handle.net/10419/140632, along with a large-scale
		empirical application to financial market data. The partialCI
		package comprises estimation, testing, and simulation routines
		for partial cointegration models in state space. Clegg et al.
		(2017) https://hdl.handle.net/10419/150014 provide an in in-
		depth discussion of the package functionality as well as
		illustrating examples in the fields of finance and
		macroeconomics.
