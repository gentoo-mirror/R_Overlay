		Computational Geometry // R interface to (some of) cddlib
		(https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib). Converts back and forth
		between two representations of a convex polytope: as solution
		of a set of linear equalities and inequalities and as convex
		hull of set of points and rays. Also does linear programming
		and redundant generator elimination (for example, convex hull
		in n dimensions).  All functions can use exact infinite-
		precision rational arithmetic.
