		Computational Geometry // R interface to (some of) cddlib
		(http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~fukuda/cdd_home/cdd.html).
		Converts back and forth between two representations of a convex
		polytope: as solution of a set of linear equalities and
		inequalities and as convex hull of set of points and rays. Also
		does linear programming and redundant generator elimination
		(for example, convex hull in n dimensions).  All functions can
		use exact infinite-precision rational arithmetic.
