		Compensation Analysis Tool for Instructor Overload Pay //
		Calculates equitable overload compensation for college
		instructors based on institutional policies, enrollment
		thresholds, and regular teaching load limits. Compensation is
		awarded only for credit hours that exceed the regular load and
		meet minimum enrollment criteria. When enrollment is below a
		specified threshold, pay is prorated accordingly. The package
		prioritizes compensation from high-enrollment courses, or
		optionally from low-enrollment courses for fairness, depending
		on user-defined strategy. Includes tools for flexible policy
		settings, instructor filtering, and produces clean, audit-ready
		summary tables suitable for payroll and administrative
		reporting.
