		Interactive Graphics for Portfolio Data // Creates an interactive
		graphics interface to visualize backtest results of different
		financial instruments, such as equities, futures, and credit
		default swaps. The package does not run backtests on the given
		data set but displays a graphical explanation of the backtest
		results. Users can look at backtest graphics for different
		instruments, investment strategies, and portfolios. Summary
		statistics of different portfolio holdings are shown in the
		left panel, and interactive plots of profit and loss (P\L), net
		market value (NMV) and gross market value (GMV) are displayed
		in the right panel.
