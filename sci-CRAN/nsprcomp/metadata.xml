		Non-Negative and Sparse PCA // Two methods for performing a
		constrained principal component analysis (PCA), where non-
		negativity and/or sparsity constraints are enforced on the
		principal axes (PAs). The function 'nsprcomp' computes one
		principal component (PC) after the other. Each PA is optimized
		such that the corresponding PC has maximum additional variance
		not explained by the previous components. In contrast, the
		function 'nscumcomp' jointly computes all PCs such that the
		cumulative variance is maximal. Both functions have the same
		interface as the 'prcomp' function from the 'stats' package
		(plus some extra parameters), and both return the result of the
		analysis as an object of class 'nsprcomp', which inherits from
		'prcomp'. See https://sigg-
		iten.ch/learningbits/2013/05/27/nsprcomp-is-on-cran/ and Sigg
		et al. (2008) doi:10.1145/1390156.1390277 for more details.
