		Integrative Lasso with Penalty Factors // The core of the package
		is cvr2.ipflasso(), an extension of glmnet to be used when the
		(large) set of available predictors is partitioned into several
		modalities which potentially differ with respect to their
		information content in terms of prediction. For example, in
		biomedical applications patient outcome such as survival time
		or response to therapy may have to be predicted based on, say,
		mRNA data, miRNA data, methylation data, CNV data, clinical
		data, etc. The clinical predictors are on average often much
		more important for outcome prediction than the mRNA data. The
		ipflasso method takes this problem into account by using
		different penalty parameters for predictors from different
		modalities. The ratio between the different penalty parameters
		can be chosen by cross-validation.
