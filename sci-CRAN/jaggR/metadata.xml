		Supporting Files and Functions for the Book Bayesian Modelling
		with 'JAGS' // All the data and functions used to produce the
		book. We do not expect most people to use the package for any
		other reason than to get simple access to the 'JAGS' model
		files, the data, and perhaps run some of the simple examples.
		The authors of the book are David Lucy (now sadly deceased) and
		James Curran. It is anticipated that a manuscript will be
		provided to Taylor and Francis around February 2020, with
		bibliographic details to follow at that point. Until such time,
		further information can be obtained by emailing James Curran.
