		Fitting Mixed (Inflated and Adjusted) Distributions // This is an
		add-on package to 'gamlss'. The purpose of this package is to
		allow users to fit GAMLSS (Generalised Additive Models for
		Location Scale and Shape) models when the response variable is
		defined either in the intervals [0,1), (0,1] and [0,1]
		(inflated at zero and/or one distributions), or in the positive
		real line including zero (zero-adjusted distributions). The
		mass points at zero and/or one are treated as extra parameters
		with the possibility to include a linear predictor for both.
		The package also allows transformed or truncated distributions
		from the GAMLSS family to be used for the continuous part of
		the distribution. Standard methods and GAMLSS diagnostics can
		be used with the resulting fitted object.
