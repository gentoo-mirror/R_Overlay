		Classify Open Street Map Features // Classify Open Street Map
		(OSM) features into meaningful functional or analytical
		categories. Designed for OSM PBF files, e.g. from
		https://download.geofabrik.de/ imported as spatial data frames.
		A classification consists of a list of categories that are
		related to certain OSM tags and values. Given a layer from an
		OSM PBF file and a classification, the main osm_classify()
		function returns a classification data table giving, for each
		feature, the primary and alternative categories (if there is
		overlap) assigned, and the tag(s) and value(s) matched on. The
		package also contains a classification of OSM features by
		economic function/significance, following Krantz (2023)
		https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4537867.
