		Analytic Element Modeling of Steady Single-Layer Groundwater Flow
		// A model of single-layer groundwater flow in steady-state
		under the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption can be created by
		placing elements such as wells, area-sinks and line-sinks at
		arbitrary locations in the flow field. Output variables include
		hydraulic head and the discharge vector. Particle traces can be
		computed numerically in three dimensions. The underlying theory
		is described in Haitjema (1995)
		doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-316550-3.X5000-4 and references therein.
