		Generalized Linear Models Adjusting for Misrepresentation // Fit
		Generalized Linear Models to continuous and count outcomes, as
		well as estimate the prevalence of misrepresentation of an
		important binary predictor. Misrepresentation typically arises
		when there is an incentive for the binary factor to be
		misclassified in one direction (e.g., in insurance settings
		where policy holders may purposely deny a risk status in order
		to lower the insurance premium). This is accomplished by
		treating a subset of the response variable as resulting from a
		mixture distribution. Model parameters are estimated via the
		Expectation Maximization algorithm and standard errors of the
		estimates are obtained from closed forms of the Observed Fisher
		Information. For an introduction to the models and the
		misrepresentation framework, see Xia et. al., (2023)
		https://variancejournal.org/article/73151-maximum-likelihood-
		approaches-to-misrepresentation-models-in-glm-ratemaking-model-
		comparisons.
