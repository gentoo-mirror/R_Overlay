		Expectation-Maximization Binary Clustering // Unsupervised,
		multivariate, binary clustering for meaningful annotation of
		data, taking into account the uncertainty in the data. A
		specific constructor for trajectory analysis in movement
		ecology yields behavioural annotation of trajectories based on
		estimated local measures of velocity and turning angle,
		eventually with solar position covariate as a daytime
		indicator, ("Expectation-Maximization Binary Clustering for
		Behavioural Annotation").
