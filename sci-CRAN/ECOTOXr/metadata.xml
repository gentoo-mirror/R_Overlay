		Download and Extract Data from US EPA's ECOTOX Database // The US
		EPA ECOTOX database is a freely available database with a
		treasure of aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicological data. As
		the online search interface doesn't come with an API, this
		package provides the means to easily access and search the
		database in R. To this end, all raw tables are downloaded from
		the EPA website and stored in a local SQLite database
