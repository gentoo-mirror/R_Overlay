		Strided Iterator and Range // The strided iterator adapts
		multidimensional buffers to work with the C++ standard library
		and range-based for-loops. Given a pointer or iterator into a
		multidimensional data buffer, one can generate an iterator
		range using make_strided to construct strided versions of the
		standard library's begin and end. For constructing range-based
		for-loops, a strided_range class is provided. These help
		authors avoid integer-based indexing, which in some cases can
		impede algorithm performance and introduce indexing errors.
		This library exists primarily to expose the header file to
		other R projects.
