		Two-Stage Least-Squares Regression with Diagnostics //
		Instrumental variable estimation for linear models by two-stage
		least-squares (2SLS) regression. The main ivreg() model-fitting
		function is designed to provide a workflow as similar as
		possible to standard lm() regression. A wide range of methods
		is provided for fitted ivreg model objects, including extensive
		functionality for computing and graphing regression diagnostics
		in addition to other standard model tools.
