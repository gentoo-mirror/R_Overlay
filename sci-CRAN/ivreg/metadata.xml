		Instrumental-Variables Regression by '2SLS', '2SM', or '2SMM',
		with Diagnostics // Instrumental variable estimation for linear
		models by two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression or by
		robust-regression via M-estimation (2SM) or MM-estimation
		(2SMM). The main ivreg() model-fitting function is designed to
		provide a workflow as similar as possible to standard lm()
		regression. A wide range of methods is provided for fitted
		ivreg model objects, including extensive functionality for
		computing and graphing regression diagnostics in addition to
		other standard model tools.
