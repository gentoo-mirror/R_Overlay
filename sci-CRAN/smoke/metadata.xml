		Small Molecule Octet/BLI Kinetics Experiment // Bio-Layer
		Interferometry (BLI) is a technology to determine the binding
		kinetics between biomolecule. BLI signals are small and noisy
		when small molecule ligands are investigated. We develop this
		package to process and analyze the BLI data acquired on Octet
		Red96 (Fortebio) more accurately.
