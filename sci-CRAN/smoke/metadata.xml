		Small Molecule Octet/BLI Kinetics Experiment // Bio-Layer
		Interferometry (BLI) is a technology to determine the binding
		kinetics between biomolecules. BLI signals are small and noisy
		when small molecules are investigated as ligands (analytes). We
		develop this package to process and analyze the BLI data
		acquired on Octet Red96 from Fortebio more accurately. Sun Q.,
		Li X., et al (2020) doi:10.1038/s41467-019-14238-3. In this new
		version, we organize the BLI experiment data and analysis
		methods into a S4 class with self-explaining structure.
