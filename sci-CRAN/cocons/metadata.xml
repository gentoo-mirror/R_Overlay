		Covariate-Based Covariance Functions for Nonstationary Spatial
		Modeling // Estimation, prediction, and simulation of
		nonstationary Gaussian process with modular covariate-based
		covariance functions. Sources of nonstationarity, such as
		spatial mean, variance, geometric anisotropy, smoothness, and
		nugget, can be considered based on spatial characteristics. An
		induced compact-supported nonstationary covariance function is
		provided, enabling fast and memory-efficient computations when
		handling densely sampled domains.
