		Evolutionary Monte Carlo (EMC) Methods for Clustering //
		Evolutionary Monte Carlo methods for clustering, temperature
		ladder construction and placement. This package implements
		methods introduced in Goswami, Liu and Wong (2007)
		doi:10.1198/106186007X255072. The paper above introduced
		probabilistic genetic-algorithm-style crossover moves for
		clustering. The paper applied the algorithm to several
		clustering problems including Bernoulli clustering, biological
		sequence motif clustering, BIC based variable selection,
		mixture of Normals clustering, and showed that the proposed
		algorithm performed better both as a sampler and as a
		stochastic optimizer than the existing tools, namely, Gibbs
		sampling, ``split-merge'' Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,
		K-means clustering, and the MCLUST algorithm (in the package
		'mclust').
