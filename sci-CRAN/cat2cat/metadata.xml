		Handling an Inconsistently Coded Categorical Variable in a Panel
		Dataset // Unifying of an inconsistently coded categorical
		variable between two different time points in accordance with a
		mapping table. The main rule is to replicate the observation if
		it could be assign to a few categories. Then using simple
		frequencies or statistical methods to approximate probabilities
		of being assign to each of them. This procedure was invented
		and implemented in the paper by (Nasinski, Majchrowska and
		Broniatowska (2020) doi:10.24425/cejeme.2020.134747).
