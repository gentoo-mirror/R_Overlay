		Mapping of a Categorical Variable in a Panel Dataset // There are
		offered automatic methods to map a categorical variable
		according to a specific encoding across different time points.
		The main rule is to replicate the observation if it could be
		assign to a few categories. Then using simple frequencies or
		statistical methods to approximate probabilities of being
		assign to each of them. This algorithm was invented and
		implemented in the paper by (Nasinski, Majchrowska and
		Broniatowska (2020) doi:10.24425/cejeme.2020.134747).
