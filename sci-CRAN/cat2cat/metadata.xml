		Handling an Inconsistently Coded Categorical Variable in a
		Longitudinal Dataset // Unifying an inconsistently coded
		categorical variable between two different time points in
		accordance with a mapping table. The main rule is to replicate
		the observation if it could be assigned to a few categories.
		Then using frequencies or statistical methods to approximate
		the probabilities of being assigned to each of them. This
		procedure was invented and implemented in the paper by
		Nasinski, Majchrowska, and Broniatowska (2020)
