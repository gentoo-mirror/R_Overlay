		Linear p-Wasserstein Projections // Performs Wasserstein
		projections from the predictive distributions of any model into
		the space of predictive distributions of linear models. We
		utilize L1 penalties to also reduce the complexity of the model
		space. This package employs the methods as described in
		Dunipace, Eric and Lorenzo Trippa (2020) arXiv:2012.09999.
