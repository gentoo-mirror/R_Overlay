		Matrix Computation Based Identification of Prime Implicants //
		Computes the prime implicants or a minimal disjunctive normal
		form for a logic expression presented by a truth table or a
		logic tree. Has been particularly developed for logic
		expressions resulting from a logic regression analysis, i.e.
		logic expressions typically consisting of up to 16 literals,
		where the prime implicants are typically composed of a maximum
		of 4 or 5 literals.
