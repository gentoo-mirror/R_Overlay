		Archaeological Synchronism // Estimation of unknown historical or
		archaeological dates subject to relationships with other
		relative dates and absolute constraints, derived as marginal
		densities from the full joint conditional, using a two-stage
		Gibbs sampler with consistent batch means to assess
		convergence. Features reporting on Monte Carlo standard errors,
		as well as tools for rule-based estimation of dates of
		production and use of artifact types, aligning and checking
		relative sequences, and evaluating the impact of the omission
		of relative/absolute events upon one another.
