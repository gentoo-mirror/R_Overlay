		Bayesian Mode Inference // A two-step Bayesian approach for mode
		inference following Cross, Hoogerheide, Labonne and van Dijk
		(2024) doi:10.1016/j.econlet.2024.111579). First, a mixture
		distribution is fitted on the data using a sparse finite
		mixture (SFM) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The
		number of mixture components does not have to be known; the
		size of the mixture is estimated endogenously through the SFM
		approach. Second, the modes of the estimated mixture at each
		MCMC draw are retrieved using algorithms specifically tailored
		for mode detection. These estimates are then used to construct
		posterior probabilities for the number of modes, their
		locations and uncertainties, providing a powerful tool for mode
		inference.
