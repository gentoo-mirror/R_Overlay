		Bayesian Mode Inference // A Bayesian approach for mode inference
		which works in two steps. First, a mixture distribution is
		fitted on the data using a sparse finite mixture (SFM) Markov
		chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm following Malsiner-Walli,
		Frhwirth-Schnatter and Grn (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-014-9500-2). The number of mixture
		components does not have to be known; the size of the mixture
		is estimated endogenously through the SFM approach. Second, the
		modes of the estimated mixture at each MCMC draw are retrieved
		using algorithms specifically tailored for mode detection.
		These estimates are then used to construct posterior
		probabilities for the number of modes, their locations and
		uncertainties, providing a powerful tool for mode inference.
