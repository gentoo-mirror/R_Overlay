		Testing and Detecting Multimodality using Bayesian Methods // The
		testing approach works in two stages. First, a mixture
		distribution is fitted on the data using a Sparse Finite
		Mixture (SFM) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
		following Malsiner-Walli, Frhwirth-Schnatter and Grn (2016)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-014-9500-2). The number of mixture
		components does not have to be specified; it is estimated
		simultaneously with the mixture weights and components through
		the SFM approach. Second, the resulting MCMC output is used to
		calculate the number of modes and their locations following
		Basturk, Hoogerheide and van Dijk (2021)
		doi:10.2139/ssrn.3783351. Posterior probabilities are retrieved
		for both of these quantities providing a powerful tool for mode
		inference. Currently the package supports a flexible mixture of
		shifted Poisson distributions (see Basturk, Hoogerheide and van
		Dijk (2021) doi:10.2139/ssrn.3783351).
