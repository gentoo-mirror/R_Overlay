		Using Tip Dates with Phylogenetic Trees in BEAST // Assists
		performing tip-dating of phylogenetic trees with BEAST BEAST is
		a popular software for phylogenetic analysis. The package
		assists the implementation of various phylogenetic tip- dating
		tests using BEAST. It contains two main functions. The first
		one allows preparing date randomization analyses, which assess
		the temporal signal of a data set. The second function allows
		performing leave-one-out analyses, which test for the
		consistency between independent calibration sequences and allow
		pinpointing those leading to potential bias. The included
		tutorial provides detailed step-by-step instructions. An
		expanded description of the package can be found in article:
		Rieux, A. and Khatchikian, C.E. (2017), TIPDATINGBEAST: an R
		package to assist the implementation of phylogenetic tip-dating
		tests using BEAST. Molecular Ecology Resources, 17: 608-613.
