		Calculating Multiple Performance Metrics of a Prediction Model //
		Provides a function to calculate multiple performance metrics
		for actual and predicted values. In total eight metrics will be
		calculated for particular actual and predicted series. Helps to
		describe a Statistical model's performance in predicting a
		data. Also helps to compare various models' performance. The
		metrics are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Relative Root Mean
		Squared Error (RRMSE), Mean absolute Error (MAE), Mean absolute
		percentage error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE),
		Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Willmotts Index (WI), and
		Legates and McCabe Index (LME). Among them, first five are
		expected to be lesser whereas, the last three are greater the
		better. More details can be found from Garai and Paul (2023)
