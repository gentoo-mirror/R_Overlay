		A Pipeline to Define Gene Families in Legumes and Beyond // A
		pipeline with high specificity and sensitivity in extracting
		proteins from the RefSeq database (National Center for
		Biotechnology Information). Manual identification of gene
		families is highly time-consuming and laborious, requiring an
		iterative process of manual and computational analysis to
		identify members of a given family. The pipelines implements an
		automatic approach for the identification of gene families
		based on the conserved domains that specifically define that
		family. See Die et al. (2018) doi:10.1101/436659 for more
		information and examples.
