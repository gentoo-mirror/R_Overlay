		Statistical Inference via Lancaster Correlation // Implementation
		of the methods described in Holzmann, Klar (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2303.17872. Lancaster correlation is a
		correlation coefficient which equals the absolute value of the
		Pearson correlation for the bivariate normal distribution, and
		is equal to or slightly less than the maximum correlation
		coefficient for a variety of bivariate distributions. Rank and
		moment-based estimators and corresponding confidence intervals
		are implemented, as well as independence tests based on these
		statistics.
