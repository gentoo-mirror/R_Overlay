		Statistical Inference via Lancaster Correlation // Implementation
		of the methods described in Holzmann, Klar (2024) doi:
		10.1111/sjos.12733. Lancaster correlation is a correlation
		coefficient which equals the absolute value of the Pearson
		correlation for the bivariate normal distribution, and is equal
		to or slightly less than the maximum correlation coefficient
		for a variety of bivariate distributions. Rank and moment-based
		estimators and corresponding confidence intervals are
		implemented, as well as independence tests based on these
		statistics.
