		Terribly-Simple Data Base for Time Series // A terribly-simple
		data base for numeric time series, written purely in R, so no
		external database-software is needed. Series are stored in
		plain-text files (the most-portable and enduring file type) in
		CSV format. Timestamps are encoded using R's native numeric
		representation for 'Date'/'POSIXct', which makes them fast to
		parse, but keeps them accessible with other software. The
		package provides tools for saving and updating series in this
		standardised format, for retrieving and joining data, for
		summarising files and directories, and for coercing series from
		and to other data types (such as 'zoo' series).
