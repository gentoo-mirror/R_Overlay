		Fits the Bradley-Terry Model to Potentially Large and Sparse
		Networks of Comparison Data // Facilities are provided for
		fitting the simple, unstructured Bradley-Terry model to
		networks of binary comparisons. The implemented methods are
		designed to scale well to large, potentially sparse, networks.
		A fairly high degree of scalability is achieved through the use
		of EM and MM algorithms, which are relatively undemanding in
		terms of memory usage (relative to some other commonly used
		methods such as iterative weighted least squares, for example).
		Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian MAP estimation methods are
		implemented. The package provides various standard methods for
		a newly defined 'btfit' model class, such as the extraction and
		summarisation of model parameters and the simulation of new
		datasets from a fitted model. Tools are also provided for
		reshaping data into the newly defined "btdata" class, and for
		analysing the comparison network, prior to fitting the Bradley-
		Terry model. This package complements, rather than replaces,
		the existing 'BradleyTerry2' package. (BradleyTerry2 has rather
		different aims, which are mainly the specification and fitting
		of "structured" Bradley-Terry models in which the strength
		parameters depend on covariates.)
