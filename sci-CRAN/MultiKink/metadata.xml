		Estimation and Inference for Multi-Kink Quantile Regression //
		Estimation and inference for multiple kink quantile regression.
		A bootstrap restarting iterative segmented quantile algorithm
		is proposed to estimate the multiple kink quantile regression
		model conditional on a given number of change points. The
		number of kinks is also allowed to be unknown. In such case,
		the backward elimination algorithm and the bootstrap restarting
		iterative segmented quantile algorithm are combined to select
		the number of change points based on a quantile BIC. A score-
		type based test statistic is also developed for testing the
		existence of kink effect. The package is based on the paper,
		"Wei Zhong, Chuang Wan and Wenyang Zhang (2020). Estimation and
		inference for multi-kink quantile regression, submitted".
