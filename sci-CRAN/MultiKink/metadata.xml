		Estimation and Inference for Multi-Kink Quantile Regression //
		Estimation and inference for multiple kink quantile regression
		for longitudinal data and the i.i.d data. A bootstrap
		restarting iterative segmented quantile algorithm is proposed
		to estimate the multiple kink quantile regression model
		conditional on a given number of change points. The number of
		kinks is also allowed to be unknown. In such case, the backward
		elimination algorithm and the bootstrap restarting iterative
		segmented quantile algorithm are combined to select the number
		of change points based on a quantile BIC. For longitudinal
		data, we also develop the GEE estimator to incorporate the
		within-subject correlations.  A score-type based test statistic
		is also developed for testing the existence of kink effect. The
		package is based on the paper, ``Wei Zhong, Chuang Wan and
		Wenyang Zhang (2022). Estimation and inference for multikink
		quantile regression, JBES'' and ``Chuang Wan, Wei Zhong,
		Wenyang Zhang and Changliang Zou (2022). Multi-kink quantile
		regression for longitudinal data with application to
		progesterone data analysis, Biometrics".
