		Access Forest Ecology Layers for British Columbia in 2001-2018 //
		R-based access to a large set of data variables relevant to
		forest ecology in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Layers are in
		raster format at 100m resolution in the BC Albers projection,
		hosted at the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) with
		doi:10.20383/101.0283. The collection includes: elevation;
		biogeoclimatic zone; wildfire; cutblocks; forest attributes
		from Hansen et al. (2013) doi:10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401 and
		Beaudoin et al. (2017) doi:10.1139/cjfr-2017-0184; and
		rasterized Forest Insect and Disease Survey (FIDS) maps for a
		number of insect pest species, all covering the period
		2001-2018. Users supply a polygon or point location in the
		province of BC, and 'rasterbc' will download the overlapping
		raster tiles hosted at FRDR, merging them as needed and
		returning the result in R as a 'SpatRaster' object. Metadata
		associated with these layers, and code for downloading them
		from their original sources can be found in the 'github'
		repository https://github.com/deankoch/rasterbc_src.
