		Acoustic Scattering for Complex Shapes by Using the DWBA // Uses
		the Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA) to compute the
		acoustic backward scattering, the geometry of the object is
		formed by a volumetric mesh, composed of tetrahedrons. This
		computation is done efficiently through an analytical 3D
		integration that allows for a solution which is expressed in
		terms of elementary functions for each tetrahedron. It is
		important to note that this method is only valid for objects
		whose acoustic properties, such as density and sound speed, do
		not vary significantly compared to the surrounding medium.
