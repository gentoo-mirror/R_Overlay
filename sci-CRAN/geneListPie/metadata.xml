		Profiling a gene list into GOslim or KEGG function pie //
		"geneListPie" package is for mapping a gene list to function
		categories defined in GOSlim or Kegg. The results can be
		plotted as a pie chart to provide a quick view of the genes
		distribution of the gene list among the function categories.
		The gene list must contain a list of gene symbols. The package
		contains a set of pre-processed gene sets obtained from Gene
		Ontology and MSigDB including human, mouse, rat and yeast. To
		provide a high level concise view, only GO slim and kegg are
		provided. The gene sets are regulared updated. User can also
		use customized gene sets. User can use the R Pie() or Pie3D()
		function for plotting the pie chart. Users can also choose to
		output the gene function mapping results and use external
		software such as Excel(R) for ploting.
