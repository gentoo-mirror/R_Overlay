		Measuring Functional Diversity (FD) from Multiple Traits, and
		Other Tools for Functional Ecology // Computes different
		multidimensional FD indices.  Implements a distance-based
		framework to measure FD that allows any number and type of
		functional traits, and can also consider species relative
		abundances.  Also contains other useful tools for functional
		ecology.
