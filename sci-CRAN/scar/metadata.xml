		Shape-Constrained Additive Regression: a Maximum Likelihood
		Approach // Computes the maximum likelihood estimator of the
		generalised additive and index regression with shape
		constraints. Each additive component function is assumed to
		obey one of the nine possible shape restrictions: linear,
		increasing, decreasing, convex, convex increasing, convex
		decreasing, concave, concave increasing, or concave decreasing.
