		Adaptive Dynamics and Community Matrix Model Projections // Runs
		projections of groups of matrix projection models (MPMs),
		allowing density dependence mechanisms to work across MPMs.
		This package was developed to run both adaptive dynamics
		simulations such as pairwise and multiple invasibility
		analyses, and community projections in which species are
		represented by MPMs. All forms of MPMs are allowed, including
		integral projection models (IPMs). Also includes individual-
		based modeling (IBM) versions of these.
