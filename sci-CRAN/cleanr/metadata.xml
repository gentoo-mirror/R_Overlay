		Helps You to Code Cleaner // Check your R code for some of the
		most common layout flaws.  Many tried to teach us how to write
		code less dreadful, be it implicitly as B. W. Kernighan and D.
		M. Ritchie (1988) ISBN:0-13-110362-8 in 'The C Programming
		Language' did, be it explicitly as R.C. Martin (2008)
		ISBN:0-13-235088-2 in 'Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software
		Craftsmanship' did.  So we should check our code for files too
		long or wide, functions with too many lines, too wide lines,
		too many arguments or too many levels of nesting. Note: This is
		not a static code analyzer like pylint or the like. Checkout
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=lintr instead.
