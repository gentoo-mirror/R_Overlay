		Species-Habitat Associations // Analyse species-habitat
		associations in R. Therefore, information about the location of
		the species (as a point pattern) is needed together with
		environmental conditions (as a categorical raster). To test for
		significance habitat associations, one of the two components is
		randomized. Methods are mainly based on Plotkin et al. (2000)
		doi:10.1006/jtbi.2000.2158 and Harms et al. (2001)
