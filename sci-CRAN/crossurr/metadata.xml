		Cross-Fitting for Doubly Robust Evaluation of High-Dimensional
		Surrogate Markers // Doubly robust methods for evaluating
		surrogate markers as outlined in: Agniel D, Hejblum BP,
		Thiebaut R  Parast L (2022). "Doubly robust evaluation of high-
		dimensional surrogate markers", Biostatistics
		doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxac020. You can use these methods to
		determine how much of the overall treatment effect is explained
		by a (possibly high-dimensional) set of surrogate markers.
