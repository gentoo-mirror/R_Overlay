		Profile Likelihood for a Parameter in Commonly Used Statistical
		Models // Provides profile likelihoods for a parameter of
		interest in commonly used statistical models. The models
		include linear models, generalized linear models, proportional
		odds models, linear mixed-effects models, and linear models for
		longitudinal responses fitted by generalized least squares. The
		package also provides plots for normalized profile likelihoods
		as well as the maximum profile likelihood estimates and the kth
		likelihood support intervals.
