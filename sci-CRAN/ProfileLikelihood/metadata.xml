		Profile Likelihood for a Parameter in Commonly Used Statistical
		Models // This package provides profile likelihoods for a
		parameter of interest in commonly used statistical models. The
		models include linear models, generalized linear models,
		proportional odds models, linear mixed-effects models, and
		linear models for longitudinal responses fitted by generalized
		least squares. The package also provides plots for normalized
		profile likelihoods as well as the maximum profile likelihood
		estimates and the kth likelihood support intervals.
