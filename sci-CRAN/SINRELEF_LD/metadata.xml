		Reliability and Relative Efficiency in Locally-Dependent Measures
		// Implements an approach aimed at assessing the accuracy and
		effectiveness of raw scores obtained in scales that contain
		locally dependent items. The program uses as input the
		calibration (structural) item estimates obtained from fitting
		extended unidimensional factor-analytic solutions in which the
		existing local dependencies are included. Measures of
		reliability (Omega) and information are proposed at three
		levels: (a) total score, (b) bivariate-doublet, and (c) item-
		by-item deletion, and  are compared to those that would be
		obtained if all the items had been locally independent. All the
		implemented procedures can be obtained from: (a) linear factor-
		analytic solutions in which the item scores are treated as
		approximately continuous, and (b) non-linear solutions in which
		the item scores are treated as ordered-categorical.
