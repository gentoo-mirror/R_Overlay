		Creates Images Sized for Social Media // Creates images that are
		the proper size for social media. Beautiful plots, charts and
		graphs wither and die if they are not shared. Social media is
		perfect for this but every platform has its own image
		dimensions. With 'smpic' you can easily save your plots with
		the exact dimensions needed for the different platforms.
