		Build Decision Trees with Optimal Multivariate Splits //
		Functions for training an optimal decision tree classifier,
		making predictions and generating latex code for plotting.
		Works for two-class and multi-class classification problems.
		The algorithm seeks the optimal Boolean rule consisting of
		multiple variables to split a node, resulting in shorter trees.
		Use bsnsing() to build a tree, predict() to make predictions
		and plot() to plot the tree into latex and PDF. See Yanchao Liu
		(2022) arXiv:2205.15263 for technical details. Source code and
		more data sets are at https://github.com/profyliu/bsnsing/.
