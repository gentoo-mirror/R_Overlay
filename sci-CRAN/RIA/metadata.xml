		Radiomics Image Analysis Toolbox for Medial Images // Radiomics
		image analysis toolbox for 2D and 3D radiological images. RIA
		supports DICOM, NIfTI and nrrd file formats. RIA calculates
		first-order, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level run
		length matrix and geometry-based statistics. Almost all
		calculations are done using vectorized formulas to optimize run
		speeds. Calculation of several thousands of parameters only
		takes minutes on a single core of a conventional PC.
