		Deal with Dependencies // Tools to help manage dependencies
		during package development.  This can retrieve all dependencies
		that are used in R files in the "R" directory, in Rmd files in
		"vignettes" directory and in 'roxygen2' documentation of
		functions. There is a function to update the Description file
		of your package and a function to create a file with the R
		commands to install all dependencies of your package. All
		functions to retrieve dependencies of R scripts and Rmd files
		can be used independently of a package development.
