		Deal with Dependencies // Manage dependencies during package
		development. This can retrieve all dependencies that are used
		in ".R" files in the "R/" directory, in ".Rmd" files in
		"vignettes/" directory and in 'roxygen2' documentation of
		functions. There is a function to update the "DESCRIPTION" file
		of your package with 'CRAN' packages or any other remote
		package.  All functions to retrieve dependencies of ".R"
		scripts and ".Rmd" or ".qmd" files can be used independently of
		a package development.
