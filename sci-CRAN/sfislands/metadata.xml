		Streamlines the Process of Fitting Areal Spatial Models //
		Helpers for addressing the issue of disconnected spatial units.
		It allows for convenient adding and removal of neighbourhood
		connectivity between areal units prior to modelling, with the
		visual aid of maps. Post-modelling, it reduces the human
		workload for extracting, tidying and mapping predictions from
		areal models.
