		Nonparametric Double Additive Location-Scale Model (DALSM) // Fit
		of a double additive location-scale model with a nonparametric
		error distribution from possibly right- or interval censored
		data. The additive terms in the location and dispersion
		submodels, as well as the unknown error distribution in the
		location-scale model, are estimated using Laplace P-splines.
