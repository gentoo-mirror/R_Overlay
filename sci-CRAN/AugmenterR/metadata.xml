		Data Augmentation for Machine Learning on Tabular Data //
		Implementation of a data augmentation technique based on
		conditional entropy It was devised by both authors during their
		masters and is discussed in detail in the second author
		dissertation. It is able to create novel samples conditioned on
		a desired value of a categorical attribute, as a way to augment
		data for classification tasks Tests discussed in the
		dissertation and future paper present that the technique
		satisfies several statistical assumptions for the novel
		samples. It also shows significant improvement for machine
		learning models trained on small data.
