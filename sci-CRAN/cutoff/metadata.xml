		Seek the Significant Cutoff Value // Seek the significant cutoff
		value for a continuous variable, which will be transformed into
		a classification, for linear regression, logistic regression,
		logrank analysis and cox regression. First of all, all
		combinations will be gotten by combn() function. Then n.per
		argument, abbreviated of total number percentage, will be used
		to remove the combination of smaller data group. In logistic,
		Cox regression and logrank analysis, we will also use p.per
		argument, patient percentage, to filter the lower proportion of
		patients in each group. Finally, p value in regression results
		will be used to get the significant combinations and output
		relevant parameters. In this package, there is no limit to the
		number of cutoff points, which can be 1, 2, 3 or more. Still,
		we provide 2 methods, typical Bonferroni and Duglas G (1994)
		doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.11.829, to adjust the p value, Missing
		values will be deleted by na.omit() function before analysis.
