		Satellite Nightlight Data Extraction // Extracts raster and zonal
		statistics from satellite nightlight rasters downloaded from
		the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric
		Administration (http://www.noaa.gov) free data repositories.
		Both the DMSP-OLS annual and SNPP-VIIRS monthly nightlight
		raster data are supported. Satellite nightlight raster tiles
		are downloaded and cropped to the country boundaries using
		shapefiles from the GADM database of Global Administrative
		Areas (http://gadm.org). Zonal statistics are then calculated
		at the lowest administrative boundary for the selected country
		and cached locally for future retrieval. Finally, a simple data
		explorer/browser is included that allows one to visualize the
		cached data e.g. graphing, mapping and clustering regional
		data.
