		Characterizing Temporal Dysregulation // TEMPO (TEmporal Modeling
		of Pathway Outliers) is a pathway-based outlier detection
		approach for finding pathways showing significant changes in
		temporal expression patterns across conditions.  Given a gene
		expression data set where each sample is characterized by an
		age or time point as well as a phenotype (e.g. control or
		disease), and a collection of gene sets or pathways, TEMPO
		ranks each pathway by a score that characterizes how well a
		partial least squares regression (PLSR) model can predict age
		as a function of gene expression in the controls and how poorly
		that same model performs in the disease. TEMPO v1.0.3 is
		described in Pietras (2018) doi:10.1145/3233547.3233559.
