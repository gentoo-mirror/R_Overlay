		Joint Frailty-Copula Models for Tumour Progression and Death in
		Meta-Analysis // Perform likelihood estimation and dynamic
		prediction under joint frailty-copula models for tumour
		progression and death in meta-analysis. A penalized likelihood
		method is employed for estimating model parameters, where the
		baseline hazard functions are modeled by smoothing splines. The
		methods are applicable for meta-analytic data combining several
		studies. The methods can analyze data having information on
		both terminal event time (e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal
		event time (e.g., time-to-tumour progression). See Emura et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1177/0962280215604510 for likelihood estimation,
		and Emura et al. (2018) doi:10.1177/0962280216688032 for
		dynamic prediction. More details on these methods can also be
		found in a book of Emura et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1007/978-981-13-3516-7. Survival data from ovarian
		cancer patients are also available.
