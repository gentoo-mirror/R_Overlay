		Penalized Likelihood Estimation and Dynamic Prediction under the
		Joint Frailty-Copula Models Between Tumour Progression and
		Death for Meta-Analysis // Perform the Cox regression and
		dynamic prediction methods under the joint frailty-copula model
		between tumour progression and death for meta-analysis. A
		penalized likelihood is employed for estimating model
		parameters, where the baseline hazard functions are
		approximated by smoothing splines. The methods are applicable
		for meta-analytic data combining several studies. The methods
		can analyze data having information on both terminal event time
		(e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal event time (e.g., time-
		to-tumour progression). See Emura et al. (2015)
		doi:10.1177/0962280215604510 and Emura et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1177/0962280216688032 for details. Survival data from
		ovarian cancer patients are also available.
