		NASA 'EarthData' Login Utilities // Providing easy, portable
		access to NASA 'EarthData' products through the use of bearer
		tokens. Much of NASA's public data catalogs hosted and
		maintained by its 12 Distributed Active Archive Centers
		('DAACs') are now made available on the Amazon Web Services
		'S3' storage.  However, accessing this data through the
		standard 'S3' API is restricted to only to compute resources
		running inside 'us-west-2' Data Center in Portland, Oregon,
		which allows NASA to avoid being charged data egress rates.
		This package provides public access to the data from any
		networked device by using the 'EarthData' login application
		programming interface (API),
		https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-
		description/eosdis-components/earthdata-login, providing
		convenient authentication and access to cloud-hosted NASA
		'EarthData' products. This makes access to a wide range of
		earth observation data from any location straight forward and
		compatible with R packages that are widely used with cloud
		native earth observation data (such as 'terra', 'sf', etc.)
