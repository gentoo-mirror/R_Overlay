		Robust Land-Use Optimization // Robust multi-criteria land-
		allocation optimization that explicitly accounts for the
		uncertainty of the indicators in the objective function. Solves
		the problem of allocating scarce land to various land-use
		options with regard to multiple, coequal indicators. The method
		aims to find the land allocation that represents the indicator
		composition with the best possible trade-off under uncertainty.
		optimLanduse includes the actual optimization procedure as
		described by Knoke et al. (2016) doi:10.1038/ncomms11877 and
		the post-hoc calculation of the portfolio performance as
		presented by Gosling et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1007/s10457-020-00519-0.
