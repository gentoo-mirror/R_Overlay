		Isotonic Boosting Classification Rules // In classification
		problems a monotone relation between some predictors and the
		classes may be assumed. In this package 'isoboost' we propose
		new boosting algorithms, based on LogitBoost, that incorporate
		this isotonicity information, yielding more accurate and easily
		interpretable rules.
