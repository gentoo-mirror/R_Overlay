		'MicroRNA' Set Enrichment Analysis // The tools for 'MicroRNA Set
		Enrichment Analysis' can identify risk pathways(or prior gene
		sets) regulated by microRNA set in the context of microRNA
		expression data. (1) This package constructs a correlation
		profile of microRNA and pathways by the hypergeometric
		statistic test. The gene sets of pathways derived from the
		three public databases (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
		('KEGG'); 'Reactome'; 'Biocarta') and the target gene sets of
		microRNA are provided by four databases('TarBaseV6.0';
		'mir2Disease'; 'miRecords'; 'miRTarBase';). (2) This package
		can quantify the change of correlation between microRNA for
		each pathway(or prior gene set) based on a microRNA expression
		data with cases and controls. (3) This package uses the
		weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to calculate an
		enrichment score (ES) of a microRNA set that co-regulate to a
		pathway , which reflects the degree to which a given pathway is
		associated with the specific phenotype. (4) This package can
		provide the visualization of the results.
