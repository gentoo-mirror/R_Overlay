		Survival Analysis using Time Dependent Covariate for Animal
		Breeding // Survival analysis is employed to model the time it
		takes for events to occur. Survival model examines the
		relationship between survival and one or more predictors,
		usually termed covariates in the survival-analysis literature.
		To this end, Cox-proportional (Cox-PH) hazard rate model
		introduced in a seminal paper by Cox (1972)
		doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1972.tb00899.x, is a broadly applicable
		and the most widely used method of survival analysis. This
		package can be used to estimate the effect of fixed and time-
		dependent covariates and also to compute the survival
		probabilities of the lactation of dairy animal. This package
		has been developed using algorithm of Klein and  Moeschberger
