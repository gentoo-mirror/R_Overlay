		Partition Exchangeability Toolkit // Bayesian supervised
		predictive classifiers, hypothesis testing, and parametric
		estimation under Partition Exchangeability are implemented. The
		two classifiers presented are the marginal classifier (that
		assumes test data is i.i.d.) next to a more computationally
		costly but accurate simultaneous classifier (that finds a
		labelling for the entire test dataset at once based on
		simultanous use of all the test data to predict each label). We
		also provide the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the
		only underlying parameter of the partition exchangeability
		generative model as well as hypothesis testing statistics for
		equality of this parameter with a single value, alternative, or
		multiple samples. We present functions to simulate the
		sequences from Ewens Sampling Formula as the realisation of the
		Poisson-Dirichlet distribution and their respective
		probabilities.
