		Interactive Studio with Explanations for ML Predictive Models //
		Automate explanation of machine learning predictive models.
		This package generates advanced interactive and animated model
		explanations in the form of serverless HTML site. It combines
		'R' with 'D3.js' to produce plots and descriptions for local
		and global explanations. The whole is greater than the sum of
		its parts, so it also supports EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
		on top of that. 'modelStudio' is a fast and condensed way to
		get all the answers without much effort. Break down your model
		and look into its ingredients with only a few lines of code.
