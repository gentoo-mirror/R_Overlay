		Interactive Studio for Explanatory Model Analysis // Automate the
		explanatory analysis of machine learning predictive models.
		Generate advanced interactive and animated model explanations
		in the form of a serverless HTML site with only one line of
		code. This tool is model agnostic, therefore compatible with
		most of the black box predictive models and frameworks. The
		main function computes various (instance and dataset level)
		model explanations and produces an interactive, customisable
		dashboard. It consists of multiple panels for plots with their
		short descriptions. Easily save and share the dashboard with
		others. Tools for model exploration unite with tools for EDA
		(Exploratory Data Analysis) to give a broad overview of the
		model behavior.
