		Interactive Studio with Explanations for ML Predictive Models //
		Automate explanation of machine learning predictive models.
		This package generates advanced interactive and animated model
		explanations in the form of a serverless HTML site. It combines
		'R' with 'D3.js' to produce plots and descriptions for various
		local and global explanations. Tools for model exploration
		unite with tools for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to give a
		broad overview of the model behaviour. 'modelStudio' is a fast
		and condensed way to get all the answers without much effort.
		Break down your model and look into its ingredients with only a
		few lines of code.
