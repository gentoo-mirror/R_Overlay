		Interactive Studio for Explanatory Model Analysis // Automate the
		explanatory analysis of machine learning predictive models.
		Generate advanced interactive model explanations in the form of
		a serverless HTML site with only one line of code. This tool is
		model-agnostic, therefore compatible with most of the black-box
		predictive models and frameworks. The main function computes
		various (instance and model-level) explanations and produces a
		customisable dashboard, which consists of multiple panels for
		plots with their short descriptions. It is possible to easily
		save the dashboard and share it with others. modelStudio
		facilitates the process of Interactive Explanatory Model
