		Interactive Studio for Explanatory Model Analysis // Automate the
		explanatory analysis of machine learning predictive models.
		Generate advanced interactive model explanations in the form of
		a serverless HTML site with only one line of code. This tool is
		model agnostic, therefore compatible with most of the black box
		predictive models and frameworks. The main function computes
		various (instance and dataset level) model explanations and
		produces a customisable dashboard, which consists of multiple
		panels for plots with their short descriptions. Easily save the
		dashboard and share it with others. Tools for Explanatory Model
		Analysis unite with tools for Exploratory Data Analysis to give
		a broad overview of the model behavior.
