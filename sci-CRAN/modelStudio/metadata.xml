		Interactive Studio for Explanatory Model Analysis // Automate the
		explanatory analysis of machine learning predictive models.
		This package generates advanced interactive and animated model
		explanations in the form of a serverless HTML site with only
		one line of code. The main function computes various (instance
		and dataset level) model explanations and produces an
		interactive, customisable dashboard made with 'D3.js'. It
		consists of multiple panels for plots with their short
		descriptions. Easily save and share the dashboard with others.
		Tools for model exploration unite with tools for EDA
		(Exploratory Data Analysis) to give a broad overview of the
		model behavior.
