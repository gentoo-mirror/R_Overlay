		Likert Category Distance Calculator // It is assumed that
		psychological distances between the categories are equal for
		the measurement instruments consisted of polytomously scored
		items. According to Muraki, this assumption must be tested. In
		the examination process of this assumption, the fit indexes are
		obtained and evaluated. This package provides that this
		assumption is removed. By with this package, the converted
		scale values of all items in a measurement instrument can be
		calculated by estimating a category parameter set for each
		item. Thus, the calculations can be made without any need to
		usage of the common category parameter set. Through this
		package, the psychological distances of the items are scaled.
		The scaling of a category parameter set for each item cause
		differentiation of score of the categories will be got from
		items. Also, the total measurement instrument score of an
		individual can be calculated according to the scaling of item
		score categories by with this package.This package provides
		that the place of individuals related to the structure to be
		measured with a measurement instrument consisted of
		polytomously scored items can be reveal more accurately. In
		this way, it is thought that the results obtained about
		individuals can be made more sensitive, and the differences
		between individuals can be revealed more accurately. On the
		other hand, it can be argued that more accurate evidences can
		be obtained regarding the psychometric properties of the
		measurement instruments.
