		Stochastic Newton Sampler (SNS) // Stochastic Newton Sampler
		(SNS) is a Metropolis-Hastings-based, Markov Chain Monte Carlo
		sampler for twice differentiable, log-concave probability
		density functions (PDFs) where the proposal density function is
		a multivariate Gaussian resulting from a second-order Taylor-
		series expansion of log-density around the current point. The
		mean of the Gaussian proposal is the full Newton-Raphson step
		from the current point. A Boolean flag allows for switching
		from SNS to Newton-Raphson optimization (by choosing the mean
		of proposal function as next point). This can be used during
		burn-in to get close to the mode of the PDF (which is unique
		due to concavity). For high-dimensional densities, mixing can
		be improved via 'state space partitioning' strategy, in which
		SNS is applied to disjoint subsets of state space, wrapped in a
		Gibbs cycle. Numerical differentiation is available when
		analytical expressions for gradient and Hessian are not
		available. Facilities for validation and numerical
		differentiation of log-density are provided. Note: Formerly
		available versions of the MfUSampler can be obtained from the
		archive
		https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/MfUSampler/.
