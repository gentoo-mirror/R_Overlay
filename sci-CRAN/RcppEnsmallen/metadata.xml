		Header-Only C++ Mathematical Optimization Library for 'Armadillo'
		// 'Ensmallen' is a templated C++ mathematical optimization
		library (by the 'MLPACK' team) that provides a simple set of
		abstractions for writing an objective function to optimize.
		Provided within are various standard and cutting-edge
		optimizers that include full-batch gradient descent techniques,
		small-batch techniques, gradient-free optimizers, and
		constrained optimization. The 'RcppEnsmallen' package includes
		the header files from the 'Ensmallen' library and pairs the
		appropriate header files from 'armadillo' through the
		'RcppArmadillo' package. Therefore, users do not need to
		install 'Ensmallen' nor 'Armadillo' to use 'RcppEnsmallen'.
		Note that 'Ensmallen' is licensed under 3-Clause BSD,
		'Armadillo' starting from 7.800.0 is licensed under Apache
		License 2, 'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to
		'Armadillo') is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later.
		Thus, 'RcppEnsmallen' is also licensed under similar terms.
		Note that 'Ensmallen' requires a compiler that supports 'C++11'
		and 'Armadillo' 8.400 or later.
