		Interactively Insert Emojis in 'R' Documents // Provides an
		intuitive and user-friendly interface for working with emojis
		in 'R'. It allows users to search, insert, and manage emojis by
		keyword, category, or through an interactive 'shiny'-based
		drop-down. The package enables integration of emojis into 'R'
		scripts, 'R Markdown', 'Quarto', 'shiny' apps, and 'ggplot2'
		plots. Also includes built-in mappings for commit messages,
		useful for version control. It builds on established emoji
		libraries and Unicode standards, adding expressiveness and
		visual cues to documentation, user interfaces, and reports. For
		more details see 'Emojipedia' (2024) https://emojipedia.org and
		GitHub Emoji Cheat Sheet https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-
		cheat-sheet/tree/master.
