		Non-Parametric Multiple Change-Point Analysis of Multivariate
		Data // Implements various procedures for finding multiple
		change-points. Two methods make use of dynamic programming and
		pruning, with no distributional assumptions other than the
		existence of certain absolute moments in one method.
		Hierarchical and exact search methods are included. All methods
		return the set of estimated change- points as well as other
		summary information.
