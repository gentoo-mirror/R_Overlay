		Tipping Point Analyses // The strength of evidence provided by
		epidemiological and observational studies is inherently limited
		by the potential for unmeasured confounding.  We focus on three
		key quantities: the observed bound of the confidence interval
		closest to the null, the relationship between an unmeasured
		confounder and the outcome, for example a plausible residual
		effect size for an unmeasured continuous or binary confounder,
		and the relationship between an unmeasured confounder and the
		exposure, for example a realistic mean difference or prevalence
		difference for this hypothetical confounder between exposure
		groups. Building on the methods put forth by Cornfield et al.
		(1959), Bross (1966), Schlesselman (1978), Rosenbaum  Rubin
		(1983), Lin et al. (1998), Lash et al. (2009), Rosenbaum
		(1986), Cinelli  Hazlett (2020), VanderWeele  Ding (2017), and
		Ding  VanderWeele (2016), we can use these quantities to assess
		how an unmeasured confounder may tip our result to
		insignificance.
