		Split-Population Duration (Cure) Regression // An implementation
		of split-population duration regression models. Unlike regular
		duration models, split-population duration models are mixture
		models that accommodate the presence of a sub-population that
		is not at risk for failure, e.g. cancer patients who have been
		cured by treatment. This package implements Weibull and
		Loglogistic forms for the duration component, and focuses on
		data with time-varying covariates. These models were originally
		formulated in Boag (1949) http://www.jstor.org/stable/2983694
		and Berkson and Gage (1952)
		http://www.jstor.org/stable/2281318, and extended in Schmidt
		and Witte (1989) doi:10.1016/0304-4076(89)90034-1.
