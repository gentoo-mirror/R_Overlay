		Simple Tools for Examining and Cleaning Dirty Data // The main
		janitor functions can: perfectly format data.frame column
		names; provide quick counts of variable combinations (i.e.,
		frequency tables and crosstabs); and explore duplicate records.
		Other janitor functions nicely format the tabulation results.
		These tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular
		features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel. This package follows the
		principles of the "tidyverse" and works well with the pipe
		function %%. janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R
		users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness.
