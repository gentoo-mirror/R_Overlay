		Group Lasso and Elastic Net Solver for Generalized Linear Models
		// Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire group
		lasso and group elastic net regularization path for GLMs,
		multinomial, the Cox model and multi-task Gaussian models.
		Similar to the R package 'glmnet' in scope of models, and in
		computational speed.  This package provides  R bindings to the
		C++ code underlying the corresponding Python package 'adelie'.
		These bindings offer a general purpose group elastic net
		solver, a wide range of matrix classes that can exploit special
		structure to allow large-scale inputs, and an assortment of
		generalized linear model classes for fitting various types of
		data. The package is an implementation of Yang, J. and Hastie,
		T. (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2405.08631.
