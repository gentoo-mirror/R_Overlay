		Joint Modelling of Functional Traits // Fitting and analyzing a
		Joint Trait Distribution Model. The Joint Trait Distribution
		Model is implemented in the Bayesian framework using conjugate
		priors and posteriors, thus guaranteeing fast inference. In
		particular the package computes joint probabilities and
		multivariate confidence intervals, and enables the
		investigation of how they depend on the environment through
		partial response curves. The method implemented by the package
		is described in Poggiato et al. (2023) doi:10.1111/geb.13706.
