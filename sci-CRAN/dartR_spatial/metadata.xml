		Applying Landscape Genomic Methods on 'SNP' and 'Silicodart' Data
		// Provides landscape genomic functions to analyse 'SNP'
		(single nuclear polymorphism) data, such as least cost path
		analysis and isolation by distance. Therefore each sample needs
		to have coordinate data attached (lat/lon) to be able to run
		most of the functions. 'dartR.spatial' is a package that
		belongs to the 'dartRverse' suit of packages and depends on
		'dartR.base' and 'dartR.data'.
