		Tool for Annotating Images in Preparation for Analysis // A tool
		to help create shiny apps for selecting and annotating elements
		of images. Users must supply images, questions, and answer
		choices. The user interface is a dynamic shiny app, that
		displays the images and questions and answer choices. The data
		generated can be saved to a file that can be used for
		subsequent analysis. The original purpose was to annotate still
		images from tennis video for face recognition and emotion
		detection purposes.
