		Species Sensitivity Distributions // Species sensitivity
		distributions are cumulative probability distributions which
		are fitted to toxicity concentrations for multiple species. The
		ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit log-normal,
		log-logistic, log-Gumbel, Gompertz, gamma or Weibull
		distributions. Multiple distributions can be averaged using
		Information Criteria. Confidence intervals can be calculated
		for the fitted cumulative distribution function or specific
		hazard concentrations (percentiles). Confidence intervals are
		currently produced by bootstrapping.
