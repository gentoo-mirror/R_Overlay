		Species Sensitivity Distributions // Species sensitivity
		distributions are cumulative probability distributions which
		are fitted to toxicity concentrations for different species as
		described by Posthuma et al.(2001) isbn:9781566705783. The
		ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions
		such as the log-normal, gamma, burr Type-III, log-logistic,
		log-Gumbel, Gompertz and Weibull. The user can provide custom
		distributions. Multiple distributions can be averaged using
		Information Criteria. Confidence intervals on hazard
		concentrations and proportions are produced by parametric
		bootstrapping.
