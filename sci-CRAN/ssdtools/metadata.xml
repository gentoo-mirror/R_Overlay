		Species Sensitivity Distributions // Species sensitivity
		distributions are cumulative probability distributions which
		are fitted to toxicity concentrations for different species as
		described by Posthuma et al.(2001) isbn:9781566705783. The
		ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions
		such as the gamma, log-logistic, log-normal and log-normal log-
		normal mixture. Multiple distributions can be averaged using
		Akaike Information Criteria.  Confidence intervals on hazard
		concentrations and proportions are produced by bootstrapping.
