		Sequentially-Allocated Latent Structure Optimization // Point
		estimation for partition distributions using the sequentially-
		allocated latent structure optimization (SALSO) method to
		minimize the expectation of the Binder loss or the lower bound
		of the expectation of the variation of information loss. The
		SALSO method was presented at the workshop "Bayesian
		Nonparametric Inference: Dependence Structures and their
		Applications" in Oaxaca, Mexico on December 6, 2017. See
