		Search Algorithms and Loss Functions for Bayesian Clustering //
		The SALSO algorithm is an efficient greedy search procedure to
		obtain a clustering estimate based on a partition loss
		function. The algorithm is implemented for many loss functions,
		including the Binder loss and a generalization of the variation
		of information loss, both of which allow for unequal weights on
		the two types of clustering mistakes. Efficient implementations
		are also provided for Monte Carlo estimation of the posterior
		expected loss of a given clustering estimate. SALSO was first
		presented at the workshop "Bayesian Nonparametric Inference:
		Dependence Structures and their Applications" in Oaxaca, Mexico
		on December 6, 2017. See https://www.birs.ca/events/2017/5-day-
		workshops/17w5060/schedule.
