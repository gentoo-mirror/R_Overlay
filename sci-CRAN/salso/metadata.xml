		Search Algorithms and Loss Functions for Bayesian Clustering //
		The SALSO algorithm is an efficient randomized greedy search
		method to find a point estimate for a random partition based on
		a loss function and posterior Monte Carlo samples. The
		algorithm is implemented for many loss functions, including the
		Binder loss and a generalization of the variation of
		information loss, both of which allow for unequal weights on
		the two types of clustering mistakes. Efficient implementations
		are also provided for Monte Carlo estimation of the posterior
		expected loss of a given clustering estimate. See Dahl,
		Johnson, Mller (2021) arXiv:2105.04451.
