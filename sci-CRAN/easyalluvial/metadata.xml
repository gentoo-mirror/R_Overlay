		Generate Alluvial Plots with a Single Line of Code // Alluvial
		plots are similar to sankey diagrams and visualise categorical
		data over multiple dimensions as flows. (Rosvall M, Bergstrom
		CT (2010) Mapping Change in Large Networks. PLoS ONE 5(1):
		e8694. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008694 Their graphical grammar
		however is a bit more complex then that of a regular x/y plots.
		The 'ggalluvial' package made a great job of translating that
		grammar into 'ggplot2' syntax and gives you many options to
		tweak the appearance of an alluvial plot, however there still
		remains a multi-layered complexity that makes it difficult to
		use 'ggalluvial' for explorative data analysis. 'easyalluvial'
		provides a simple interface to this package that allows you to
		produce a decent alluvial plot from any dataframe in either
		long or wide format from a single line of code while also
		handling continuous data. It is meant to allow a quick
		visualisation of entire dataframes with a focus on different
		colouring options that can make alluvial plots a great tool for
		data exploration.
