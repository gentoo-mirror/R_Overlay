		plotting custom sequence logos // RWebLogo is a wrapper for the
		WebLogo python package that allows generating of customised
		sequence logos. Sequence logos are graphical representations of
		the sequence conservation of nucleotides (in a strand of
		DNA/RNA) or amino acids (in protein sequences). Each logo
		consists of stacks of symbols, one stack for each position in
		the sequence. The overall height of the stack indicates the
		sequence conservation at that position, while the height of
		symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of
		each amino or nucleic acid at that position. In general, a
		sequence logo provides a richer and more precise description
		of, for example, a binding site, than would a consensus
		sequence.
