		Rounding to Decimal Digits // Decimal rounding is non-trivial in
		binary arithmetic.  ISO standard round to even is more rare
		than typically assumed as most decimal fractions are not
		exactly representable in binary.  Our roundX() versions explore
		differences between current and potential future versions of
		round() in R. Further, provides (some partly related) C99 math
		lib functions not in base R.
