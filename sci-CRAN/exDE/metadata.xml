		Extensible Differential Equations for Mosquito-Borne Pathogen
		Modeling // Provides tools to set up modular ordinary and delay
		differential equation models for mosquito-borne pathogens,
		focusing on malaria. Modular design is achieved by S3 dispatch
		on parameter lists for each component which is used to compute
		the full set of differential equations which may be solved
		using any of the packages for numerical simulation of
		differential equations in R. The methods implemented by this
		package are described in Wu et al. (2022)
