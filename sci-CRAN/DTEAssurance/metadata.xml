		Assurance Methods for Clinical Trials with a Delayed Treatment
		Effect // Provides functions for planning clinical trials
		subject to a delayed treatment effect using assurance-based
		methods. Includes two 'shiny' applications for interactive
		exploration, simulation, and visualisation of trial designs and
		outcomes. The methodology is described in: Salsbury JA, Oakley
		JE, Julious SA, Hampson LV (2024) "Assurance methods for
		designing a clinical trial with a delayed treatment effect"
