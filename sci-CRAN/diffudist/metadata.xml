		Diffusion Distance for Complex Networks // Enables the evaluation
		of diffusion distances for complex single-layer networks. Given
		a network one can define different types of Laplacian (or
		transition) matrices corresponding to different continuous-time
		random walks dynamics on the network. This package enables the
		evaluation of Laplacians, stochastic matrices, and the
		corresponding diffusion distance matrices. The metric structure
		induced by the network-driven process is richer and more robust
		than the one given by shortest-paths and allows to study the
		geometry induced by different types of diffusion-like
		communication mechanisms taking place on complex networks. For
		more details see: De Domenico, M. (2017)
		doi:10.1103/physrevlett.118.168301 and Bertagnolli, G. and De
		Domenico, M. (2021) doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.103.042301.
