		Removal of Unwanted Technical Variation from UK Biobank NMR
		Metabolomics Biomarker Data // A suite of utilities for working
		with the UK Biobank https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ Nuclear
		Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomics data
		https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=220.
		Includes functions for extracting biomarkers from decoded UK
		Biobank field data, removing unwanted technical variation from
		biomarker concentrations, computing an extended set of lipid,
		fatty acid, and cholesterol fractions, and for re-deriving
		composite biomarkers and ratios after adjusting data for
		unwanted biological variation. For further details on methods
		see Ritchie SC et al. medRxiv (2021)
