		Estimation of Hawkes Processes from Binned Observations //
		Implements an estimation method for Hawkes processes when count
		data are only observed in discrete time, using a spectral
		approach derived from the Bartlett spectrum, see Cheysson and
		Lang (2020) arXiv:2003.04314. Some general use functions for
		Hawkes processes are also included: simulation of
		(in)homogeneous Hawkes process, maximum likelihood estimation,
		residual analysis, etc.
