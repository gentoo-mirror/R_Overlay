		Elimination of Noisy Samples in Regression Datasets using Noise
		Filters // Traditional noise filtering methods aim at removing
		noisy samples from a classification dataset. This package
		adapts classic and recent filtering techniques for use in
		regression problems, and it also incorporates methods
		specifically designed for regression data. In order to do this,
		it uses approaches proposed in the specialized literature, such
		as Martin et al. (2021) [doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123151] and
		Arnaiz-Gonzalez et al. (2016) [doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2015.12.046].
		Thus, the goal of the implemented noise filters is to eliminate
		samples with noise in regression datasets.
