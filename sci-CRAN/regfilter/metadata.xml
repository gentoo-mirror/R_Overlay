		Elimination of Noisy Samples in Regression Datasets using Noise
		Filters // Traditional noise filtering methods aim at removing
		noisy samples from a classification dataset. This package
		adapts classic and recent filtering techniques to be used in
		regression problems. To do this, it uses the approach proposed
		in Martin (2021) [doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123151]. Thus, the
		goal of the implemented noise filters is to eliminate samples
		with noise in regression datasets.
