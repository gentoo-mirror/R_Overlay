		Environments Behaving (Almost) as Lists // List environments are
		environments that have list-like properties.  For instance, the
		elements of a list environment are ordered and can be accessed
		and iterated over using index subsetting, e.g. 'x - listenv(a =
		1, b = 2); for (i in seq_along(x)) x[[i]] - x[[i]] ^ 2; y -
		as.list(x)'.
