		105 Data Sets from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach"
		by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge // Those new to econometrics and R may
		find themselves challenged by data management tasks inherent to
		both. The wooldridge data package aims to lighten the task by
		efficiently loading any data set from the text with a single
		command. Collectively, all data sets have been compressed to
		62.73% of their original size. Most sets have robust
		documentation including page numbers on which they are used,
		original data sources, original year of publication, and notes
		which chronicle their history while offering ideas for further
		exploration and research. To resurrect a data set, one can pass
		it's name to the `data()` function or just define it as the
		`data =` argument of the model function. The data will lazily
		load and, provided the syntax is correct, model estimates shall
		spring forth from the otherwise lifeless abyss of your R
		console! If the syntax is an issue, the wooldridge-vignette
		displays solutions to examples from each chapter of the text,
		providing a relevant introduction to econometric modeling with
		R. The vignette closes with an Appendix of recommended sources
		for R and econometrics. Note: Data sets are from the 5th
		edition (Wooldridge 2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), and are
		compatible with all others.
