		111 Data Sets from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach,
		6e" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge // Students learning both
		econometrics and R may find the introduction to both
		challenging. However, if the text is "Introductory
		Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, they
		are in luck! The wooldridge data package aims to lighten the
		task by efficiently loading any data set found in the text with
		a single command. Data sets have all been compressed to a
		fraction of their original size and are well documented.
		Documentation files contain the page numbers of the text where
		each set is used, the original source, time of publication, and
		notes suggesting ideas for further exploratory data analysis
		and research. If one need's to brush-up on model syntax, a
		vignette contains R solutions to examples from each chapter of
		the text. Data sets are from the 6th edition (Wooldridge 2016,
		ISBN-13: 978-1-305-27010-7), and are backwards compatible with
		all versions of the text.
