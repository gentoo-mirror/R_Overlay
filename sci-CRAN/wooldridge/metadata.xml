		105 Data Sets from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach"
		by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge // Economics students new to both
		econometrics and R may find the simultaneous introduction to
		both challenging. In particular, the process of loading and
		preparing data before building one's first model can present
		challenges. The `wooldridge` data package aims to lighten the
		task by loading any data set from the text into the current
		working environment with a single command. The package contains
		documentation for each set and all data has been compressed to
		62.73% of its original size. Just install the package, load it,
		and use the `data()` function to call the data set you need to
		work with. In addition, a wooldridge-vignette illustrates
		solutions to examples from each chapter of the text, offering a
		relevant introduction to econometric modelling with R. The
		vignette also includes an Appendix to helpful resources about
		using R for econometrics. Note: Data sets are from the 5th
		edition (Wooldridge 2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), and are
		compatible with others.
