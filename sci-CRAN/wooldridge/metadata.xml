		105 Data Sets from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach"
		by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge // Economics students new to both
		Econometrics and R may find the tasks of learning both a bit
		daunting. However, if your text is "Introductory Econometrics:
		A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, then you are in
		luck! The `wooldridge` data package aims to lighten the task by
		loading any data set from the text with a single command. In
		addition, the package contains documentation for each data set
		and all data has been efficiently compressed resulting in a
		total size that is 62.73% of its original. A wooldridge-
		vignette recreates examples from every chapter of the text,
		offering a relevant introduction to R's statistical model
		syntax. Note: Data sets are from the 5th edition (Wooldridge
		2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), which is compatible with all
		other editions.
