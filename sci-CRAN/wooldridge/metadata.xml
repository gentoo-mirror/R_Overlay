		115 Data Sets from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach,
		7e" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge // Students learning both
		econometrics and R may find the introduction to both
		challenging. The wooldridge data package aims to lighten the
		task by efficiently loading any data set found in the text with
		a single command. Data sets have been compressed to a fraction
		of their original size. Documentation files contain page
		numbers, the original source, time of publication, and notes
		from the author suggesting avenues for further analysis and
		research. If one needs an introduction to linear model syntax,
		a vignette contains R solutions to examples from each chapter
		of the text. Data sets are from the 7th edition (Wooldridge
		2020, ISBN-13: 978-1-337-55886-0), and are backwards compatible
		with all versions of the text.
