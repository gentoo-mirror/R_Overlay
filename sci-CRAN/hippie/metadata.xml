		Hippie Code Completion in 'RStudio' // An 'RStudio' Addin for
		Hippie Expand (AKA Hippie Code Completion or Cyclic Expand
		Word). This type of completion searches for matching tokens
		within the user's current source editor file, regardless of
		file type. By searching only within the current source file,
		'hippie' offers a fast way to identify and insert completions
		that appear around the user's cursor.
