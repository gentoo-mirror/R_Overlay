		Create Data Frames that are Easier to Exchange and Reuse // The
		aim of the 'dataset' package is to make tidy datasets easier to
		release, exchange and reuse. It organizes and formats data
		frame 'R' objects into well-referenced, well-described,
		interoperable datasets into release and reuse ready form. A
		subjective interpretation of the  W3C  DataSet recommendation
		and the datacube model  https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/,
		which is also used in the global Statistical Data and Metadata
		eXchange standards, the application of the connected Dublin
		Core https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-
		core/dcmi-terms/ and DataCite
		https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-44/
		standards preferred by European open science repositories to
		improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability and
		reusability of the datasets.
