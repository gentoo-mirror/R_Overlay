		Statistical Analysis for Random Objects and Non-Euclidean Data //
		Provides implementation of statistical methods for random
		objects lying in various metric spaces, which are not
		necessarily linear spaces. The core of this package is Frchet
		regression for random objects with Euclidean predictors, which
		allows one to perform regression analysis for non-Euclidean
		responses under some mild conditions. Examples include
		distributions in 2-Wasserstein space, covariance matrices
		endowed with power metric (with Frobenius metric as a special
		case), Cholesky and log-Cholesky metrics, spherical data.
