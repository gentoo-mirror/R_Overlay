		Functional Principal Components Logistic Regression // Functions
		for fitting a functional principal components logit regression
		model in four different situations: ordinary and filtered
		functional principal components of functional predictors,
		included in the model according to their variability
		explanation power, and according to their prediction ability by
		stepwise methods. The proposed methods were developed in
