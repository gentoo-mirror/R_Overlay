		Evaluation Metrics for Customer Scoring Models Depending on
		Binary Classifiers // Functions for evaluating and visualizing
		predictive model performance (specifically: binary classifiers)
		in the field of customer scoring. These metrics include lift,
		lift index, gain percentage, top-decile lift, F1-score,
		expected misclassification cost and absolute misclassification
		cost. See Berry  Linoff (2004, ISBN:0-471-47064-3), Witten and
		Frank (2005, 0-12-088407-0) and Blattberg, Kim  Neslin (2008,
		ISBN:9780387725789) for details. Visualization functions are
		included for lift charts and gain percentage charts. All
		metrics that require class predictions offer the possibility to
		dynamically determine cutoff values for transforming real-
		valued probability predictions into class predictions.
