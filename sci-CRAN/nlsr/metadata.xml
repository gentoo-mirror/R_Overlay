		Functions for Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions - Updated 2022 //
		Provides tools for working with nonlinear least squares
		problems. For the estimation of models reliable and robust
		tools than nls(), where the the Gauss-Newton method frequently
		stops with 'singular gradient' messages. This is accomplished
		by using, where possible, analytic derivatives to compute the
		matrix of derivatives and a stabilization of the solution of
		the estimation equations. Tools for approximate or externally
		supplied derivative matrices are included. Bounds and masks on
		parameters are handled properly.
