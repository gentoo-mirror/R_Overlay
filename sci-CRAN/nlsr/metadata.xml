		Functions for Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions // Provides tools
		for working with nonlinear least squares problems. It is
		intended to eventually supersede the nls() function in the R
		distribution. For example, nls() specifically does NOT deal
		with small or zero residual problems as its Gauss-Newton method
		frequently stops with 'singular gradient' messages. nlsr is
		based on the now-deprecated package nlmrt, and has refactored
		functions and R-language symbolic derivative features.
