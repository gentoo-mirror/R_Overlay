		Surrogate Residuals for Ordinal and General Regression Models //
		An implementation of the surrogate approach to residuals and
		diagnostics for ordinal and general regression models; for
		details, see Liu and Zhang (2017)
		doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915. These residuals can be used
		to construct standard residual plots for model diagnostics
		(e.g., residual-vs-fitted value plots, residual-vs-covariate
		plots, Q-Q plots, etc.). The package also provides an
		'autoplot' function for producing standard diagnostic plots
		using 'ggplot2' graphics. The package currently supports
		cumulative link models from packages 'MASS', 'ordinal', 'rms',
		and 'VGAM'. Support for binary regression models using the
		standard 'glm' function is also available.
