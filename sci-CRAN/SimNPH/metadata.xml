		Simulate Non-Proportional Hazards // A toolkit for simulation
		studies concerning time-to-event endpoints with non-
		proportional hazards. 'SimNPH' encompasses functions for
		simulating time-to-event data in various scenarios, simulating
		different trial designs like fixed-followup, event-driven, and
		group sequential designs. The package provides functions to
		calculate the true values of common summary statistics for the
		implemented scenarios and offers common analysis methods for
		time-to-event data. Helper functions for running simulations
		with the 'SimDesign' package and for aggregating and presenting
		the results are also included. Results of the conducted
		simulation study are available as preprint: "A neutral
		comparison of statistical methods for time-to-event analyses
		under non-proportional hazards", Klinglmueller et al. (2023)
		doi:10.48550/ARXIV.2310.05622.
