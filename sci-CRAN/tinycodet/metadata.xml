		A Few Functions to Help in your Coding Etiquette // Adds a few
		functions to help in your coding etiquette. 'tinycodet'
		primarily focuses on 4 aspects. 1) Safer decimal (in)equality
		testing, safer atomic conversions, and other functions for
		safer coding. 2) A new package import system, that attempts to
		combine the benefits of using a package without attaching, with
		the benefits of attaching a package. 3) Extending the string
		manipulation capabilities of the 'stringi' R package. 4)
		Reducing repetitive code. 'tinycodet' has only one dependency,
		namely 'stringi'.
