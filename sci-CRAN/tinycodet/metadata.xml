		Functions to Help in your Coding Etiquette // Adds some functions
		to help in your coding etiquette. 'tinycodet' primarily focuses
		on 4 aspects. 1) Safer decimal (in)equality testing, standard-
		evaluated alternatives to with() and aes(), and other functions
		for safer coding. 2) A new package import system, that attempts
		to combine the benefits of using a package without attaching
		it, with the benefits of attaching a package. 3) Extending the
		string manipulation capabilities of the 'stringi' R package. 4)
		Reducing repetitive code. Besides linking to 'Rcpp',
		'tinycodet' has only one other dependency, namely 'stringi'.
