		Creation of Lightweight Docker Images for Your Packages // Build
		a lightweight Docker r-base container image for your R package,
		in which the package itself is available. The Docker image
		seeks to mirror your R session as close as possible with
		respect to R specific dependencies. Both dependencies on CRAN R
		packages as well as local non-CRAN R packages will be included
		in the Docker container image.
