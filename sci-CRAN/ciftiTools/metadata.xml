		Tools for Reading, Writing, Viewing and Manipulating CIFTI Files
		// CIFTI files contain brain imaging data in "grayordinates,"
		which represent the gray matter as cortical surface vertices
		(left and right) and subcortical voxels (cerebellum, basal
		ganglia, and other deep gray matter). 'ciftiTools' provides a
		unified environment for reading, writing, visualizing and
		manipulating CIFTI-format data. It supports the "dscalar,"
		"dlabel," and "dtseries" intents. Grayordinate data is read in
		as a "xifti" object, which is structured for convenient access
		to the data and metadata, and includes support for surface
		geometry files to enable spatially-dependent functionality such
		as static or interactive visualizations and smoothing.
