		Tools for Reading and Visualizing CIFTI Brain Files // CIFTI
		files contain brain imaging data in "gray-ordinates", which
		represent the gray matter as cortical surface vertices (left
		and right) and subcortical voxels (cerebellum, basal ganglia,
		and other deep gray matter). 'ciftiTools' uses the Connectome
		Workbench to read CIFTI files into R and apply common pre-
		processing steps (e.g. smoothing, resampling). It also provides
		tools for visualizing the cortical surface with GIFTI files,
		and for visualizing the subcortical volume.
