		Velocity and Accuracy of the LOg-RAnk TEst // The algorithm
		implemented in this package was designed to quickly estimates
		the distribution of the log-rank especially for heavy
		unbalanced groups. VALORATE estimates the null distribution and
		the p-value of the log-rank test based on a recent formulation.
		For a given number of alterations that define the size of
		survival groups, the estimation involves a weighted sum of
		distributions that are conditional on a co-occurrence term
		where mutations and events are both present. The estimation of
		conditional distributions is quite fast allowing the analysis
		of large datasets in few minutes
