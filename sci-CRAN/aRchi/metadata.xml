		Quantitative Structural Model ('QSM') Treatment for Tree
		Architecture // Provides a set of tools to make quantitative
		structural model of trees (i.e the so-called 'QSM') from LiDAR
		point cloud, to manipulate and visualize the QSMs as well as to
		compute metrics from them. It can be used in various context of
		forest ecology (i.e biomass estimation) and tree architecture
		(i.e architectural metrics), see Martin-Ducup et al. (2020)
		doi:10.1111/1365-2435.13678. The package is based on a new S4
		class called 'aRchi'.
