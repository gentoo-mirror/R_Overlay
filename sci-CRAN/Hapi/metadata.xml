		Inference of Chromosome-Length Haplotypes Using Genomic Data of
		Single Gamete Cells // Inference of chromosome-length
		haplotypes using a few haploid gametes of an individual. The
		gamete genotype data may be generated from various platforms
		including genotyping arrays and sequencing even with low-
		coverage. Hapi simply takes genotype data of known hetSNPs in
		single gamete cells as input and report the high-resolution
		haplotypes as well as confidence of each phased hetSNPs. The
		package also includes a module allowing downstream analyses and
		visualization of identified crossovers in the gametes.
