		Hierarchical Ensemble Methods for Directed Acyclic Graphs // An
		implementation of several Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs)
		for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). 'HEMDAG' package: 1)
		reconciles flat predictions with the topology of the ontology;
		2) can enhance predictions of virtually any flat learning
		methods by taking into account the hierarchical relationships
		between ontology classes; 3) always provides biologically
		consistent predictions according to the hierarchical nature of
		the ontology classes; 4) is specifically designed for
		exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured
		taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the
		Gene Ontology (GO), but can be safely applied to tree-
		structured taxonomies as well (e.g. FunCat), since trees are
		DAGs; 5) scales nicely both in terms of the complexity of the
		taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples; 6) provides
		several utility functions to process and analyze graphs; 7)
		provides several performance metrics to evaluate HEMs
		algorithms. (Marco Notaro, Max Schubach, Peter N. Robinson and
		Giorgio Valentini (2017) doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1854-y).
