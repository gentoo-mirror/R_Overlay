		Hierarchical Ensemble Methods for Directed Acyclic Graphs // An
		implementation of Hierarchical Ensemble Methods for DAGs: 'HTD-
		DAG' (Hierarchical Top Down) and 'TPR-DAG' (True Path Rule).
		'HEMDAG' can be used to enhance the predictions of virtually
		any flat learning method, by taking into account the
		hierarchical nature of the classes of a bio-ontology. 'HEMDAG'
		is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical
		relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, such as the Human
		Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO), but it can
		be also safely applied to tree-structured taxonomies (as
		FunCat), since trees are DAGs. 'HEMDAG' scale nicely both in
		terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality
		of the examples. (Marco Notaro, Max Schubach, Peter N. Robinson
		and Giorgio Valentini, Prediction of Human Phenotype Ontology
		terms by means of Hierarchical Ensemble methods, BMC
		Bioinformatics 2017).
