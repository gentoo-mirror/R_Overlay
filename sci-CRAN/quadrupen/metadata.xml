		Sparsity by Worst-Case Quadratic Penalties // Fits classical
		sparse regression models with efficient active set algorithms
		by solving quadratic problems as described by Grandvalet,
		Chiquet and Ambroise (2017) arXiv:1210.2077. Also provides a
		few methods for model selection purpose (cross-validation,
		stability selection).
