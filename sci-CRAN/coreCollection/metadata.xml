		Core Collection // Create a custom sized Core Collection based on
		a distance matrix and applying the A-NE (accession nearest
		entry), E-NE (entry nearest entry) or E-E (entry entry) method
		as introduced in Jansen and van Hintum (2007)
		doi:10.1007/s00122-006-0433-9 and further elaborated on in
		Odong, T.L. (2012) https://edepot.wur.nl/212422. Optionally a
		list of preselected accessions to be included into the core can
		be set. For each accession in the computed core, if available
		nearby accessions are retrievable that can be used as an
		alternative.
