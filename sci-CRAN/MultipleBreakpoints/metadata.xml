		Estimating Multiple Breakpoints for a Sequence of Realizations of
		Bernoulli Variables // The iterative procedure estimates
		structural changes in the success probability of Bernoulli
		variables. It estimates the number and location of the
		breakpoints as well as the success probability of the different
		sequences between the breakpoints. In addition, it provides a
		graphical illustration of the result.
