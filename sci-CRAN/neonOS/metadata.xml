		observational data are provided via the NEON Data Portal
		https://www.neonscience.org and NEON API, and can be downloaded
		and reformatted by the 'neonUtilities' package. NEON
		observational data (human-observed measurements, and analyses
		derived from human-collected samples, such as tree diameters
		and algal chemistry) are published in a format consisting of
		one or more tabular data files. This package provides tools for
		performing common operations on NEON observational data,
		including checking for duplicates and joining tables.
