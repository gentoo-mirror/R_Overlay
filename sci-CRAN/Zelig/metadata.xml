		Everyone's Statistical Software // A framework that brings
		together an abundance of common statistical models found across
		packages into a unified interface, and provides a common
		architecture for estimation and interpretation, as well as
		bridging functions to absorb increasingly more models into the
		collective library.  Zelig allows each individual package, for
		each statistical model, to be accessed by a common uniformly
		structured call and set of arguments.  Moreover, Zelig
		automates all the surrounding building blocks of a statistical
		workflow --procedures and algorithms that may be essential to
		one user's application but which the original package developer
		did not use in their own research and might not themselves
		support. These include bootstrapping, jackknifing, and
		reweighting of data. In particular, Zelig automatically
		generates predicted and simulated quantities of interest (such
		as relative risk ratios, average treatment effects, first
		differences and predicted and expected values) to interpret and
		visualize complex models.
