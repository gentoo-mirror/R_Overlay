		Everyone's Statistical Software // A framework that brings
		together an abundance of common statistical models found across
		packages into a unified interface, and provides a common
		architecture for estimation and interpretation, as well as
		bridging functions to absorb increasingly more models into the
		package. Zelig allows each individual package, for each
		statistical model, to be accessed by a common uniformly
		structured call and set of arguments. Moreover, Zelig automates
		all the surrounding building blocks of a statistical work-flow
		--procedures and algorithms that may be essential to one user's
		application but which the original package developer did not
		use in their own research and might not themselves support.
		These include bootstrapping, jackknifing, and re-weighting of
		data. In particular, Zelig automatically generates predicted
		and simulated quantities of interest (such as relative risk
		ratios, average treatment effects, first differences and
		predicted and expected values) to interpret and visualize
		complex models.
