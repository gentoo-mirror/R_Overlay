		Approximate Maximisation of Nestedness in Bipartite Graphs //
		Functions to generate graphs that maximise the NODF (nestedness
		metric based on overlap and decreasing fill) metric for a given
		number of rows, columns and links. NODF was originally defined
		by Almeida-Neto et al. (2008)
		doi:10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16644.x. As nestedness in
		ecological networks depends on the size of the networks we
		require normalisation to make them comparable. We offer three
		highly optimised algorithms to find the optimising graphs so
		that users can choose an appropriate trade off between
		computation time and NODF value for the task at hand.
