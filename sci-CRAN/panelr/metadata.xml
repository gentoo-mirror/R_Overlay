		Regression Models and Utilities for Repeated Measures and Panel
		Data // Provides an object type and associated tools for
		storing and wrangling panel data. Implements several methods
		for creating regression models that take advantage of the
		unique aspects of panel data. Among other capabilities,
		automates the "within-between" (also known as "between-within"
		and "hybrid") panel regression specification that combines the
		desirable aspects of both fixed effects and random effects
		econometric models and fits them as multilevel models (Allison,
		2009 doi:10.4135/9781412993869.d33; Bell  Jones, 2015
		doi:10.1017/psrm.2014.7). These models can also be estimated
		via generalized estimating equations (GEE; McNeish, 2019
		doi:10.1080/00273171.2019.1602504) and Bayesian estimation is
		(optionally) supported via 'Stan'. Supports estimation of
		asymmetric effects models via first differences (Allison, 2019
		doi:10.1177/2378023119826441) as well as a generalized linear
		model extension thereof using GEE.
