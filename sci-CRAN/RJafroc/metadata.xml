		Modeling, Analysis, Validation and Visualization of Observer
		Performance Studies in Diagnostic Radiology // Tools for
		quantitative assessment of medical imaging systems,
		radiologists or computer aided ('CAD') algorithms. Implements
		methods described in a book: 'Chakraborty' 'DP' (2017),
		"Observer Performance Methods for Diagnostic Imaging -
		Foundations, Modeling, and Applications with R-Based Examples",
		Taylor-Francis https://www.crcpress.com/9781482214840 and its
		Online Appendices
		https://github.com/dpc10ster/onlinebookk21778. Data collection
		paradigms include receiver operating characteristic ('ROC') and
		a location specific extension, namely free-response 'ROC'
		('FROC'). 'ROC' data consists of a single rating per image,
		where the rating is the perceived confidence level the image is
		of a diseased patient. 'FROC' data consists of a variable
		number (including zero) of mark-rating pairs per image, where a
		mark is the location of a clinically reportable suspicious
		region and the rating is the corresponding confidence level
		that it is a true lesion. The software supersedes the current
		Windows version of 'JAFROC' software
		http://www.devchakraborty.com which is no longer supported.
		'RJafroc' is derived from it being an enhanced R version of
		original Windows 'JAFROC'. Implemented are a number of figures
		of merit quantifying performance, functions for visualizing
		operating characteristics; three ROC ratings data curve-fitting
		algorithms: the 'binormal' model ('BM'), the contaminated
		binormal model ('CBM') and the radiological search model
		('RSM'). Also implemented is maximum likelihood fitting of
		paired ROC data utilizing the correlated 'CBM' model
		('CORCBM'). Unlike the 'BM', 'CBM', 'CORCBM' and the 'RSM'
		predict proper ROC curves that do not cross the chance diagonal
		or display inappropriate hooks, usually near the upper right
		corner of the plots. 'RSM' fitting yields measures of search
		and lesion-classification performances, in addition to the
		usual case-classification performance measured by the area
		under the 'ROC' curve. Search performance is the ability to
		find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions. Lesion-
		classification performance is the ability to discriminate
		between found lesions and non-lesions. For fully crossed study
		designs, termed multiple-reader multiple-case, significance
		testing of reader-averaged figure-of-merit differences between
		modalities is implemented via both 'Dorfman', 'Berbaum' and
		'Metz' ('DBM') and the 'Obuchowski' and 'Rockette' ('OR')
		methods, both substantially improved by 'Hillis'. Single
		treatment analysis allows comparison of performance of a group
		of radiologists to a specified value, or comparison of 'CAD'
		performance to a group of radiologists interpreting the same
		cases. Sample size estimation tools are provided for 'ROC'
		studies that allow estimation of relevant variances from a
		pilot study to predict required numbers of readers and cases in
		a pivotal study. 'FROC' sample size estimation is implemented
		in Online Appendix Chapter 19 available at
		https://github.com/dpc10ster/onlinebookk21778. Utility and data
		file manipulation functions allow data to be read in any of the
		currently used input formats, including Excel, and the results
		of the analysis can be viewed in text or Excel output files.
