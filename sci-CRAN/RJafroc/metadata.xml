		Modeling, Analysis, Validation and Visualization of Observer
		Performance Studies in Diagnostic Radiology // Tools for
		quantitative assessment of medical imaging systems,
		radiologists or computer aided ('CAD') algorithms. Implements
		methods described in a book: 'Chakraborty' 'DP' (2017),
		"Observer Performance Methods for Diagnostic Imaging -
		Foundations, Modeling, and Applications with R-Based Examples",
		Taylor-Francis https://www.crcpress.com/9781482214840. Data
		collection paradigms include receiver operating characteristic
		('ROC') and its location specific extensions, primarily free-
		response 'ROC' ('FROC'). 'ROC' data consists of a single rating
		per image, where the rating is the perceived confidence level
		the image is of a diseased patient. 'FROC' data consists of a
		variable number (including zero) of mark-rating pairs per
		image, where a mark is the location of a clinically reportable
		suspicious region and the rating is the corresponding
		confidence level that it is a true lesion. The software
		supersedes the current Windows version of 'JAFROC' software
		http://www.devchakraborty.com. 'RJafroc' is derived from it
		being an enhanced R version of original Windows 'JAFROC'.
		Implemented are a number of figures of merit quantifying
		performance, functions for visualizing operating
		characteristics; three ROC ratings data curve-fitting
		algorithms: the 'binormal' model ('BM'), the contaminated
		binormal model ('CBM') and the radiological search model
		('RSM'). Unlike the 'BM', the 'CBM' and the 'RSM' predict
		proper ROC curves that do not cross the chance diagonal or
		display inappropriate hooks near the upper right corner of the
		plots. 'RSM' fitting additionally yields measures of search and
		lesion-classification performances, in addition to the usual
		case-classification performance measured by the area under the
		'ROC' curve. Search performance is the ability to find lesions
		while avoiding finding non-lesions. Lesion-classification
		performance is the ability to discriminate between found
		lesions and non-lesions. For fully crossed study designs,
		termed multiple-reader multiple-case, significance testing of
		reader-averaged figure-of-merit differences between modalities
		is implemented via both 'Dorfman', 'Berbaum' and 'Metz' ('DBM')
		and the 'Obuchowski' and 'Rockette' ('OR') methods. Single
		treatment analysis allows comparison of performance of a group
		of radiologists to a specified value, or comparison of 'CAD'
		performance to a group of radiologists interpreting the same
		cases. Sample size estimation tools are provided for 'ROC' and
		'FROC' studies that allow estimation of relevant variances from
		a pilot study to predict required numbers of readers and cases
		in a pivotal study. Utility and data file manipulation
		functions allow data to be read in any of the currently used
		input formats, including Excel, and the results of the analysis
		can be viewed in text or Excel output files. The package is
		used extensively in the online appendices of the cited book.
