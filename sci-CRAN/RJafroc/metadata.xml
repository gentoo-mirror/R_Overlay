		Analyzing Diagnostic Observer Performance Studies // Tools for
		quantitative assessment of medical imaging systems,
		radiologists or computer aided detection ('CAD') algorithms.
		Implements methods described in the book: 'Chakraborty' (2017)
		ISBN:978-1482214840. Data collection paradigms include receiver
		operating characteristic ('ROC') and a location specific
		extension, namely free-response 'ROC' ('FROC'). 'ROC' data
		consists of a single rating per image, where the rating is the
		perceived confidence level the image is of a diseased patient.
		'FROC' data consists of a variable number (including zero) of
		mark-rating pairs per image, where a mark is the location of a
		clinically relevant suspicious region and the rating is the
		corresponding confidence level that it is a true lesion. The
		name 'RJafroc' is derived from it being an enhanced R version
		of original Windows 'JAFROC' http://www.devchakraborty.com.
		Implemented are a number of figures of merit quantifying
		performance, functions for visualizing operating
		characteristics and three ROC ratings data curve-fitting
		algorithms: the 'binormal' model ('BM'), the contaminated
		'binormal' model ('CBM') and the 'radiological' search model
		('RSM') 'Chakraborty' (2006) {doi:10.1088/0031-9155/51/14/012}
		. Also implemented is maximum likelihood fitting of paired ROC
		data, utilizing the correlated 'CBM' model ('CORCBM') model.
		Unlike the 'BM', which predicts 'improper' ROC curves, 'CBM',
		'CORCBM' and the 'RSM' predict proper ROC curves that do not
		cross the chance diagonal. 'RSM' fitting yields measures of
		search and lesion-classification performances, in addition to
		the usual case-classification performance measured by the area
		under the 'ROC' curve. Search performance is the ability to
		find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions. Lesion-
		classification performance is the ability to discriminate
		between found lesions and non-lesions. A number of significance
		testing algorithms are implement. For fully-crossed factorial
		study designs, termed multiple-reader multiple-case,
		significance testing of reader-averaged figure-of-merit
		differences between 'modalities' is implemented using either
		'pseudovalue'-based or figure of merit-based methods. Single
		treatment analysis allows comparison of performance of a group
		of radiologists to a specified value, or comparison of 'CAD'
		performance to a group of radiologists interpreting the same
		cases. Sample size estimation tools are provided for 'ROC' and
		'FROC' studies that allow estimation of relevant variances from
		a pilot study, in order to predict required numbers of readers
		and cases in a pivotal study. Utility and data file
		manipulation functions allow data to be read in any of the
		currently used input formats, including Excel, and the results
		of the analysis can be viewed in text or Excel output files.
