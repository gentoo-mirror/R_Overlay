		Two-Sample Empirical Likelihood // Empirical likelihood (EL)
		inference for two-sample problems. The following statistics are
		included: the difference of two-sample means, smooth Huber
		estimators, quantile (qdiff) and cumulative distribution
		functions (ddiff), probability-probability (P-P) and quantile-
		quantile (Q-Q) plots as well as receiver operating
		characteristic (ROC) curves. EL calculations are based on J.
