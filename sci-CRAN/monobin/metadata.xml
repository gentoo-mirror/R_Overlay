		Monotonic Binning for Credit Rating Models // Performs monotonic
		binning of numeric risk factor in credit rating models (PD,
		LGD, EAD) development. All functions handle both binary and
		continuous target variable. Functions that use isotonic
		regression in the first stage of binning process have an
		additional feature for correction of minimum percentage of
		observations and minimum target rate per bin. Additionally,
		monotonic trend can be identified based on raw data or, if
		known in advance, forced by functions' argument. Missing values
		and other possible special values are treated separately from
		so-called complete cases.
