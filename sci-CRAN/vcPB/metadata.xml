		Longitudinal PB Varying-Coefficient Groupwise Disparity Model //
		Estimating the disparity between two groups based on the
		extended model of the Peters-Belson (PB) method. Our model is
		the first work on the longitudinal data, and also can set a
		varying variable to find the complicated association between
		other variables and the varying variable. Our work is an
		extension of the Peters-Belson method which was originally
		published in Peters (1941)doi:10.1080/00220671.1941.10881036
		and Belson (1956)doi:10.2307/2985420.
