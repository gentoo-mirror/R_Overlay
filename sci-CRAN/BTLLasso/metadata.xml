		Modelling Heterogeneity in Paired Comparison Data // Performs
		'BTLLasso' as described by Schauberger and Tutz (2019)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v088.i09 and Schauberger and Tutz (2017)
		doi:10.1177/1471082X17693086. BTLLasso is a method to include
		different types of variables in paired comparison models and,
		therefore, to allow for heterogeneity between subjects.
		Variables can be subject-specific, object-specific and subject-
		object-specific and can have an influence on the
		attractiveness/strength of the objects. Suitable L1 penalty
		terms are used to cluster certain effects and to reduce the
		complexity of the models.
