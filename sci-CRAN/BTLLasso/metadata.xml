		Modelling Heterogeneity in Paired Comparison Data // Performs
		'BTLLasso', a method to include different types of variables in
		paired comparison models and, therefore, to allow for
		heterogeneity between subjects. Variables can be subject-
		specific, object-specific and subject-object-specific and can
		have an influence on the attractiveness/strength of the
		objects. Suitable L1 penalty terms are used to cluster certain
		effects and to reduce the complexity of the models.
