		Negative Binomial Beta t-Test // We constructed 'NBBttest' for
		identifying genes or RNA isoforms differentially expressed
		between two conditions on RNA-seq count data. Package
		'NBBttest' can  perform data quality check, data normalization,
		differential analysis, annotation and graphic analysis. In
		differential analysis, 'NBBttest' can identify differentially
		expressed genes and differential RNA isoforms in alternative
		splicing sites and alternative polyadenylation sites,
		differential sgRNA, and differential CRISPR (clustered
		regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) screening
		genes. In graphic analysis, 'NBBttest' provides two types of
		heatmaps to visualize differential expression at gene or
		isoform level using z-score and n-score and creates pathway
		heatmap. 'NBBttest' can plot differentially expressed exons
		within a specified gene. In addition, 'NBBttest' provides a
		tool for annotation of genes and exons. The methods used in
		'NBBttest' were new statistical methods developed from Tan and
		others (2015) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0123658. The statistical
		methods are robust and very powerful in identifying genes or
		RNA isoforms differentially expressed between two conditions in
		small samples.
