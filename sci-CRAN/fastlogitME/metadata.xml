		Basic Marginal Effects for Logit Models // Calculates marginal
		effects based on logistic model objects such as 'glm' or
		'speedglm' at the average (default) or at given values using
		finite differences. It also returns confidence intervals for
		said marginal effects and the p-values, which can easily be
		used as input in stargazer. The function only returns the
		essentials and is therefore much faster but not as detailed as
		other functions available to calculate marginal effects. As a
		result, it is highly suitable for large datasets for which
		other packages may require too much time or calculating power.
