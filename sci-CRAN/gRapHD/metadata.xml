		Efficient Selection of Undirected Graphical Models for High-
		Dimensional Datasets // Performs efficient selection of high-
		dimensional undirected graphical models as described in Abreu,
		Edwards and Labouriau (2010) doi:10.18637/jss.v037.i01.
		Provides tools for selecting trees, forests and decomposable
		models minimizing information criteria such as AIC or BIC, and
		for displaying the independence graphs of the models. It has
		also some useful tools for analysing graphical structures. It
		supports the use of discrete, continuous, or both types of
		variables.
