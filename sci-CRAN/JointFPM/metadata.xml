		A Parametric Model for Estimating the Mean Number of Events //
		Implementation of a parametric joint model for modelling
		recurrent and competing event processes using generalised
		survival models as described in Entrop et al., (2025)
		doi:10.1002/bimj.70038. The joint  model can subsequently be
		used to predict the mean number of events in the presence of
		competing risks at different time points. Comparisons of the
		mean number of event functions, e.g. the differences in mean
		number of events between two exposure groups, are also
		available.
