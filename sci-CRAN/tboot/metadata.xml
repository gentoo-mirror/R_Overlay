		Tilted Bootstrap // Creates simulated clinical trial data with
		realistic correlation structures and assumed efficacy levels by
		using a tilted bootstrap resampling approach. Samples are drawn
		from observed data with some samples appearing more frequently
		than others. May also be used for simulating from a joint
		Bayesian distribution along with clinical trials based on the
		Bayesian distribution.
