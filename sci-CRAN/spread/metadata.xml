		Infectious Disease Spread Models // A stochastic SEIIaR
		(susceptible, exposed, infectious, infectious asymptomatic,
		recovered) metapopulation model that including commuting. Each
		location has a local infection system, while the locations are
		connected by people who commute each day. The model
		differentiates between day and night. During the day you can
		infect/be infected in the location where you work, while during
		the night you can infect/be infected in the location where you
		live. It is the same commuters who travel back and forth each
		day. At the start of a day, all commuters are sent to their
		work location, where they mix for 12 hours. The commuters are
		then sent to their respective home locations, where they mix
		for 12 hours. The model is loosely based upon a published model
		by Engebretsen (2019) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006879.
