		Interpolation Methods // Bivariate data interpolation on regular
		and irregular grids, either linear or using splines are the
		main part of this package.  It is intended to provide FOSS
		replacement functions for the ACM licensed akima::interp and
		tripack::tri.mesh functions. Linear interpolation is
		implemented in interp::interp(..., method="linear"), this
		corresponds to the call akima::interp(..., linear=TRUE) which
		is the default setting and covers most of akima::interp use
		cases in depending packages. A re-implementation of Akimas
		irregular grid spline interpolation (akima::interp(...,
		linear=FALSE)) is now also available via interp::interp(...,
		method="akima"). Estimators for partial derivatives are now
		also available in interp::locpoly(), these are a prerequisite
		for the spline interpolation. The basic part is a GPLed
		triangulation algorithm (sweep hull algorithm by David
		Sinclair) providing the starting point for the irregular grid
		interpolator. As side effect this algorithm is also used to
		provide replacements for almost all functions of the tripack
		package which also suffers from the same ACM license
		restrictions. All functions are designed to be backward
		compatible with their akima / tripack counterparts.
