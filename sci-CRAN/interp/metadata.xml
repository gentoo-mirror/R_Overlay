		Interpolation Methods // Bivariate data interpolation on regular
		and irregular grids, either linear or using splines are the
		main part of this package.  It is intended to provide FOSS
		replacement functions for the ACM licensed akima::interp and
		tripack::tri.mesh functions. Currently the piecewise linear
		interpolation part of akima::interp (and also akima::interpp)
		is implemented in interp::interp, this corresponds to the call
		akima::interp(..., linear=TRUE) which is the default setting
		and covers most of akima::interp use cases in depending
		packages.  A re-implementation of Akimas spline interpolation
		(akima::interp(..., linear=FALSE)) is currently under
		development and will complete this package in a later version.
		Estimators for partial derivatives are already available, these
		are a prerequisite for the spline interpolation.  The basic
		part is currently a GPLed triangulation algorithm (sweep hull
		algorithm by David Sinclair) providing the starting point for
		the piecewise linear interpolator. As side effect this
		algorithm is also used to provide replacements for the basic
		functions of the tripack package which also suffer from the ACM
		restrictions.  All functions are designed to be backward
		compatible with their akima / tripack counterparts.
