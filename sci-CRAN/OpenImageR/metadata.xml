		An Image Processing Toolkit // Incorporates functions for image
		preprocessing, filtering and image recognition. The package
		takes advantage of 'RcppArmadillo' to speed up computationally
		intensive functions. The histogram of oriented gradients
		descriptor is a modification of the 'findHOGFeatures' function
		of the 'SimpleCV' computer vision platform, the average_hash(),
		dhash() and phash() functions are based on the 'ImageHash'
		python library and the Gabor Feature Extraction functions are
		based on 'Matlab' code of the paper, "CloudID: Trustworthy
		cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification" by
		M. Haghighat, S. Zonouz, M. Abdel-Mottaleb, Expert Systems with
		Applications, vol. 42, no. 21, pp. 7905-7916, 2015,
		doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025.
