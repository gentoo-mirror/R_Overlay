		An Image Processing Toolkit // Incorporates functions for image
		preprocessing, filtering and image recognition. The package
		takes advantage of 'RcppArmadillo' to speed up computationally
		intensive functions. The histogram of oriented gradients
		descriptor is a modification of the 'findHOGFeatures' function
		of the 'SimpleCV' computer vision platform, the average_hash(),
		dhash() and phash() functions are based on the 'ImageHash'
		python library. The Gabor Feature Extraction functions are
		based on 'Matlab' code of the paper, "CloudID: Trustworthy
		cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification" by
		M. Haghighat, S. Zonouz, M. Abdel-Mottaleb, Expert Systems with
		Applications, vol. 42, no. 21, pp. 7905-7916, 2015,
		doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025. The 'SLIC' and 'SLICO'
		superpixel algorithms were explained in detail in (i) "SLIC
		Superpixels Compared to State-of-the-art Superpixel Methods",
		Radhakrishna Achanta, Appu Shaji, Kevin Smith, Aurelien Lucchi,
		Pascal Fua, and Sabine Suesstrunk, IEEE Transactions on Pattern
		Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 34, num. 11, p.
		2274-2282, May 2012, doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2012.120 and (ii) "SLIC
		Superpixels", Radhakrishna Achanta, Appu Shaji, Kevin Smith,
		Aurelien Lucchi, Pascal Fua, and Sabine Suesstrunk, EPFL
		Technical Report no. 149300, June 2010.
