		Fast and Exact Algorithms for Computing Phylogenetic Biodiversity
		Measures // Given a phylogenetic tree T and an assemblage S of
		species represented as a subset of tips in T, we want to
		compute a measure of the diversity of the species in S with
		respect to T. The current package offers efficient algorithms
		that can process large phylogenetic data for several such
		measures. Most importantly, the package includes algorithms for
		computing efficiently the standardized versions of phylogenetic
		measures and their p-values, which are essential for null model
		comparisons. Among other functions, the package provides
		efficient computation of richness-standardized versions for
		indices such as the net relatedness index (NRI), nearest taxon
		index (NTI), phylogenetic diversity index (PDI), and the
		corresponding indices of two-sample measures. The package also
		introduces a new single-sample measure, the Core Ancestor Cost
		(CAC); the package provides functions for computing the value
		and the standardised index of the CAC and, more than that,
		there is an extra function available that can compute exactly
		any statistical moment of the measure. The package supports
		computations under different null models, including abundance-
		weighted models.
