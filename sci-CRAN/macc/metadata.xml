		Mediation Analysis of Causality under Confounding // Performs
		causal mediation analysis under confounding or correlated
		errors. This package includes a single level mediation model, a
		two-level mediation model, and a three-level mediation model
		for data with hierarchical structures. Under the two/three-
		level mediation model, the correlation parameter is
		identifiable and is estimated based on a hierarchical-
		likelihood, a marginal-likelihood or a two-stage method. See
		Zhao, Y.,  Luo, X. (2014), Estimating Mediation Effects under
		Correlated Errors with an Application to fMRI, arXiv:1410.7217
		for details.
