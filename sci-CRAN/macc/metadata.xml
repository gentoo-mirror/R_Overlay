		Mediation Analysis of Causality under Confounding // Performs
		causal mediation analysis under confounding or correlated
		errors. This package includes a single level mediation model, a
		two-level mediation model, and a three-level mediation model
		for data with hierarchical structures. Under the two/three-
		level mediation model, the correlation parameter is
		identifiable and is estimated based on a hierarchical-
		likelihood, a marginal-likelihood or a two-stage method. See
		reference for details (Zhao, Y.,  Luo, X. (2014). Estimating
		Mediation Effects under Correlated Errors with an Application
		to fMRI. arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.7217.
