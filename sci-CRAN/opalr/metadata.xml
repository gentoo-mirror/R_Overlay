		Opal R and Datashield Utils // Data integration Web application
		for biobanks by OBiBa. Opal is OBiBa's core database
		application for biobanks. Participant data, once collected from
		any data source, must be integrated and stored in a central
		data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central
		repository. It can import, process, validate, query, analyze,
		report, and export data. Opal is typically used in a research
		center to analyze the data acquired at assessment centres. Its
		ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless data-sharing among
		biobanks.
