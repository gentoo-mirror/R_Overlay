		'Opal' Data Repository Client and 'DataSHIELD' Utils // Data
		integration Web application for biobanks by 'OBiBa'. 'Opal' is
		the core database application for biobanks. Participant data,
		once collected from any data source, must be integrated and
		stored in a central data repository under a uniform model.
		'Opal' is such a central repository. It can import, process,
		validate, query, analyze, report, and export data. 'Opal' is
		typically used in a research center to analyze the data
		acquired at assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to
		achieve seamless data-sharing among biobanks. This 'Opal'
		client allows to interact with 'Opal' web services and to
		perform operations on the R server side. 'DataSHIELD'
		administration tools are also provided.
