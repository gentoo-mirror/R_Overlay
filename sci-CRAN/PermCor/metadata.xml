		Robust Permutation Tests of Correlation Coefficients // Provides
		tools for statistical testing of correlation coefficients
		through robust permutation method and large sample
		approximation method. Tailored to different types of
		correlation coefficients including Pearson correlation
		coefficient, weighted Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman
		correlation coefficient, and Lin's concordance correlation
		coefficient.The robust permutation test controls type I error
		under general scenarios when sample size is small and two
		variables are dependent but uncorrelated. The large sample
		approximation test generally controls type I error when the
		sample size is large (200).
