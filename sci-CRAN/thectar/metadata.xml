		Hermeneutic Content Analysis // A collection of tools for
		performing the second step of Hermeneutic Content Analysis
		(HCA; see Bergman, 2010, doi:10.4135/9781506335193). The
		current version provides tools for implementing
		multidimensional scaling (MDS) within an HCA framework. The
		tools offer assistance in data preparation, modeling, and
		interpretation of MDS maps. The data preparation tools help
		users to create similarity matrices based on co-occurrence or
		sorting data. The modelling tools allow users to optimize the
		modelling process by systematically calculating Stress values
		for a set of p points out of n points. The tools assisting
		interpretation allow users to highlight the highest
		similarities either per point or overall in an MDS
		representation.
