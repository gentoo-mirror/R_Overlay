		Shape Analysis for AI-Reconstructed Images // Provides
		functionality for image processing and shape analysis in the
		context of reconstructed medical images generated by deep
		learning-based methods or standard image processing algorithms
		and produced from different medical imaging types, such as
		X-ray, Computational Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance
		Imaging (MRI), and pathology imaging. Specifically, offers
		tools to segment regions of interest and to extract
		quantitative shape descriptors for applications in signal
		processing, statistical analysis and modeling, and machine
		learning.
