		Extract Matching Lines from Matching Files // Provides a simple
		interface to recursively list files from a directory, filter
		them using a regular expression, read their contents, and
		extract lines that match a user-defined pattern. The package
		returns a dataframe containing the matched lines, their line
		numbers, file paths, and the corresponding matched substrings.
		Designed for quick code base exploration, log inspection, or
		any use case involving pattern-based file and line filtering.
