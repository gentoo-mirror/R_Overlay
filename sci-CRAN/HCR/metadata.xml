		Causal Discovery from Discrete Data using Hidden Compact
		Representation // This code provides a method to fit the hidden
		compact representation model as well as to identify the causal
		direction on discrete data. We implement an effective solution
		to recover the above hidden compact representation under the
		likelihood framework. Please see the Causal Discovery from
		Discrete Data using Hidden Compact Representation from NIPS
		2018 by Ruichu Cai, Jie Qiao, Kun Zhang, Zhenjie Zhang and
		Zhifeng Hao (2018)
		https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=11274 for a
		description of some of our methods.
