		Ada-Plot and Uda-Plot for Assessing Distributional Attributes and
		Normality // The centralized empirical cumulative average
		deviation function is utilized to develop both Ada-plot and
		Uda-plot as alternatives to Ad-plot and Ud-plot introduced by
		the author. Analogous to Ad-plot, Ada-plot can identify
		symmetry, skewness, and outliers of the data distribution. The
		Uda-plot is as exceptional as Ud-plot in assessing normality.
		The d-value that quantifies the degree of proximity between the
		Uda-plot and the graph of the estimated normal density function
		helps guide to make decisions on confirmation of normality.
		Extreme values in the data can be eliminated using the 1.5IQR
		rule to create its robust version if user demands. Full
		description of the methodology can be found in the article by
		Wijesuriya (2025a) doi:10.1080/03610926.2025.2558108. Further,
		the development of Ad-plot and Ud-plot is contained in both
		article and the 'adplots' R package by Wijesuriya (2025b
		2025c) doi:10.1080/03610926.2024.2440583 and
		doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.adplots.
