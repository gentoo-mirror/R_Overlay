		Utilities for Scoring and Assessing Predictions // Facilitate the
		evaluation of forecasts in a convenient framework based on
		data.table. It allows user to to check their forecasts and
		diagnose issues, to visualise forecasts and missing data, to
		transform data before scoring, to handle missing forecasts, to
		aggregate scores, and to visualise the results of the
		evaluation. The package mostly focuses on the evaluation of
		probabilistic forecasts and allows evaluating several different
		forecast types and input formats. Find more information about
		the package in the Vignettes as well as in the accompanying
		paper, doi:10.48550/arXiv.2205.07090.
