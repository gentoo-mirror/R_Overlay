		Utilities for Scoring and Assessing Predictions // Provides a
		collection of metrics and proper scoring rules (Tilmann
		Gneiting  Adrian E Raftery (2007)
		doi:10.1198/016214506000001437, Jordan, A., Krger, F.,  Lerch,
		S. (2019) doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i12) within a consistent
		framework for evaluation, comparison and visualisation of
		forecasts. In addition to proper scoring rules, functions are
		provided to assess bias, sharpness and calibration (Sebastian
		Funk, Anton Camacho, Adam J. Kucharski, Rachel Lowe, Rosalind
		M. Eggo, W. John Edmunds (2019)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006785) of forecasts. Several types
		of predictions (e.g. binary, discrete, continuous) which may
		come in different formats (e.g. forecasts represented by
		predictive samples or by quantiles of the predictive
		distribution) can be evaluated. Scoring metrics can be used
		either through a convenient data.frame format, or can be
		applied as individual functions in a vector / matrix format.
		All functionality has been implemented with a focus on
		performance and is robustly tested. Find more information about
		the package in the accompanying paper
		(doi:10.48550/arXiv.2205.07090).
