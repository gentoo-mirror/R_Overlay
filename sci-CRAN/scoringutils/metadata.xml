		Utilities for Scoring and Assessing Predictions // Combines a
		collection of metrics and proper scoring rules (Tilmann
		Gneiting  Adrian E Raftery (2007)
		doi:10.1198/016214506000001437) with an easy to use wrapper
		that can be used to automatically evaluate predictions. Apart
		from proper scoring rules functions are provided to assess
		bias, sharpness and calibration (Sebastian Funk, Anton Camacho,
		Adam J. Kucharski, Rachel Lowe, Rosalind M. Eggo, W. John
		Edmunds (2019) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006785) of forecasts.
		Several types of predictions can be evaluated: probabilistic
		forecasts (generally predictive samples generated by Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo procedures), quantile forecasts or point
		forecasts. Observed values and predictions can be either
		continuous, integer, or binary. Users can either choose to
		apply these rules separately in a vector / matrix format that
		can be flexibly used within other packages, or they can choose
		to do an automatic evaluation of their forecasts. This is
		implemented with 'data.table' and provides a consistent and
		very efficient framework for evaluating various types of
		predictions.
