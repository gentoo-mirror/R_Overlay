		Calculate Pairwise Multiple Comparisons of Mean Rank Sums //
		Note, that the 'PMCMR' package is superseded by the novel
		'PMCMRplus' package. The 'PMCMRplus' package contains all
		functions from 'PMCMR' and many more parametric and non-
		parametric multiple comparison procedures, one-factorial trend
		tests, as well as improved method functions, such as print,
		summary and plot. The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained,
		but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for
		some time.
