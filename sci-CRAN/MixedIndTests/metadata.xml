		Tests of Randomness and Tests of Independence // Functions for
		testing randomness for a univariate time series with arbitrary
		distribution  (discrete, continuous, mixture of both types) and
		for testing  independence between random variables with
		arbitrary distributions. The test statistics are based on the
		multilinear empirical copula and multipliers are used to
		compute P-values. The test of independence between random
		variables appeared in  Genest, Nelehov, Rmillard  Murphy
		(2019).
