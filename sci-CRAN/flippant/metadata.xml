		Dithionite Scramblase Assay Analysis // The lipid scrambling
		activity of protein extracts and purified scramblases is often
		determined using a fluorescence-based assay involving many
		manual steps. flippant offers an integrated solution for the
		analysis and publication-grade graphical presentation of
		dithionite scramblase assays, as well as a platform for review,
		dissemination and extension of the strategies it employs. The
		package's name derives from a play on the fact that lipid
		scrambling is also sometimes referred to as 'flipping'. The
		package is originally published as Cotton, R.J., Ploier, B.,
		Goren, M.A., Menon, A.K., and Graumann, J. (2017). "flippantAn
		R package for the automated analysis of fluorescence-based
		scramblase assays." BMC Bioinformatics 18, 146.
		DOI:10.1186/s12859-017-1542-y.
