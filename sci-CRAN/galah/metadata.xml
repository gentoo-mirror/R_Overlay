		Biodiversity Data from the GBIF Node Network // The Global
		Biodiversity Information Facility ('GBIF',
		https://www.gbif.org) sources data from an international
		network of data providers, known as 'nodes'. Several of these
		nodes - the "living atlases" (https://living-atlases.gbif.org)
		- maintain their own web services using software originally
		developed by the Atlas of Living Australia ('ALA',
		https://www.ala.org.au). 'galah' enables the R community to
		directly access data and resources hosted by 'GBIF' and its
		partner nodes.
