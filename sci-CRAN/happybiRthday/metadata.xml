		Calculate Upcoming Birthday Dates of Github Repos // Software
		creation is a pretty big deal!  A repository's initial commit
		date can be thought of as its birthday.  Next time, drop in and
		wish a developer (any Github username) a happy birthday of
		their repo(s).  Or maybe just toast to the upcoming anniversary
		of your own software!  The software life cycle is too short not
		to celebrate!
