		Bayesian Model Selection under Constraints // A Bayesian
		regression package supporting constrained coefficient
		estimation and variable selection using Stan. This includes a
		robust variable selection algorithm by a horseshoe prior
		(doi:10.1093/biomet/asq017) that finds the optimal model
		considering main effects, interactions as well as powers of
		given variables under potential parameter constraints.
