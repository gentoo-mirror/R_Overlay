		A Utility Package to Help you Deal with "Pignas" // Pigna
		[_pn'n'a_] is the Italian word for pine cone.  In jargon, it is
		used to identify a task which is boring, banal, annoying,
		painful, frustrating and maybe even with a not so beautiful or
		rewarding result, just like the obstinate act of trying to
		challenge yourself in extracting pine nuts from a pine cone,
		provided that, in the end, you will find at least one inside
		it. Here you can find a backpack of functions to be used to
		solve small everyday problems of coding or analyzing (clinical)
		data, which would be normally solved using quick-and-dirty
		patches. You will be able to convert 'Hmisc' and 'rms'
		summary()es into data.frames ready to be rendered by 'pander'
		and 'knitr'. You can access easy-to-use wrappers to activate
		essential but useful progress bars (from 'progress') into your
		loops or functionals. Easy setup and control Telegram's bots
		(from 'telegram.bot') to send messages or to divert error
		messages to a Telegram's chat. You also have some utilities
		helping you in the development of packages, like the activation
		of the same user interface of 'usethis' into your package, or
		call polite functions to ask a user to install other packages.
		Finally, you find a set of thematic sets of packages you may
		use to set up new environments quickly, installing them in a
		single call.
