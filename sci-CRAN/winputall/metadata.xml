		Variable Input Allocation Among Crops // Using a time-varying
		random parameters model developed in Koutchade et al., (2024)
		https://hal.science/hal-04318163, this package allows
		allocating variable input costs among crops produced by farmers
		based on panel data including information on input expenditure
		aggregated at the farm level and acreage shares. It also
		considers in fairly way the weighting data and can allow
		integrating time-varying and time-constant control variables.
