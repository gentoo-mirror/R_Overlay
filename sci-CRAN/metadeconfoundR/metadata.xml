		Covariate-Sensitive Analysis of Cross-Sectional High-Dimensional
		Data // Using non-parametric tests, naive associations between
		omics features and metadata in cross-sectional data-sets are
		detected. In a second step, confounding effects between
		metadata associated to the same omics feature are detected and
		labeled using nested post-hoc model comparison tests, as first
		described in Forslund, Chakaroun, Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, et al.
		(2021) doi:10.1038/s41586-021-04177-9. The generated output can
		be graphically summarized using the built-in plotting function.
