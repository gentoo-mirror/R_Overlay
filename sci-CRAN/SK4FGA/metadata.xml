		Scott-Knott for Forensic Glass Analysis // In forensics, it is
		common and effective practice to analyse glass fragments from
		the scene and suspects to gain evidence of placing a suspect at
		the crime scene. This kind of analysis involves comparing the
		physical and chemical attributes of glass fragments that exist
		on both the person and at the crime scene, and assessing the
		significance in a likeness that they share. The package
		implements the Scott-Knott Modification 2 algorithm (SKM2)
		(Christopher M. Triggs and James M. Curran and John S.
		Buckleton and Kevan A.J. Walsh (1997)

		forensic glass analysis: a divisive approach", Forensic Science
		International, 85(1), 1--14) for small sample glass fragment
		analysis using the refractive index (ri) of a set of glass
		samples. It also includes an experimental multivariate analog
		to the Scott-Knott algorithm for similar analysis on glass
		samples with multiple chemical concentration variables and
		multiple samples of the same item; testing against the
		Hotellings T^2 distribution (J.M. Curran and C.M. Triggs and
		J.R. Almirall and J.S. Buckleton and K.A.J. Walsh (1997)
		doi:10.1016/S1355-0306(97)72197-X "The interpretation of
		elemental composition measurements from forensic glass
		evidence", Science  Justice, 37(4), 241--244).
