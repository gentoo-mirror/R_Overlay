		Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Multinomial Proportions //
		Several authors have proposed methods for constructing
		simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions.
		The package implements seven classical approachesWilson,
		Quesenberry and Hurst, Goodman, Wald (with and without
		continuity correction), Fitzpatrick and Scott, and Sison and
		Glazalong with Bayesian methods based on Dirichlet models. Both
		equal and unequal Dirichlet priors are supported, providing a
		broad framework for inference, data analysis, and sensitivity
		evaluation.
