		Simulation of Single Cell RNA-Seq Data with Complex Structure //
		Simulating single cell RNA-seq data with complicated structure.
		This package is developed based on the Splat method (Zappia,
		Phipson and Oshlack (2017) doi:10.1186/s13059-017-1305-0).
		'GeneScape' incorporates additional features to simulate single
		cell RNA-seq data with complicated differential expression and
		correlation structures, such as sub-cell-types, correlated
		genes (pathway genes) and hub genes.
