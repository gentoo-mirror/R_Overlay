		Multiple Hypotheses Testing for Discrete Data // A Comprehensive
		tool for almost all existing multiple testing methods for
		discrete data. The package also provides some novel multiple
		testing procedures controlling FWER/FDR for discrete data.
		Given discrete p-values and their domains, the
		[method].p.adjust function returns adjusted p-values, which can
		be used to compare with the nominal significant level alpha and
		make decisions. For users' convenience, the functions also
		provide the output option for printing decision rules.
