		Combined Visualisation of Phylogenetic and Epidemiological Data
		// A collection of utilities and 'ggplot2' extensions to assist
		with visualisations in genomic epidemiology. This includes the
		'phylepic' chart, a visual combination of a phylogenetic tree
		and a matched epidemic curve. The included 'ggplot2' extensions
		such as date axes binned by week are relevant for other
		applications in epidemiology and beyond. The approach is
		described in Suster et al. (2024)
