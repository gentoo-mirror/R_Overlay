		Estimation and Inference for Heckman Selection Models with
		Cluster-Robust Variance // Tools for the estimation of Heckman
		selection models with robust variance-covariance matrices. It
		includes functions for computing the bread and meat matrices,
		as well as clustered standard errors for generalized Heckman
		models, see Fernando de Souza Bastos and Wagner Barreto-Souza
		and Marc G. Genton (2022, ISSN:
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/27164235). The package also offers
		cluster-robust inference with sandwich estimators, and tools
		for handling issues related to eigenvalues in covariance
		matrices.
