		Visualize Spatiotemporal Tumor Evolution with Jellyfish Plots //
		Generates interactive Jellyfish plots to visualize
		spatiotemporal tumor evolution by integrating sample and
		phylogenetic trees into a unified plot. This approach provides
		an intuitive way to analyze tumor heterogeneity and evolution
		over time and across anatomical locations. The Jellyfish plot
		visualization design was first introduced by Lahtinen, Lavikka,
		et al. (2023, doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2023.04.017). This package
		also supports visualizing ClonEvol results, a tool developed by
		Dang, et al. (2017, doi:10.1093/annonc/mdx517), for analyzing
		clonal evolution from multi-sample sequencing data. The
		'clonevol' package is not available on CRAN but can be
		installed from its GitHub repository
		(https://github.com/hdng/clonevol).
