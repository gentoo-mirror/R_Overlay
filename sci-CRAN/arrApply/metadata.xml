		Apply a Function to a Margin of an Array // High performance
		variant of apply() for a fixed set of functions. Considerable
		speedup is a trade-off for universality, user defined functions
		cannot be used with this package. However, 21 most currently
		employed functions are available for usage. They can be divided
		in three types: reducing functions (like mean(), sum() etc.,
		giving a scalar when applied to a vector), mapping function
		(like normalise(), cumsum() etc., giving a vector of the same
		length as the input vector) and finally, vector reducing
		function (like diff() which produces result vector of a length
		different from the length of input vector). Optional or
		mandatory additional arguments required by some functions (e.g.
		norm type for norm() or normalise() functions) can be passed as
		named arguments in '...'.
