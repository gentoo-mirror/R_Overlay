		Fast Gaussian Process Computation Using Vecchia's Approximation
		// Functions for fitting and doing predictions with Gaussian
		process models using Vecchia's (1988) approximation. Package
		also includes functions for reordering input locations, finding
		ordered nearest neighbors (with help from 'FNN' package),
		grouping operations, and conditional simulations. Covariance
		functions for spatial and spatial-temporal data on Euclidean
		domains and spheres are provided. The original approximation is
		due to Vecchia (1988) http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345768, and
		the reordering and grouping methods are from Guinness (2018)
		doi:10.1080/00401706.2018.1437476. Model fitting employs a
		Fisher scoring algorithm described in Guinness (2019)
