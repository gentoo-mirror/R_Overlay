		Fast Gaussian Process Computation Using Vecchia's Approximation
		// Functions for reordering input locations, finding ordered
		nearest neighbors (with help from 'FNN' package), grouping
		operations, approximate likelihood evaluations, profile
		likelihoods, Gaussian process predictions, and conditional
		simulations. Covariance functions for spatial and spatial-
		temporal data on Euclidean domains and spheres are provided.
		The original approximation is due to Vecchia (1988)
		http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345768, and the reordering and
		grouping methods are from Guinness (2018)
