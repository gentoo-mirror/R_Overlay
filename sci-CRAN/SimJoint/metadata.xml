		Simulate Joint Distribution // Simulate multivariate correlated
		data given nonparametric marginals and their joint structure
		characterized by a Pearson or Spearman correlation matrix. The
		simulator engages the problem from a purely computational
		perspective. It assumes no statistical models such as copulas
		or parametric distributions, and can approximate the target
		correlations regardless of theoretical feasibility. The
		algorithm integrates and advances the Iman-Conover (1982)
		approach doi:10.1080/03610918208812265 and the Ruscio-Kaczetow
		iteration (2008) doi:10.1080/00273170802285693. Package
		functions are carefully implemented in C++ for squeezing
		computing speed, suitable for large input in a manycore
		environment. Precision of the approximation and computing speed
		both substantially outperform various CRAN packages to date.
		Benchmarks are detailed in function examples. A simple
		heuristic algorithm is additionally designed to optimize the
		joint distribution in the post-simulation stage. The heuristic
		demonstrated good potential of achieving the same level of
		precision of approximation without the enhanced Iman-Conover-
		Ruscio-Kaczetow. The package contains a copy of Permuted
		Congruential Generator.
