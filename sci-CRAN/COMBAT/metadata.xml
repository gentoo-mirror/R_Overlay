		A Combined Association Test for Genes using Summary Statistics //
		Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used
		for identifying common variants associated with complex
		diseases. Due to the small effect sizes of common variants, the
		power to detect individual risk variants is generally low.
		Complementary to SNP-level analysis, a variety of gene-based
		association tests have been proposed. However, the power of
		existing gene-based tests is often dependent on the underlying
		genetic models, and it is not known a priori which test is
		optimal.  Here we proposed COMBined Association Test (COMBAT)
		to incorporate strengths from multiple existing gene-based
		tests, including VEGAS, GATES and simpleM. Compared to
		individual tests, COMBAT shows higher overall performance and
		robustness across a wide range of genetic models. The algorithm
		behind this method is described in Wang et al (2017)
