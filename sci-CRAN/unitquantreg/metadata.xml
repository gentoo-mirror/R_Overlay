		Parametric Quantile Regression Models for Bounded Data // A
		collection of parametric quantile regression models for bounded
		data. At present, the package provides 13 parametric quantile
		regression models. It can specify regression structure for any
		quantile and shape parameters. It also provides several S3
		methods to extract information from fitted model, such as
		residual analysis, prediction, plotting, and model comparison.
		For more computation efficient the [dpqr]'s, likelihood, score
		and hessian functions are written in C++. For further details
		see Mazucheli et. al (2022) doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106816.
