		Environmental Sciences // Tools for multivariate data analysis.
		Several methods are provided for the analysis (i.e.,
		ordination) of one-table (e.g., principal component analysis,
		correspondence analysis), two-table (e.g., coinertia analysis,
		redundancy analysis), three-table (e.g., RLQ analysis) and
		K-table (e.g., STATIS, multiple coinertia analysis). The
		philosophy of the package is described in Dray and Dufour
		(2007) doi:10.18637/jss.v022.i04.
