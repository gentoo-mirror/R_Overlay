		Thematic Cartography // Create and integrate maps in your R
		workflow. This package helps to design cartographic
		representations such as proportional symbols, choropleth,
		typology, flows or discontinuities maps. It also offers several
		features that improve the graphic presentation of maps, for
		instance, map palettes, layout elements (scale, north arrow,
		title...), labels or legends. See Giraud and Lambert (2017)
