		Analyzing the Opinions in a Big Text Document // Designed for
		performing impact analysis of opinions in a digital text
		document (DTD). The package allows a user to assess the extent
		to which a theme or subject within a document impacts the
		overall opinion expressed in the document. The package can be
		applied to a wide range of opinion-based DTD, including
		commentaries on social media platforms (such as 'Facebook',
		'Twitter' and 'Youtube'), online products reviews, and so on.
		The utility of 'opitools' was originally demonstrated in
		Adepeju and Jimoh (2021) doi:10.31235/osf.io/c32qh in the
		assessment of COVID-19 impacts on neighbourhood policing using
		Twitter data. Further examples can be found in the vignette of
		the package.
