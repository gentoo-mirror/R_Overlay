		Install the 'Natverse' Packages from Scratch // Enables user to
		install different packages in the 'natverse' repository from
		scratch. The rationale behind the utility of this package is as
		follows. The suite of packages encompassed by 'natverse' helps
		in analysing neuroanatomical data ranging from a variety of
		species like the nematode worm to the mouse brain. The
		principal problem while installing the core 'natverse' package
		is that it installs a lot of its friends (dependencies, imports
		etc.) that are required for its proper functioning. Most of
		these friends are development packages (which are also quite
		heavy) located in GITHUB. This in turn makes the installation
		of 'natverse' to have a lot of API calls to the GITHUB, however
		GITHUB has a limit of 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated
		requests. Hence for the unauthenticated user, the installation
		would fail if it was done directly. The proper way to fix this
		problem would be to set the GITHUB_PAT to make the request
		authenticated. Hence, to make the installation of 'natverse'
		easier from the end user perspective (who are not well versed
		in R or in GITHUB), we have developed this package. This
		package will act as a wrapper that will set the  GITHUB_PAT and
		will handhold the user to initiate the installation of the
		'natverse' packages.
