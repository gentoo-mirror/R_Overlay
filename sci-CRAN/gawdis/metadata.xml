		Multi-Trait Dissimilarity with more Uniform Contributions // R
		function gawdis() produces multi-trait dissimilarity with more
		uniform contributions of different traits. de Bello et al.
		(2021) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13537 presented the approach based
		on minimizing the differences in the correlation between the
		dissimilarity of each trait, or groups of traits, and the
		multi-trait dissimilarity. This is done using either an
		analytic or a numerical solution, both available in the
		function.
