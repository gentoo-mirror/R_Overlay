		Multi-Trait Dissimilarity with more Uniform Contributions // R
		function gawdis() produces multi-trait dissimilarity with more
		uniform contributions of different traits. The approach is
		based on minimizing the differences in the correlation between
		the dissimilarity of each trait, or groups of traits, and the
		multi-trait dissimilarity. This is done using either an
		analytic or a numerical solution, both available in the
		function.
