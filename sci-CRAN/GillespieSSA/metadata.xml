		Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) // Provides a
		simple to use, intuitive, and extensible interface to several
		stochastic simulation algorithms for generating simulated
		trajectories of finite population continuous-time model.
		Currently it implements Gillespie's exact stochastic simulation
		algorithm (Direct method) and several approximate methods
		(Explicit tau-leap, Binomial tau-leap, and Optimized tau-leap).
		The package also contains a library of template models that can
		be run as demo models and can easily be customized and
		extended. Currently the following models are included,
		'Decaying-Dimerization' reaction set, linear chain system,
		logistic growth model, 'Lotka' predator-prey model, Rosenzweig-
		MacArthur predator-prey model, 'Kermack-McKendrick' SIR model,
		and a 'metapopulation' SIRS model. Pineda-Krch et al. (2008)
