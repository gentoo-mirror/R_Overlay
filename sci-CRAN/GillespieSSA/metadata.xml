		Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) // GillespieSSA
		provides a simple to use, intuitive, and extensible interface
		to several stochastic simulation algorithms for generating
		simulated trajectories of finite population continuous-time
		model. Currently it implements Gillespie's exact stochastic
		simulation algorithm (Direct method) and several approximate
		methods (Explicit tau-leap, Binomial tau-leap, and Optimized
		tau-leap). The package also contains a library of template
		models that can be run as demo models and can easily be
		customized and extended. Currently the following models are
		included, decaying-dimerization reaction set, linear chain
		system, logistic growth model, Lotka predator-prey model,
		Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, Kermack-McKendrick
		SIR model, and a metapopulation SIRS model.
