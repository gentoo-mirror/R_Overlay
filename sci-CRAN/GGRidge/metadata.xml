		Graphical Group Ridge // The Graphical Group Ridge 'GGRidge'
		package package classifies ridge regression predictors in
		disjoint groups of conditionally correlated variables and
		derives different penalties (shrinkage parameters) for these
		groups of predictors. It combines the ridge regression method
		with the graphical model for high-dimensional data (i.e. the
		number of predictors exceeds the number of cases) or ill-
		conditioned data (e.g. in the presence of multicollinearity
		among predictors). The package reduces the mean square errors
		and the extent of over-shrinking of predictors as compared to
		the ridge method.Aldahmani, S. and Zoubeidi, T. (2020)
