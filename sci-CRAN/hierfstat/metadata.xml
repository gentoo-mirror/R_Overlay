		Estimation and Tests of Hierarchical F-Statistics // Estimates
		hierarchical F-statistics from haploid or diploid genetic data
		with any numbers of levels in the hierarchy, following the
		algorithm of Yang (Evolution(1998), 52:950). Tests via
		randomisations the significance of each F and variance
		components, using the likelihood-ratio statistics G (Goudet et
		al. (1996)
		https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/144/4/1933/6017091).
		Estimates genetic diversity statistics for haploid and diploid
		genetic datasets in various formats, including inbreeding and
		coancestry coefficients, and population specific F-statistics
		following Weir and Goudet (2017)
