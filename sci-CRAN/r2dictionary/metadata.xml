		A Mini-Dictionary for 'R', 'shiny' and 'rmarkdown' Documents //
		Despite the predominant use of R for data manipulation and
		various robust statistical calculations, in recent years, more
		people from various disciplines are beginning to use R for
		other purposes. In doing this seemlessly, further tools are
		needed users to easily and freely write in R for all kinds of
		purposes. The r2dictionary introduces a means for users to
		directly search for definitions of terms within the R
		environment.
