		A Mini-Dictionary for 'R', 'Shiny' and 'Rmarkdown' Documents //
		Despite the predominant use of R for data manipulation and
		various robust statistical calculations, in recent years, more
		people from various disciplines are beginning to use R for
		other purposes. A critical milestone that has enabled large
		influx of users in the R community is the development of the
		Tidyverse family of packages and Rmarkdown. With the latter,
		one can write all kinds of documents and produce output in
		formats such html and pdf very easily. In doing this
		seemlessly, further tools are needed for such users to easily
		and freely write in R for all kinds of purposes. The
		r2dictionary introduces a means for users to directly search
		for definitions of terms within the R environment.
