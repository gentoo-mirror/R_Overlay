		Goodness of Fit Based on Empirical Distribution Function // This
		repository contains software for the calculation of goodness-
		of-fit test statistics and their P-values. The three statistics
		computed are the Empirical Distribution function statistics
		called Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, and Watson
		statistics. The statistics and their P-values can be used to
		assess an assumed distribution.The following distributions are
		available: Uniform, Normal, Gamma, Logistic, Laplace, Weibull,
		Extreme Value, and Exponential.
