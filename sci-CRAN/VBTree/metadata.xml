		Vector Binary Tree to Make Your Data Management More Efficient //
		Vector binary tree provides a new data structure, to make your
		data visiting and management more efficient. If the data has
		structured column names, it can read these names and factorize
		them through specific split pattern, then build the mappings
		within double list, vector binary tree, array and tensor
		mutually, through which the batched data processing is
		achievable easily. The methods of array and tensor are also
		applicable. Detailed methods are described in Chen Zhang et al.
