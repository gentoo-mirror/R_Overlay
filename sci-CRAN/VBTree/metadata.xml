		Vector Binary Tree to Make Your Data Management More Efficient //
		Provides a new data structure, vector binary tree, to make your
		data visiting and management more efficient. if your data has
		very structurized column names with specific connecting
		pattern, it can read, split, and factorize these names, then
		build the mapping from all string objects to an array or
		tensor, through vector binary tree, by which the batched data
		processing can be implemented easily. The methods of array and
		tensor are also applicable.
