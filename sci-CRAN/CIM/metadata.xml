		Compositional Impact of Migration // Produces statistical
		indicators of the impact of migration on the socio-demographic
		composition of an area. Three measures can be used: ratios,
		percentages and the Duncan index of dissimilarity. The input
		data files are assumed to be in an  origin-destination matrix
		format, with each cell representing a flow count between an
		origin and a destination area. Columns are expected to
		represent origins, and rows are expected to represent
		destinations. The first row and column are assumed to contain
		labels for each area. See Rodriguez-Vignoli and Rowe (2018)
