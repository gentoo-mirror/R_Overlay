		Bayesian Analysis of Finite Mixture of Plackett-Luce Models //
		Fit finite mixtures of Plackett-Luce models for partial top
		rankings/orderings within the Bayesian framework. It provides
		MAP point estimates via EM algorithm and posterior MCMC
		simulations via Gibbs Sampling. It also fits MLE as a special
		case of the noninformative Bayesian analysis with vague priors.
		In addition to inferential techniques, the package assists
		other fundamental phases of a model-based analysis for partial
		rankings/orderings, by including functions for data
		manipulation, simulation, descriptive summary, model selection
		and goodness-of-fit evaluation. Main references on the methods
		are Mollica and Tardella (2017) doi:10.1007/s11336-016-9530-0
		and Mollica and Tardella (2014) doi:10.1002/sim.6224.
