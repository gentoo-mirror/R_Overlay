		Multiscale Graph Correlation // Multiscale Graph Correlation
		(MGC) is a framework developed by Shen et al. (2017)
		arXiv:1609.05148 that extends global correlation procedures to
		be multiscale; consequently, MGC tests typically require far
		fewer samples than existing methods for a wide variety of
		dependence structures and dimensionalities, while maintaining
		computational efficiency. Moreover, MGC provides a simple and
		elegant multiscale characterization of the potentially complex
		latent geometry underlying the relationship.
