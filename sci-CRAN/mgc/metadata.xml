		Multiscale Graph Correlation // Multiscale Graph Correlation
		(MGC) is a framework developed by Vogelstein et al. (2019)
		DOI:10.7554/eLife.41690 that extends global correlation
		procedures to be multiscale; consequently, MGC tests typically
		require far fewer samples than existing methods for a wide
		variety of dependence structures and dimensionalities, while
		maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, MGC provides a
		simple and elegant multiscale characterization of the
		potentially complex latent geometry underlying the
		relationship.
