		Simplify Connections to Database Sources // Connecting to
		databases requires boilerplate code to specify connection
		parameters and to set up sessions properly with the DBMS. This
		package provides a simple tool to fill two purposes:
		abstracting connection details, including secret credentials,
		out of your source code and managing configuration for
		frequently-used database connections in a persistent and
		flexible way, while minimizing requirements on the runtime
		environment.
