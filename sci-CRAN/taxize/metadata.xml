		Taxonomic Information from Around the Web // Interacts with a
		suite of web application programming interfaces (API) for
		taxonomic tasks, such as getting database specific taxonomic
		identifiers, verifying species names, getting taxonomic
		hierarchies, fetching downstream and upstream taxonomic names,
		getting taxonomic synonyms, converting scientific to common
		names and vice versa, and more. Some of the services supported
		include 'NCBI E-utilities'
		(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/), 'Encyclopedia
		of Life' (https://eol.org/docs/what-is-eol/data-services),
		'Global Biodiversity Information Facility'
		(https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/openapi/), and many more. Links
		to the API documentation for other supported services are
		available in the documentation for their respective functions
		in this package.
