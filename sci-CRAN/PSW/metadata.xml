		Propensity Score Weighting Methods for Dichotomous Treatments //
		Provides propensity score weighting methods to control for
		confounding in causal inference with dichotomous treatments and
		continuous/binary outcomes. It includes the following
		functional modules: (1) visualization of the propensity score
		distribution in both treatment groups with mirror histogram,
		(2) covariate balance diagnosis, (3) propensity score model
		specification test, (4) weighted estimation of treatment
		effect, and (5) augmented estimation of treatment effect with
		outcome regression. The weighting methods include the inverse
		probability weight (IPW) for estimating the average treatment
		effect (ATE), the IPW for average treatment effect of the
		treated (ATT), the IPW for the average treatment effect of the
		controls (ATC), the matching weight (MW), the overlap weight
		(OVERLAP), and the trapezoidal weight (TRAPEZOIDAL). Sandwich
		variance estimation is provided to adjust for the sampling
		variability of the estimated propensity score. These methods
		are discussed by Hirano et al (2003)
