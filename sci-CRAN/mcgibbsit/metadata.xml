		Warnes and Raftery's 'MCGibbsit' MCMC Run Length and Convergence
		Diagnostic // Implementation of Warnes  Raftery's MCGibbsit
		run-length and convergence diagnostic for a set of (not-
		necessarily independent) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
		samplers.  It combines the quantile estimate error-bounding
		approach of the Raftery and Lewis MCMC run length diagnostic
		`gibbsit` with the between verses within chain approach of the
		Gelman and Rubin MCMC convergence diagnostic.
