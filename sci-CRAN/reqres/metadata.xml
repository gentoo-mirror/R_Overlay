		Powerful Classes for HTTP Requests and Responses // In order to
		facilitate parsing of http requests and creating appropriate
		responses this package provides two classes to handle a lot of
		the housekeeping involved in working with http exchanges. The
		infrastructure builds upon the 'rook' specification and is thus
		well suited to be combined with 'httpuv' based web servers.
