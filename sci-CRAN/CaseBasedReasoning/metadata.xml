		Case Based Reasoning // Case-based reasoning is a problem-solving
		methodology that involves solving a new problem by referring to
		the solution of a similar problem in a large set of previously
		solved problems. The key aspect of Case Based Reasoning is to
		determine the problem that "most closely" matches the new
		problem at hand. This is achieved by defining a family of
		distance functions and using these distance functions as
		parameters for local averaging regression estimates of the
		final result. The optimal distance function is chosen based on
		a specific error measure used in regression estimation. This
		approach allows for efficient problem-solving by leveraging
		past experiences and adapting solutions from similar cases. The
		underlying concept is inspired by the work of Dippon J. (2002)
