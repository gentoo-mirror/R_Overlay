		Fast Algorithm for Penalized Quantile Regression // Implements an
		efficient algorithm for fitting the entire regularization path
		of quantile regression models with elastic-net penalties using
		a generalized coordinate descent scheme. The framework also
		supports SCAD and MCP penalties. It is designed for high-
		dimensional datasets and emphasizes numerical accuracy and
		computational efficiency. This package implements the
		algorithms proposed in Tang, Q., Zhang, Y.,  Wang, B. (2022)
