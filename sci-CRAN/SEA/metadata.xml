		Segregation Analysis // A few major genes and a series of
		polygene are responsive for each quantitative trait. Major
		genes are individually identified while polygene is
		collectively detected. This is mixed major genes plus polygene
		inheritance analysis or segregation analysis (SEA). In the SEA,
		phenotypes from a single or multiple bi-parental segregation
		populations along with their parents are used to fit all the
		possible models and the best model of the trait for population
		phenotypic distributions is viewed as the model of the trait.
		There are fourteen types of population combinations available.
