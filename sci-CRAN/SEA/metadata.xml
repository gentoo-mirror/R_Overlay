		Segregation Analysis // A few major genes and a series of
		polygene are responsive for each quantitative trait. Major
		genes are individually identified while polygene is
		collectively detected. This is mixed major genes plus polygene
		inheritance analysis or segregation analysis (SEA). In the SEA,
		phenotypes from a single or multiple segregation populations
		along with their parents are used to fit all the possible
		models and the best model is viewed as the model of the trait.
		There are fourteen combinations of populations available. Zhang
