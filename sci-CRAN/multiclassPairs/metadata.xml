		Build MultiClass Pair-Based Classifiers using TSPs or RF // A
		toolbox to train a single sample classifier that uses in-sample
		feature relationships. The relationships are represented as
		feature1  feature2 (e.g. gene1  gene2). We provide two options
		to go with. First is based on 'switchBox' package which uses
		Top-score pairs algorithm. Second is a novel implementation
		based on random forest algorithm. For simple problems we
		recommend to use one-vs-rest using TSP option due to its
		simplicity and for being easy to interpret.  For complex
		problems RF performs better.  Both lines filter the features
		first then combine the filtered features to make the list of
		all the possible rules (i.e. rule1: feature1  feature2, rule2:
		feature1  feature3, etc...).  Then the list of rules will be
		filtered and the most important and informative rules will be
		kept. The informative rules will be assembled in an one-vs-rest
		model or in an RF model.  We provide a detailed description
		with each function in this package to explain the filtration
		and training methodology in each line.
