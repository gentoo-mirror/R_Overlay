		Simultaneous CIs for Ratios of Means of Log-Normal Populations
		with Zeros // Construct the simultaneous confidence intervals
		for ratios of means of Log-normal populations with zeros. It
		also has a Python module that do the same thing, and can be
		applied to multiple comparisons of parameters of any k mixture
		distributions. And we provide four methods, the method based on
		generalized pivotal quantity with order statistics and the
		quantity based on Wilson by Li et al. (2009)
		doi:10.1016/j.spl.2009.03.004 (GPQW), and the methods based on
		generalized pivotal quantity with order statistics and the
		quantity based on Hannig (2009) doi:10.1093/biomet/asp050
		(GPQH). The other two methods are based on two-step MOVER
		intervals by Amany H, Abdel K (2015)
		doi:10.1080/03610918.2013.767911. We deduce Fiducial
		generalized pivotal two-step MOVER intervals based on Wilson
		quantity (FMW) and based on Hannig's quantity (FMWH). All these
		approach you can find in the paper of us which it has been
		submitted.
