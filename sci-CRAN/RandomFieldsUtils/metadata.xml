		Utilities for the Simulation and Analysis of Random Fields and
		Genomic Data // Various utilities are provided that might be
		used in spatial statistics and elsewhere. It delivers a method
		for solving linear equations that checks the sparsity of the
		matrix before any algorithm is used. In particular the
		following algorithms are implemented: the pivoted Cholesky
		decomposition doi:10.1016/j.apnum.2011.10.001 and on graphic
		cards, the Struve functions
		doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-1993-1176713-8, and a precise algorithm
		for evaluating the special covariance function.
