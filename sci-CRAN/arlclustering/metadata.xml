		Exploring Social Network Structures Through Friendship-Driven
		Community Detection with Association Rules Mining // Implements
		an innovative approach to community detection in social
		networks using Association Rules Learning. The package provides
		tools for processing graph and rules objects, generating
		association rules, and detecting communities based on node
		interactions. Designed to facilitate advanced research in
		Social Network Analysis, this package leverages association
		rules learning for enhanced community detection. This approach
		is described in El-Moussaoui et al. (2021)
