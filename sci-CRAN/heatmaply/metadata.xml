		Interactive Cluster Heat Maps Using 'plotly' // Create
		interactive cluster 'heatmaps' that can be saved as a stand-
		alone HTML file, embedded in 'R Markdown' documents or in a
		'Shiny' apps, and available in the 'RStudio' viewer pane, .
		Hover the mouse pointer over a cell to show details or drag a
		rectangle to zoom. A 'heatmap' is a popular graphical method
		for visualizing high-dimensional data, in which a table of
		numbers are encoded as a grid of colored cells. The rows and
		columns of the matrix are ordered to highlight patterns and are
		often accompanied by 'dendrograms'. 'Heatmaps' are used in many
		fields for visualizing observations, correlations, missing
		values patterns, and more. Interactive 'heatmaps' allow the
		inspection of specific value by hovering the mouse over a cell,
		as well as zooming into a region of the 'heatmap' by dragging a
		rectangle around the relevant area. This work is based on the
		'ggplot2' and 'plotly.js' engine. It produces similar
		'heatmaps' as 'heatmap.2' or 'd3heatmap', with the advantage of
		speed ('plotly.js' is able to handle larger size matrix), the
		ability to zoom from the 'dendrogram' panes, and the placing of
		factor variables in the sides of the 'heatmap'.
