		Matrix eQTL: Ultra Fast eQTL Analysis via Large Matrix Operations
		// Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large
		datasets. Matrix eQTL can test for association between genotype
		and gene expression using linear regression with either
		additive or ANOVA genotype effects. The models can include
		covariates to account for factors as population stratification,
		gender, and clinical variables. It also supports models with
		heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors, false discovery rate
		estimation and separate treatment of local (cis) and distant
		(trans) eQTLs. For more details see Shabalin (2012)
