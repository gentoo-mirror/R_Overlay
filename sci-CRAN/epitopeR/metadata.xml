		Predict Peptide-MHC Binding // A suite of tools to predict
		peptide MHC (major histocompatibility complex) presentation in
		the context of both human and mouse. Polymorphic peptides
		between self and foreign proteins are identified. The ability
		of peptides to bind self MHC is assessed and scored. Based on
		half maximal inhibitory concentration as queried through the
		immune epitope database API http://tools.iedb.org using user
		defined methods, the foreign peptides most likely to be
		presented are output along with their predicted binding
		strength, amino acid position, the protein from which each
		peptide was derived, and the presenting allele. "References:"
