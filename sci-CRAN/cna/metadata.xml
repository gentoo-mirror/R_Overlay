		Causal Modeling with Coincidence Analysis // Provides
		comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with
		Coincidence Analysis (CNA), which is a configurational
		comparative method of causal data analysis that was first
		introduced in Baumgartner (2009) doi:10.1177/0049124109339369,
		and generalized in Baumgartner  Ambuehl (2018)
		doi:10.1017/psrm.2018.45. CNA is related to Qualitative
		Comparative Analysis (QCA), but contrary to the latter, it is
		custom-built for uncovering causal structures with multiple
		outcomes and it builds causal models from the bottom up by
		gradually combining single factors to complex dependency
		structures until the requested thresholds of model fit are met.
		The new functionalities provided by this package version
		include functions for evaluating and benchmarking the
		correctness of CNA's output, a function determining whether a
		solution is an INUS model, a function bringing non-INUS
		expressions into INUS form, and a function for identifying
		cyclic models. The package vignette has been updated
		accordingly.
