		Causal Modeling with Coincidence Analysis // Provides
		comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with
		Coincidence Analysis (CNA), which is a configurational
		comparative method of causal data analysis that was first
		introduced in Baumgartner (2009) doi:10.1177/0049124109339369,
		and generalized in Baumgartner  Ambuehl (2018)
		doi:10.1017/psrm.2018.45. CNA is designed to recover INUS-
		causation from data, which is particularly relevant for
		analyzing processes featuring conjunctural causation (component
		causation) and equifinality (alternative causation). CNA is
		currently the only method for INUS-discovery that allows for
		multiple effects (outcomes/endogenous factors), meaning it can
		analyze common-cause and causal chain structures.
