		Causal Modeling with Coincidence Analysis // Provides
		comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with
		Coincidence Analysis (CNA), which is a configurational
		comparative method of causal data analysis that was first
		introduced in Baumgartner (2009) doi:10.1177/0049124109339369.
		CNA is related to Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), but
		contrary to the latter, it is custom-built for uncovering
		causal structures with multiple outcomes and it builds causal
		models from the bottom up by gradually combining single factors
		to complex dependency structures until the requested thresholds
		of model fit are met. The new functionalities provided by this
		package version include various new parameters of model fit, as
		exhaustiveness and faithfulness, and a test for structural
		redundancies in multi-outcome models with a corresponding
		function that eliminates such redundancies. Also, the
		algorithmic efficiency has been significantly increased.
		Finally, the package now comes with an extensive vignette.
