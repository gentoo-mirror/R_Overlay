		Causal Modeling with Coincidence Analysis // Provides
		comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with
		Coincidence Analysis (CNA), which is a configurational
		comparative method of causal data analysis that was first
		introduced in Baumgartner (2009) doi:10.1177/0049124109339369.
		CNA is related to Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), but
		contrary to the latter, it is custom-built for uncovering
		causal structures with multiple outcomes. While previous
		versions have only been capable of processing dichotomous
		variables, the current version generalizes CNA for multi-value
		and continuous variables whose values are interpreted as
		membership scores in fuzzy sets.
