		Decentralized Unequivocality in Psychological Science // The
		constructs used to study the human psychology have many
		definitions and corresponding instructions for eliciting and
		coding qualitative data pertaining to constructs' content and
		for measuring the constructs. This plethora of definitions and
		instructions necessitates unequivocal reference to specific
		definitions and instructions in empirical and secondary
		research. This package implements a human- and machine-readable
		standard for specifying construct definitions and instructions
		for measurement and qualitative research based on 'YAML'. This
		standard facilitates systematic unequivocal reference to
		specific construct definitions and corresponding instructions
		in a decentralized manner (i.e. without requiring central
		curation; Peters (2020) doi:10.31234/osf.io/xebhn).
