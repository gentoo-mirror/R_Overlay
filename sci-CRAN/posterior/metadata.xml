		Tools for Working with Posterior Distributions // Provides useful
		tools for both users and developers of packages for fitting
		Bayesian models or working with output from Bayesian models.
		The primary goals of the package are to: (a) Efficiently
		convert between many different useful formats of draws
		(samples) from posterior or prior distributions. (b) Provide
		consistent methods for operations commonly performed on draws,
		for example, subsetting, binding, or mutating draws. (c)
		Provide various summaries of draws in convenient formats. (d)
		Provide lightweight implementations of state of the art
		posterior inference diagnostics. References: Vehtari et al.
