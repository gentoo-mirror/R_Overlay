		Hierarchical Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey Scaling via 'Stan' //
		Perform hierarchical Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey scaling using
		Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via 'Stan'. Aldrich-McKelvey ('AM')
		scaling is a method for estimating the ideological positions of
		survey respondents and political actors on a common scale using
		positional survey data. The hierarchical versions of the
		Bayesian 'AM' model included in this package outperform other
		versions by a considerable margin both in terms of yielding
		meaningful posterior distributions for respondent positions and
		in terms of recovering true respondent positions in
		simulations. The package contains functions for preparing data,
		fitting models, extracting estimates, plotting key results, and
		comparing models using cross-validation. The models in this
		package are described in: Blstad (forthcoming) ''Hierarchical
		Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey Scaling'', Political Analysis.
