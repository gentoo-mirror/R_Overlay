		Copula-Based Estimator for Long-Range Dependent Processes under
		Missing Data // Implements the copula-based estimator for
		univariate long-range dependent processes, introduced in Pumi
		et al. (2023) doi:10.1007/s00362-023-01418-z. Notably, this
		estimator is capable of handling missing data and has been
		shown to perform exceptionally well, even when up to 70% of
		data is missing (as reported in arXiv:2303.04754) and has been
		found to outperform several other commonly applied estimators.
