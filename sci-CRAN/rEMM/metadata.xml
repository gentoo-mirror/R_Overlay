		Extensible Markov Model for Modelling Temporal Relationships
		Between Clusters // Implements TRACDS (Temporal Relationships
		between Clusters for Data Streams), a generalization of
		Extensible Markov Model (EMM). TRACDS adds a temporal or order
		model to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically
		adapting Markov Chain. Also provides an implementation of EMM
		(TRACDS on top of tNN data stream clustering). Development of
		this package was supported in part by NSF IIS-0948893 and
		R21HG005912 from the National Human Genome Research Institute.
