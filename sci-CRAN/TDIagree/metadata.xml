		Assessment of Agreement using the Total Deviation Index // The
		total deviation index (TDI) is an unscaled statistical measure
		used to evaluate the deviation between paired quantitative
		measurements when assessing the extent of agreement between
		different raters. It describes a boundary such that a large
		specified proportion of the differences in paired measurements
		are within the boundary (Lin, 2000)
		https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10641028/. This R package
		implements some methodologies existing in the literature for
		TDI estimation and inference in the case of two raters.
