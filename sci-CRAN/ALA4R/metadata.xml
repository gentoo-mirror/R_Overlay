		Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) Data and Resources in R // The
		Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) provides tools to enable users
		of biodiversity information to find, access, combine and
		visualise data on Australian plants and animals; these have
		been made available from https://ala.org.au/. ALA4R provides a
		subset of the tools to be directly used within R. It enables
		the R community to directly access data and resources hosted by
		the ALA. ALA4R is deprecated and will be removed from CRAN at
		the end of 2021. The package to replace ALA4R, 'galah', is now
		available on CRAN https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=galah. For
		an introduction to 'galah', visit the GitHub page
		https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah.
