		Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) Data and Resources in R // The
		Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) provides tools to enable users
		of biodiversity information to find, access, combine and
		visualise data on Australian plants and animals; these have
		been made available from http://ala.org.au/. ALA4R provides a
		subset of the tools to be directly used within R. It enables
		the R community to directly access data and resources hosted by
		the ALA. Our goal is to enable outputs (e.g. observations of
		species) to be queried and output in a range of standard
		formats.
