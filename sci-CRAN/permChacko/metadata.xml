		Chacko Test for Order-Restriction with Permutation // Implements
		an extension of the Chacko chi-square test for ordered vectors
		(Chacko, 1966, https://www.jstor.org/stable/25051572). Our
		extension brings the Chacko test to the computer age by
		implementing a permutation test to offer a numeric estimate of
		the p-value, which is particularly useful when the analytic
		solution is not available.
