		Computation and Decomposition of the Mutual Information Index //
		The Mutual Information Index (M) introduced to social science
		literature by Theil and Finizza (1971)
		doi:10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989795 is a multigroup segregation
		measure that is highly decomposable and that according to
		Frankel and Volij (2011) doi:10.1016/j.jet.2010.10.008 and Mora
		and Ruiz-Castillo (2011) doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2011.01237.x
		satisfies the Strong Unit Decomposability and Strong Group
		Decomposability properties. This package allows computing and
		decomposing the total index value into its "between" and
		"within" terms. These last terms can also be decomposed into
		their contributions, either by group or unit characteristics.
		The factors that produce each "within" term can also be
		displayed at the user's request. The results can be computed
		considering a variable or sets of variables that define
		separate clusters.
