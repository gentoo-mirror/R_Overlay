		Test for Conditional Independence Based on the Generalized
		Covariance Measure (GCM) // A statistical hypothesis test for
		conditional independence. It performs nonlinear regressions on
		the conditioning variable and then tests for a vanishing
		covariance between the resulting residuals. It can be applied
		to both univariate random variables and multivariate random
		vectors. Details of the method can be found in Rajen D. Shah
		and Jonas Peters: The Hardness of Conditional Independence
		Testing and the Generalised Covariance Measure, Annals of
		Statistics 48(3), 1514--1538, 2020.
