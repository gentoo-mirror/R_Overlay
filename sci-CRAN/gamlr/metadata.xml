		Gamma Lasso Regression // The gamma lasso algorithm provides
		regularization paths corresponding to a range of non-convex
		cost functions between L0 and L1 norms.  As much as possible,
		usage for this package is analogous to that for the glmnet
		package (which does the same thing for penalization between L1
		and L2 norms).  For details see: Taddy (2017 JCGS), 'One-Step
		Estimator Paths for Concave Regularization', arXiv:1308.5623.
