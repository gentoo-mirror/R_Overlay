		Text Alignment with Smith-Waterman // Find similarities between
		texts using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The algorithm
		performs local sequence alignment and determines similar
		regions between two strings. The Smith-Waterman algorithm is
		explained in the paper: "Identification of common molecular
		subsequences" by T.F.Smith and M.S.Waterman (1981), available
		at doi:10.1016/0022-2836(81)90087-5. This package implements
		the same logic for sequences of words and letters instead of
		molecular sequences.
