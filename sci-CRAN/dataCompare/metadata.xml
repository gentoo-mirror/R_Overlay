		A 'shiny' App to Compare Two Data Frames // A tool developed with
		the 'Golem' framework which provides an easier way to check
		cells differences between two data frames. The user provides
		two data frames for comparison, selects IDs variables
		identifying each row of input data, then clicks a button to
		perform the comparison. Several 'R' package functions are used
		to describe the data and perform the comparison in the server
		of the application. The main ones are comparedf() from
		'arsenal' and skim() from 'skimr'. For more details see the
		description of comparedf() from the 'arsenal' package and that
		of skim() from the 'skimr' package.
