		Permutation True Discovery Guarantee by Sum-Based Tests // It
		allows to quickly perform permutation-based closed testing by
		sum-based global tests, and construct lower confidence bounds
		for the TDP, simultaneously over all subsets of hypotheses. As
		a main feature, it produces simultaneous lower confidence
		bounds for the proportion of active voxels in different
		clusters for fMRI cluster analysis. Details may be found in
		Vesely, Finos, and Goeman (2020) arXiv:2102.11759.
