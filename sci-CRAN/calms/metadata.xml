		Comprehensive Analysis of Latent Means // Provides a Shiny
		application to conduct comprehensive analysis of latent means
		including the examination of group equivalency, propensity
		score analysis, measurement invariance analysis, and assessment
		of latent mean differences of equivalent groups with invariant
		data. Group equivalency and propensity score analyses are
		implemented using the 'MatchIt' package [Ho et al. (2011)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v042.i08], ensuring robust control for
		covariates. Structural equation modeling and invariance testing
		rely heavily on the 'lavaan' package [Rosseel (2012)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v048.i02], providing a flexible and powerful
		modeling framework. The application also integrates modified
		functions from Hammack-Brown et al. (2021)
		doi:10.1002/hrdq.21452 to support factor ratio testing and the
		list-and-delete procedure.
