		Calculation for Single Arm Group Sequential Test with Binary
		Endpoint // Consider an at-most-K-stage group sequential design
		with only an upper bound for the last analysis and non-binding
		lower bounds.With binary endpoint, two kinds of test can be
		applied, asymptotic test based on normal distribution and exact
		test based on binomial distribution. This package supports the
		computation of boundaries and conditional power for single-arm
		group sequential test with binary endpoint, via either
		asymptotic or exact test. The package also provides functions
		to obtain boundary crossing probabilities given the design.
