		Tree Taper Curves and Sorting Based on 'TapeR' // Providing new
		german-wide 'TapeR' Models and functions for their evaluation.
		Included are the most common tree species in Germany (Norway
		spruce, Scots pine, European larch, Douglas fir, Silver fir as
		well as European beech, Common/Sessile oak and Red oak). Many
		other species are mapped to them so that 36 tree species /
		groups can be processed. Single trees are defined by species
		code, one or multiple diameters in arbitrary measuring height
		and tree height. The functions then provide information on
		diameters along the stem, bark thickness, height of diameters,
		volume of the total or parts of the trunk and total and
		component above-ground biomass. It is also possible to
		calculate assortments from the taper curves. For diameter and
		volume estimation, uncertainty information is given.
