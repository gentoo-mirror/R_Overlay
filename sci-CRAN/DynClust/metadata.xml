		Denoising and Clustering for Dynamical Image Sequence (2D or
		3D)+t // A two-stage procedure for the denoising and clustering
		of stack of noisy images acquired over time. Clustering only
		assumes that the data contain an unknown but small number of
		dynamic features. The method first denoises the signals using
		local spatial and full temporal information. The clustering
		step uses the previous output to aggregate voxels based on the
		knowledge of their spatial neighborhood. Both steps use a
		single keytool based on the statistical comparison of the
		difference of two signals with the null signal. No assumption
		is therefore required on the shape of the signals. The data are
		assumed to be normally distributed (or at least follow a
		symmetric distribution) with a known constant variance. Working
		pixelwise, the method can be time-consuming depending on the
		size of the data-array but harnesses the power of multicore
		cpus.
