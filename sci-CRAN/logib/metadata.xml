		Salary Analysis by the Swiss Federal Office for Gender Equality
		// Implementation of the Swiss Confederation's standard
		analysis model for salary analyses
		https://www.ebg.admin.ch/en/equal-pay-analysis-with-logib in R.
		The analysis is run at company-level and the model is intended
		for medium-sized and large companies. It can technically be
		used with 50 or more employees (apprentices, trainees/interns
		and expats are not included in the analysis). Employees with at
		least 100 employees are required by the Gender Equality Act to
		conduct an equal pay analysis. This package allows users to run
		the equal salary analysis in R, providing additional
		transparency with respect to the methodology and simple
		automation possibilities.
