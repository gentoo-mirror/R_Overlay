		Extrapolation and Bridging of Adult Information in Early Phase
		Dose-Finding Paediatrics Studies // A unified method for
		designing and analysing dose-finding trials in paediatrics,
		while bridging information from adults, is proposed in the
		dfped package. The dose range can be calculated under three
		extrapolation methods: linear, allometry and maturation
		adjustment, using pharmacokinetic (PK) data. To do this, it is
		assumed that target exposures are the same in both populations.
		The working model and prior distribution parameters of the
		dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy relationships can be obtained
		using early phase adult toxicity and efficacy data at several
		dose levels through dfped package. Priors are used into the
		dose finding process through a Bayesian model selection or
		adaptive priors, to facilitate adjusting the amount of prior
		information to differences between adults and children. This
		calibrates the model to adjust for misspecification if the
		adult and paediatric data are very different. User can use
		his/her own Bayesian model written in Stan code through the
		dfped package. A template of this model is proposed in the
		examples of the corresponding R functions in the package.
		Finally, in this package you can find a simulation function for
		one trial or for more than one trial.
