		qPCR Data Analysis // Various methods are employed for
		statistical analysis and graphical presentation of real-time
		PCR (quantitative PCR  or qPCR) data. 'rtpcr' handles
		amplification efficiency calculation and statistical analysis
		of real-time PCR data based on one reference gene. By
		accounting for amplification efficiency values, 'rtpcr' was
		developed using a general calculation method described by
		Ganger et al. (2017) doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1949-5, covering
		both the Livak and Pfaffl methods. Based on the experimental
		conditions, the functions of the 'rtpcr' package use t-test
		(for experiments with a two-level factor) or analysis of
		variance (for cases where more than two levels or factors
		exist) to calculate the fold change or relative expression. The
		functions also provide standard deviations and confidence
		limits for means, apply statistical mean comparisons, and
		present letter mean grouping. To facilitate using 'rtpcr',
		different datasets have been employed in the examples and the
		outputs are explained. An outstanding feature of 'rtpcr'
		package is providing publication-ready bar plots with various
		controlling arguments for experiments with up to three
		different factors. The 'rtpcr' package is user-friendly and
		easy to work with and provides an applicable resource for
		analyzing real-time PCR data.
