		qPCR Data Analysis // Various methods are employed for
		statistical analysis and graphical presentation of real-time
		PCR (quantitative PCR  or qPCR) data. 'rtpcr' handles
		amplification efficiency calculation, statistical analysis and
		graphical representation of real-time PCR data based on up to
		two reference genes. By accounting for amplification efficiency
		values, 'rtpcr' was developed using a general calculation
		method described by Ganger et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1949-5 and Taylor et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1016/j.tibtech.2018.12.002, covering both the Livak and
		Pfaffl methods. Based on the experimental conditions, the
		functions of the 'rtpcr' package use t-test (for experiments
		with a two-level factor), analysis of variance (ANOVA),
		analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or analysis of repeated measure
		data to calculate the fold change (FC, Delta Delta Ct method)
		or relative expression (RE, Delta Ct method). The functions
		further provide standard errors and confidence intervals for
		means, apply statistical mean comparisons and present
		significance. To facilitate function application, different
		data sets were used as examples and the outputs were explained.
		rtpcr package also provides bar plots using various controlling
		arguments. The 'rtpcr' package is user-friendly and easy to
		work with and provides an applicable resource for analyzing
		real-time PCR data.
