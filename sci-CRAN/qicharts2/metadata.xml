		Quality Improvement Charts // Functions for making run charts,
		Shewhart control charts and Pareto charts for continuous
		quality improvement. Included control charts are: I, MR, Xbar,
		S, T, C, U, U', P, P', and G charts. Non-random variation in
		the form of minor to moderate persistent shifts in data over
		time is identified by the Anhoej rules for unusually long runs
		and unusually few crossing [Anhoej, Olesen (2014)
		doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113825]. Non-random variation in the
		form of larger, possibly transient, shifts is identified by
		Shewhart's 3-sigma rule [Mohammed, Worthington, Woodall (2008)
		doi:10.1136/qshc.2004.012047].
