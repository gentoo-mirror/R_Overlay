		Find Clinical Trial Sites Under-Reporting Adverse Events //
		Monitoring of Adverse Event (AE) reporting in clinical trials
		is important for patient safety. Sites that are under-reporting
		AEs can be detected using Bootstrap-based simulations that
		simulate overall AE reporting. Based on the simulation an AE
		under-reporting probability is assigned to each site in a given
		trial (Koneswarakantha 2021 doi:10.1007/s40264-020-01011-5).
