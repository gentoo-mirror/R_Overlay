		Simulate Expression Data from 'igraph' Networks // Functions to
		develop simulated continuous data (e.g., gene expression) from
		a sigma covariance matrix derived from a graph structure in
		'igraph' objects. Intended to extend 'mvtnorm' to take 'igraph'
		structures rather than sigma matrices as input.
