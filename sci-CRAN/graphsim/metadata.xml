		Simulate Expression Data from 'igraph' Networks // Functions to
		develop simulated continuous data (e.g., gene expression) from
		a sigma covariance matrix derived from a graph structure in
		'igraph' objects. Intended to extend 'mvtnorm' to take 'igraph'
		structures rather than sigma matrices as input. This allows the
		use of simulated data that correctly accounts for pathway
		relationships and correlations. This allows the use of
		simulated data that correctly accounts for pathway
		relationships and correlations. Here we present a versatile
		statistical framework to simulate  correlated gene expression
		data from biological pathways, by sampling from a multivariate
		normal distribution derived from a graph structure. This
		package allows the simulation of biological pathways from a
		graph structure based on a statistical model of gene
		expression. For example methods to infer biological pathways
		and gene regulatory networks from gene expression data can be
		tested on simulated datasets using this framework. This also
		allows for pathway structures to be considered as a confounding
		variable when simulating gene expression data to test the
		performance of genomic analyses.
