		Overdispersion in Count Data Multiple Regression Analysis //
		Detection of overdispersion in count data for multiple
		regression analysis. Log-linear count data regression is one of
		the most popular techniques for predictive modeling where there
		is a non-negative discrete quantitative dependent variable. In
		order to ensure the inferences from the use of count data
		models are appropriate, researchers may choose between the
		estimation of a Poisson model and a negative binomial model,
		and the correct decision for prediction from a count data
		estimation is directly linked to the existence of
		overdispersion of the dependent variable, conditional to the
		explanatory variables. Based on the studies of Cameron and
		Trivedi (1990) doi:10.1016/0304-4076(90)90014-K and Cameron and
		Trivedi (2013, ISBN:978-1107667273), the overdisp() command is
		a contribution to researchers, providing a fast and secure
		solution for the detection of overdispersion in count data.
		Another advantage is that the installation of other packages is
		unnecessary, since the command runs in the basic R language.
