		Common Use Tools for Genomic Analysis // Built by Hodges lab
		members for current and future Hodges lab members. Other
		individuals are welcome to use as well. Provides useful
		functions that the lab uses everyday to analyze various genomic
		datasets. Critically, only general use functions are provided;
		functions specific to a given technique are reserved for a
		separate package. As the lab grows, we expect to continue
		adding functions to the package to build on previous lab
		members code.
