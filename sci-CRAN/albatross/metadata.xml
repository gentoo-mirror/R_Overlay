		PARAFAC Analysis of Fluorescence Excitation-Emission Matrices //
		Perform parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC: Hitchcock, 1927)
		doi:10.1002/sapm192761164 on fluorescence excitation-emission
		matrices: handle scattering signal and inner filter effect,
		scale the dataset, fit the model; perform split-half validation
		or jack-knifing. Modified approaches such as Whittaker
		interpolation, randomised split-half, and fluorescence and
		scattering model estimation are also available. The package has
		a low dependency footprint and has been tested on a wide range
		of R versions.
