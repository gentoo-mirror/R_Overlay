		PARAFAC Analysis of Fluorescence Excitation-Emission Matrices //
		Perform parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC: Hitchcock, 1927)
		doi:10.1002/sapm192761164 on fluorescence excitation-emission
		matrices (FEEMs): handle scattering signal and inner filter
		effect, scale the dataset, fit the model; perform split-half
		validation or jack-knifing. A modified approach called
		"randomised split-half" is also available. The package has a
		low dependency footprint (only two direct dependencies not in
		core or recommended; four total non-core/recommended
		dependencies) and has been tested on a wide range of R versions
		(including R as old as 3.3.3 from Debian Stretch).
