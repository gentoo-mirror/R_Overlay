		Bindings to AppArmor and Security Related Linux Tools // Bindings
		to various methods in the kernel for enforcing security
		restrictions. AppArmor can apply mandatory access control (MAC)
		policies on a given task (process) via security profiles with
		detailed ACL definitions. In addition the package has kernel
		bindings for setting the process hardware resource limits
		(rlimit), uid, gid, affinity and priority. The high level R
		function 'eval.secure' builds on these methods to do dynamic
		sandboxing: it evaluates a single R expression within a
		temporary fork which acts as a sandbox by enforcing fine
		grained restrictions without affecting the main R process.
		Recent versions on this package can also be installed on
		systems without libapparmor, in which case some features are
		automatically disabled.
