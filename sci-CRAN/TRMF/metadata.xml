		Temporally Regularized Matrix Factorization // Functions to
		estimate temporally regularized matrix factorizations (TRMF)
		for forecasting and imputing values in short but high-
		dimensional time series. Uses regularized alternating least
		squares to compute the factorization, allows for several types
		of constraints on matrix factors and natively handles weighted
		and missing data.
