		Temporally Regularized Matrix Factorization // Functions to
		estimate temporally regularized matrix factorization (TRMF) for
		forecasting and imputing values in short but high-dimensional
		time series. Uses regularized alternating least squares to
		compute the factorization, allows for several types of
		constraints on matrix factors and can handle weighted data.
