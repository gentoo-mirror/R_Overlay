		A Supplementary Function Set to 'MatchIt' // This function set is
		supplementary to 'MatchIt'. Its functions conduct several
		computations that 'MatchIt' does not provide. It takes the
		'MatchIt' result object and/or the original data to compute
		standardized mean differences (SMD) between groups before and
		after matching. It also calculates ratio of variances and ratio
		of residual variances. In addition, it draws SMD comparison
		plots and QQ plots of distance measure score to help diagnose
		the matching result.
