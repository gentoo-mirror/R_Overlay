		Fast and Scalable Learning of Sparse Changes in High-Dimensional
		Gaussian Graphical Model Structure // This is an R
		implementation of Fast and Scalable Learning of Sparse Changes
		in High-Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Model Structure
		(DIFFEE). The DIFFEE algorithm can be used to fast estimate the
		differential network between two related datasets. For
		instance, it can identify differential gene network from
		datasets of case and control. By performing data-driven network
		inference from two high-dimensional data sets, this tool can
		help users effectively translate two aggregated data blocks
		into knowledge of the changes among entities between two
		Gaussian Graphical Model. Please run demo(diffeeDemo) to learn
		the basic functions provided by this package. For further
		details, please read the original paper: Beilun Wang, Arshdeep
		Sekhon, Yanjun Qi (2018) arXiv:1710.11223.
