		Dose Response Models for Bayesian Model Averaging // Fits
		(longitudinal) dose-response models utilizing a Bayesian model
		averaging approach as outlined in Gould (2019)
		doi:10.1002/bimj.201700211 for both continuous and binary
		responses.  Functions for plotting and calculating various
		posterior quantities (e.g. posterior mean, quantiles,
		probability of minimum efficacious dose, etc.) are also
		implemented.  Copyright Eli Lilly and Company (2019).
