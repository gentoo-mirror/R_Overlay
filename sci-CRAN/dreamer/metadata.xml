		Dose Response Models for Bayesian Model Averaging // Fits dose-
		response models utilizing a Bayesian model averaging approach
		as outlined in Gould (2019) doi:10.1002/bimj.201700211 for both
		continuous and binary responses. Longitudinal dose-response
		modeling is also supported in a Bayesian model averaging
		framework as outlined in Payne, Ray, and Thomann (2024)
		doi:10.1080/10543406.2023.2292214. Functions for plotting and
		calculating various posterior quantities (e.g. posterior mean,
		quantiles, probability of minimum efficacious dose, etc.) are
		also implemented.  Copyright Eli Lilly and Company (2019).
