		Generalized Additive Mixed Model Interface // An interface for
		fitting generalized additive models (GAMs) and generalized
		additive mixed models (GAMMs) using the 'lme4' package as the
		computational engine, as described in Helwig (2024)
		doi:10.3390/stats7010003. Supports default and formula methods
		for model specification, additive and tensor product splines
		for capturing nonlinear effects, and automatic determination of
		spline type based on the class of each predictor. Includes an
		S3 plot method for visualizing the (nonlinear) model terms, an
		S3 predict method for forming predictions from a fit model, and
		an S3 summary method for conducting significance testing using
		the Bayesian interpretation of a smoothing spline.
