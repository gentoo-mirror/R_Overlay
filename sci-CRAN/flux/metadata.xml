		Flux Rate Calculation from Dynamic Closed Chamber Measurements //
		Functions for the calculation of greenhouse gas flux rates from
		closed chamber concentration measurements. The package follows
		a modular concept: Fluxes can be calculated in just two simple
		steps or in several steps if more control in details is wanted.
		Additionally plot and preparation functions as well as
		functions for modelling gpp and reco are provided.
