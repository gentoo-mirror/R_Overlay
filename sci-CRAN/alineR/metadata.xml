		Alignment of Phonetic Sequences Using the 'ALINE' Algorithm //
		Functions are provided to calculate the 'ALINE' Distance
		between words as per (Kondrak 2000) and (Downey, Hallmark, Cox,
		Norquest,  Lansing, 2008, doi:10.1080/09296170802326681). The
		score is based on phonetic features represented using the
		Unicode-compliant International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
		Parameterized features weights are used to determine the
		optimal alignment and functions are provided to estimate
		optimum values using a genetic algorithm and supervised
		learning. See (Downey, Sun, and Norquest 2017, https://journal.
		r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-005/index.html.
