		MLE for Normally Distributed Data Censored by Limit of Detection
		// Values below the limit of detection (LOD) are a problem in
		several fields of science, and there are numerous approaches
		for replacing the missing data. We present a new mathematical
		solution for maximum likelihood estimation that allows us to
		estimate the true values of the mean and standard deviation for
		normal distributions and is significantly faster than previous
		implementations. The article with the details was submitted to
		JSS and can be currently seen on https://www2.arnes.si/~tverbo/
		LOD/Verbovsek_Sega_2_Manuscript.pdf.
