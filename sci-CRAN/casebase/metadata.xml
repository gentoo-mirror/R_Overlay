		Fitting Flexible Smooth-in-Time Hazards and Risk Functions via
		Logistic and Multinomial Regression // Fit flexible and fully
		parametric hazard regression models to survival data with
		single event type or multiple competing causes via logistic and
		multinomial regression. Our formulation allows for arbitrary
		functional forms of time and its interactions with other
		predictors for time-dependent hazards and hazard ratios. From
		the fitted hazard model, we provide functions to readily
		calculate and plot cumulative incidence and survival curves for
		a given covariate profile. This approach accommodates any log-
		linear hazard function of prognostic time, treatment, and
		covariates, and readily allows for non-proportionality. We also
		provide a plot method for visualizing incidence density via
		population time plots. Based on the case-base sampling approach
		of Hanley and Miettinen (2009) DOI:10.2202/1557-4679.1125,
		Saarela and Arjas (2015) DOI:10.1111/sjos.12125, and Saarela
		(2015) DOI:10.1007/s10985-015-9352-x.
