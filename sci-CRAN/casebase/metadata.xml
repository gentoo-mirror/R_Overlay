		Fitting Flexible Smooth-in-Time Hazards and Risk Functions via
		Logistic and Multinomial Regression // Implements the case-base

		DOI:10.1007/s10985-015-9352-x, for fitting flexible hazard
		regression models to survival data with single event type or
		multiple competing causes via logistic and multinomial
		regression. From the fitted hazard function, cumulative
		incidence, risk functions of time, treatment and profile can be
		derived. This approach accommodates any log-linear hazard
		function of prognostic time, treatment, and covariates, and
		readily allows for non-proportionality. We also provide a plot
		method for visualizing incidence density via population time
		plots.
