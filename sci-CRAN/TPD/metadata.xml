		Methods for Measuring Functional Diversity Based on Trait
		Probability Density // Tools to calculate trait probability
		density functions (TPD) at any scale (e.g. populations,
		species, communities). TPD functions are used to compute
		several indices of functional diversity, as well as its
		partition across scales. These indices constitute a unified
		framework that incorporates the underlying probabilistic nature
		of trait distributions into uni- or multidimensional functional
		trait-based studies. See Carmona et al. (2016)
		doi:10.1016/j.tree.2016.02.003 for further information.
