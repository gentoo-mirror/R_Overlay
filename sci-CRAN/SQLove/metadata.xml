		Execute 'SQL' Scripts in 'R' Containing Multiple Queries // The
		nature of working with structured query language ('SQL')
		scripts efficiently often requires the creation of temporary
		tables and there are few clean and simple 'R' 'SQL' execution
		approaches that allow you to complete this kind of work with
		the 'R' environment. This package seeks to give 'SQL'
		implementations in 'R' a little love by deploying functions
		that allow you to deploy complex 'SQL' scripts within a typical
		'R' workflow.
