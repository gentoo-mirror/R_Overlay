		Ordinal Time Series Analysis // An implementation of several
		functions for feature extraction in ordinal time series
		datasets. Specifically, some of the features proposed by Weiss
		(2019) doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1604370 can be computed. These
		features can be used to perform inferential tasks or to feed
		machine learning algorithms for ordinal time series, among
		others. The package also includes some interesting datasets
		containing financial time series. Practitioners from a broad
		variety of fields could benefit from the general framework
		provided by 'otsfeatures'.
