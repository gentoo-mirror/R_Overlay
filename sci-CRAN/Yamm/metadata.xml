		Multivariate Methods Based on Projections and Related Concepts //
		Functionality to compute the projection median via several
		algorithms. This package also provides functions to plot
		different multivariate medians and multivariate quantiles in
		two-dimensional and three-dimensional data respectively. See
		Chen, F. and Nason, G.P. (2020) "A new method for computing the
		projection median, its influence curve and techniques for the
		production of projected quantile plots." PLOS One (accepted for
