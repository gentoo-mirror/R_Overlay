		Statistical Inference for Enzyme Kinetics // Functions for
		estimating catalytic constant and Michaelis-Menten constant (MM
		constant) of stochastic Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics model
		are provided. The likelihood functions based on stochastic
		simulation approximation (SSA), diffusion approximation (DA),
		and Gaussian processes (GP) are provided to construct posterior
		functions for the Bayesian estimation. All functions utilize
		Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with Metropolis-
		Hastings algorithm with random walk chain and robust adaptive
		Metropolis-Hastings algorithm based on Bayesian framework.
