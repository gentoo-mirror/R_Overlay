		Extended Structural Equation Modelling // Facilitates treatment
		of statistical model specifications as things that can be
		generated and manipulated programmatically. Structural equation
		models may be specified with reticular action model matrices or
		paths, linear structural relations matrices or paths, or
		directly in matrix algebra. Fit functions include full
		information maximum likelihood, maximum likelihood, and
		weighted least squares. Example models include confirmatory
		factor, multiple group, mixture distribution, categorical
		threshold, modern test theory, differential equations, state
		space, and many others.  MacOS users can download the most up-
		to-date package binaries from http://openmx.ssri.psu.edu. See
