		Time Series Artificial Neural Network // The best ANN structure
		for time series data analysis is a demanding need in the
		present era. This package will find the best-fitted ANN model
		based on forecasting accuracy. The optimum size of the hidden
		layers was also determined after determining the number of lags
		to be included. This package has been developed using the
		algorithm of Paul and Garai (2021)
