		Ensemble Meta-Prediction Framework // An ensemble meta-prediction
		framework to integrate multiple regression models into a
		current study. Gu, T., Taylor, J.M.G. and Mukherjee, B. (2020)
		arXiv:2010.09971. A meta-analysis framework along with two
		weighted estimators as the ensemble of empirical Bayes
		estimators, which combines the estimates from the different
		external models. The proposed framework is flexible and robust
		in the ways that (i) it is capable of incorporating external
		models that use a slightly different set of covariates; (ii) it
		is able to identify the most relevant external information and
		diminish the influence of information that is less compatible
		with the internal data; and (iii) it nicely balances the bias-
		variance trade-off while preserving the most efficiency gain.
		The proposed estimators are more efficient than the naive
		analysis of the internal data and other naive combinations of
		external estimators.
