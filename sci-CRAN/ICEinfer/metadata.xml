		Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Inference on Two Unbiased Samples
		// Given two unbiased samples of patient level data on cost and
		effectiveness for a pair of treatments, make head-to-head
		treatment comparisons by (i) generating the bivariate bootstrap
		resampling distribution of ICE uncertainty for a specified
		value of the shadow price of health, lambda, (ii) form the
		wedge-shaped ICE confidence region with specified confidence
		fraction within [0.50, 0.99] that is equivariant with respect
		to changes in lambda, (iii) color the bootstrap outcomes within
		the above confidence wedge with economic preferences from an
		ICE map with specified values of lambda, beta and gamma
		parameters, (iv) display VAGR and ALICE acceptability curves,
		and (v) illustrate variation in ICE preferences by displaying
		potentially non-linear indifference(iso-preference) curves from
		an ICE map with specified values of lambda, beta and either
		gamma or eta parameters.
