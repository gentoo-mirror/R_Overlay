		GWAS with Trio and Duo Data using Knockoff Statistics for FDR
		Control // Identification of putative causal variants in
		genome-wide association studies with trio and duo families. The
		package calculates the W feature statistics from KnockoffTrio
		and p-values from the family-based association test (FBAT)
		using trio and/or duo data. Compared to previous versions, a
		significant improvement has been made in Version 1.1.0 to allow
		the package to be applied not only to trio families but also to
		duo families. The package implements the methods in the paper:
		"Yang, Y., Wang, C., Liu, L., Buxbaum, J., He, Z.,  Ionita-
		Laza, I. (2022). KnockoffTrio: A knockoff framework for the
		identification of putative causal variants in genome-wide
		association studies with trio design. The American Journal of
		Human Genetics, 109(10), 1761-1776."
