		Bayesian Regions of Evidence to systematically evaluate the
		sensitivity of a superiority or non-inferiority claim against
		any prior assumption of its assessors. Methodological details
		are elaborated by Hoefler and Miller (2023)

		also provides an intuitive 'Shiny' application, that can be run
		in local R environments.
