		Estimate the Number of Factors in Large Nonstationary Datasets //
		Large panel data sets are often subject to common trends.
		However, it can be difficult to determine the exact number of
		these common factors and analyse their properties. The package
		implements the Barigozzi and Trapani (2022)
		doi:10.1080/07350015.2021.1901719 test, which not only provides
		an efficient way of estimating the number of common factors in
		large nonstationary panel data sets, but also gives further
		insights on factor classes. The routine identifies the
		existence of (i) a factor subject to a linear trend, (ii) the
		number of zero-mean I(1) and (iii) zero-mean I(0) factors.
		Furthermore, the package includes the Integrated Panel Criteria
		by Bai (2004) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2003.10.022 that provide a
		complementary measure for the number of factors.
