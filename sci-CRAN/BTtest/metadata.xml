		Estimate the Number of Factors in Large Nonstationary Datasets //
		Implementation of the Barigozzi and Trapani (2022)
		doi:10.1080/07350015.2021.1901719 test for the number of common
		factors in large nonstationary panel data sets. The routine
		identifies the existence of (i) a factor subject to a linear
		trend, (ii) the number of zero-mean I(1) and (iii) zero-mean
		I(0) factors. Furthermore, the package includes the Integrated
		Panel Criteria by Bai (2004) doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2003.10.022
		that provide a complementary measure for the number of factors
		in nonstationary panels.
