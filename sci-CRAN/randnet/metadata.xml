		Random Network Model Estimation, Selection and Parameter Tuning
		// Model selection and parameter tuning procedures for a class
		of random network models. The model selection can be done by a
		general cross-validation framework called ECV from Li et. al.
		(2016) arXiv:1612.04717 . Several other model-based and task-
		specific methods are also included, such as NCV from Chen and
		Lei (2016) arXiv:1411.1715, likelihood ratio method from Wang
		and Bickel (2015) arXiv:1502.02069, spectral methods from Le
		and Levina (2015) arXiv:1507.00827. Many network analysis
		methods are also implemented, such as the regularized spectral
		clustering (Amini et. al. 2013 doi:10.1214/13-AOS1138) and its
		degree corrected version and graphon neighborhood smoothing
		(Zhang et. al. 2015 arXiv:1509.08588). It also includes the
		consensus clustering of Gao et. al. (2014) arXiv:1410.5837, the
		method of moments estimation of nomination SBM of Li et. al.
		(2020) arxiv:2008.03652, and the network mixing method of Li
		and Le (2021) arxiv:2106.02803. It also includes the
		informative core-periphery data processing method of Miao and
		Li (2021) arXiv:2101.06388. The work to build and improve this
		package is partially supported by the NSF grants DMS-2015298
		and DMS-2015134.
