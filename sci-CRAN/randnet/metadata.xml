		Random Network Model Estimation, Selection and Parameter Tuning
		// Model selection and parameter tuning procedures for a class
		of random network models. The model selection can be done by a
		general cross-validation framework called ECV from Li et. al.
		(2016) arXiv:1612.04717 . Several other model-based and task-
		specific methods are also included, such as NCV from Chen and
		Lei (2016) arXiv:1411.1715, likelihood ratio method from Wang
		and Bickel (2015) arXiv:1502.02069, spectral methods from Le
		and Levina (2015) arXiv:1507.00827. Many network analysis
		methods are also implemented, such as the regularized spectral
		clustering (Amini et. al. 2013 doi:10.1214/13-AOS1138) and its
		degree corrected version and graphon neighborhood smoothing
		(Zhang et. al. 2015 arXiv:1509.08588). It also includes the
		consensus clustering of Gao et. al. (2014) arXiv:1410.5837 and
		the method of moments estimation of nomination SBM of Li et.
		al. (2020) arxiv:2008.03652.
