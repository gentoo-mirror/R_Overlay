		Multivariate Markov Chains // Provides routines to estimate the
		Mixture Transition Distribution Model based on Raftery (1985)
		http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345788 and Nicolau (2014)
		doi:10.1111/sjos.12087 specifications, for multivariate data.
		Additionally, provides a function for the estimation of a new
		model for multivariate non-homogeneous Markov chains. This new
		specification, Generalized Multivariate Markov Chains (GMMC)
		was proposed by Carolina Vasconcelos and Bruno Damasio and
		considers (continuous or discrete) covariates exogenous to the
		Markov chain.
