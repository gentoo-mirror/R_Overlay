		Online Change Point Detection for Matrix-Valued Time Series // We
		provide two algorithms for monitoring change points with online
		matrix-valued time series, under the assumption of a two-way
		factor structure. The algorithms are based on different
		calculations of the second moment matrices. One is based on
		stacking the columns of matrix observations, while another is
		by a more delicate projected approach. A well-known fact is
		that, in the presence of a change point, a factor model can be
		rewritten as a model with a larger number of common factors. In
		turn, this entails that, in the presence of a change point, the
		number of spiked eigenvalues in the second moment matrix of the
		data increases. Based on this, we propose two families of
		procedures - one based on the fluctuations of partial sums, and
		one based on extreme value theory - to monitor whether the
		first non-spiked eigenvalue diverges after a point in time in
		the monitoring horizon, thereby indicating the presence of a
		change point. This package also provides some simple functions
		for detecting and removing outliers, imputing missing entries
		and testing moments. See more details in He et al.
