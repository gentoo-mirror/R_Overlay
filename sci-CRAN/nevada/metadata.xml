		Network-Valued Data Analysis // A flexible statistical framework
		for network-valued data analysis. It leverages the complexity
		of the space of distributions on graphs by using the
		permutation framework for inference as implemented in the
		'flipr' package. Currently, only the two-sample testing problem
		is covered and generalization to k samples and regression will
		be added in the future as well. It is a 4-step procedure where
		the user chooses a suitable representation of the networks, a
		suitable metric to embed the representation into a metric
		space, one or more test statistics to target specific aspects
		of the distributions to be compared and a formula to compute
		the permutation p-value. Two types of inference are provided: a
		global test answering whether there is a difference between the
		distributions that generated the two samples and a local test
		for localizing differences on the network structure. The latter
		is assumed to be shared by all networks of both samples.
