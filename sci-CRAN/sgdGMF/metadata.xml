		Estimation of Generalized Matrix Factorization Models via
		Stochastic Gradient Descent // Efficient framework to estimate
		high-dimensional generalized matrix factorization models using
		penalized maximum likelihood under a dispersion exponential
		family specification. Either deterministic and stochastic
		methods are implemented for the numerical maximization. In
		particular, the package implements the stochastic gradient
		descent algorithm with a block-wise mini-batch strategy to
		speed up the computations and an efficient adaptive learning
		rate schedule to stabilize the convergence. All the theoretical
		details can be found in Castiglione et al. (2024,
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.20509). Other methods considered for
		the optimization are the alternated iterative re-weighted least
		squares and the quasi-Newton method with diagonal approximation
		of the Fisher information matrix discussed in Kidzinski et al.
		(2022, http://jmlr.org/papers/v23/20-1104.html).
