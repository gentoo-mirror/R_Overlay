		Producing Load Shape with Target Peak and Load Factor //
		Modifying a load shape to match specific peak and load factor
		is a fundamental component for various power system planning
		and operation studies. This package is an efficient tool to
		modify a reference load shape while matching the desired peak
		and load factor. The package offers both linear and non-linear
		method, described in
		https://rpubs.com/riazakhan94/load_shape_match_peak_energy. The
		user can control the shape of the final load shape by
		regulating certain parameters. The package provides validation
		metrics for assessing the derived load shape in terms of
		preserving time series properties. It also offers powerful
		graphics, that allows the user to visually assess the derived
		load shape.
