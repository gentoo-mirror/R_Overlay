		Vertical Distributed Regression Analysis // Implements linear,
		logistic, and Cox regression on vertically partitioned data
		across several data partners.  Data is not shared between data
		partners or the analysis center and the computations can be
		considered secure.  Three different protocols are implemented.
		2-Party: two data partners which communicate directly without
		an intermediate analysis center; 2T-Party: two data partners
		communicate indirectly via an analysis center, and KT-Party:
		two or more data partners plus an analysis center are all
		allowed to communicate directly.  2-Party and 2^T-Party use a
		form of secure multiplication as found in Karr, et. al. (2009)
		"Privacy-Preserving Analysis of Vertically Partitioned Data
		Using Secure Matrix Products" and Slavkovic et. al. (2007)
		"Secure Logistic Regression of Horizontally and Vertically
		Partitioned Distributed Databases" doi:10.1109/ICDMW.2007.114.
		Full details can be found in Samizo (In preparation).
