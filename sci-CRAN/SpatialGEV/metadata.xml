		Fit Spatial Generalized Extreme Value Models // Fit latent
		variable models with the GEV distribution as the data
		likelihood and the GEV parameters following latent Gaussian
		processes. The models in this package are built using the
		template model builder 'TMB' in R, which has the fast ability
		to integrate out the latent variables using Laplace
		approximation. This package allows the users to choose in the
		fit function which GEV parameter(s) is considered as a
		spatially varying random effect following a Gaussian process,
		so the users can fit spatial GEV models with different
		complexities to their dataset without having to write the
		models in 'TMB' by themselves. This package also offers methods
		to sample from both fixed and random effects posteriors as well
		as the posterior predictive distributions at different spatial
		locations. Methods for fitting this class of models are
		described in Chen, Ramezan, and Lysy (2021) arXiv:2110.07051.
