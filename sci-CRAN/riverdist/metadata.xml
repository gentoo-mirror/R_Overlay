		River Network Distance Computation and Applications // Reads
		river network shape files and computes network distances. Also
		included are a variety of computation and graphical tools
		designed for fisheries telemetry research, such as minimum home
		range, kernel density estimation, and clustering analysis using
		empirical k-functions with a bootstrap envelope.  Tools are
		also provided for editing the river networks, meaning there is
		no reliance on external software.
