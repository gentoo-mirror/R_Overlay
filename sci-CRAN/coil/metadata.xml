		Contextualization and Evaluation of COI-5P Barcode Data //
		Designed for the cleaning, contextualization and assessment of
		cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcode data (COI-5P, or the five
		prime portion of COI). It contains functions for placing COI-5P
		barcode sequences into a common reading frame, translating DNA
		sequences to amino acids and for assessing the likelihood that
		a given barcode sequence includes an insertion or deletion
		error. The error assessment relies on the comparison of input
		sequences against nucleotide and amino acid profile hidden
		Markov models (PHMMs) (for details see Durbin et al. 1998,
		ISBN: 9780521629713) trained on a taxonomically diverse set of
		reference sequences. The functions are provided as a complete
		pipeline and are also available individually for efficient and
		targeted analysis of barcode data.
