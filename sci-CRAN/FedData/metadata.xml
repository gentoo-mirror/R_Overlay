		Several Federated Data Sources // Functions to automate
		downloading geospatial data available from several federated
		data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal
		government). Currently, the package allows for retrieval of
		five datasets: The National Elevation Dataset digital elevation
		models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS); The National Hydrography
		Dataset (USGS); The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database
		from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led
		by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the
		USDA; the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN),
		coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA; the
		Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North
		America, version 3, available from the Oak Ridge National
		Laboratory's Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC); and the
		International Tree Ring Data Bank. Additional data sources are
		in the works, global soils (HWSD), MODIS satellite data
		products, the National Atlas (US), Natural Earth, and
		WorldClim.
