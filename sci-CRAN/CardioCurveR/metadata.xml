		Nonlinear Modeling of R-R Interval Dynamics // Automated and
		robust framework for analyzing R-R interval (RRi) signals using
		advanced nonlinear modeling and preprocessing techniques. The
		package implements a dual-logistic model to capture the rapid
		drop and subsequent recovery of RRi during exercise, as
		described by Castillo-Aguilar et al. (2025)
		doi:10.1038/s41598-025-93654-6. In addition, 'CardioCurveR'
		includes tools for filtering RRi signals using zero-phase
		Butterworth low-pass filtering and for cleaning ectopic beats
		via adaptive outlier replacement using local regression and
		robust statistics. These integrated methods preserve the
		dynamic features of RRi signals and facilitate accurate
		cardiovascular monitoring and clinical research.
