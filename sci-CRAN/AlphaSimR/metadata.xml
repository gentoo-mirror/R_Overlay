		Breeding Program Simulations // The successor to the 'AlphaSim'
		software for breeding program simulation (Faux et al., 2016,
		doi:10.3835/plantgenome2016.02.0013). Used for stochastic
		simulations of breeding programs to the level of DNA sequence
		for every individual. Contained is a wide range of functions
		for modeling common tasks in a breeding program, such as
		selection and crossing. These functions allow for constructing
		simulations of highly complex plant and animal breeding
		programs via scripting in the R software environment. Such
		simulations can be used to evaluate overall breeding program
		performance and conduct research into breeding program design,
		such as implementation of genomic selection. Included is the
		'Markovian Coalescent Simulator' ('MaCS') for fast simulation
		of biallelic sequences according to a population demographic
		history (Chen et al., 2009, doi:10.1101/gr.083634.108).
