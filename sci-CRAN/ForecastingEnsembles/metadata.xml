		Time Series Forecasting Using 23 Individual Models // Runs
		multiple individual time series models, and combines them into
		an ensembles of time series models. This is mainly used to
		predict the results of the monthly labor market report from the
		United States Bureau of Labor Statistics for virtually any part
		of the economy reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but
		it can be easily modified to work with other types of time
		series data. For example, the package was used to predict the
		winning men's and women's time for the 2024 London Marathon.
