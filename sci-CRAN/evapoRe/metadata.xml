		Evapotranspiration R Recipes // An R-based application for
		exploratory data analysis of global EvapoTranspiration (ET)
		datasets. 'evapoRe' enables users to download, validate,
		visualize, and analyze multi-source ET data across various
		spatio-temporal scales. Also, the package offers calculation
		methods for estimating potential ET (PET), including
		temperature-based approaches described in : Oudin et al.,
		(2005) doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.08.026. 'evapoRe' supports
		hydrological modeling, climate studies, agricultural research,
		and other data-driven fields by facilitating access to ET data
		and offering powerful analysis capabilities. Users can
		seamlessly integrate the package into their research
		applications and explore diverse ET data at different
		resolutions.
