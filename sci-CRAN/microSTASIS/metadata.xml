		Microbiota STability ASsessment via Iterative cluStering // The
		toolkit 'STASIS' has been developed for the stability analysis
		of microbiota in a temporal framework by leveraging on
		iterative clustering. Concretely, the core function uses
		Hartigan-Wong k-means algorithm as many times as possible for
		stressing out paired samples from the same individuals to test
		if they remain together for multiple numbers of clusters over a
		whole data set of individuals. Moreover, the package includes
		multiple functions to subset samples from paired times,
		validate the results or visualize the output.
