		Pseudo-Likelihood Estimation of Log-Multiplicative Association
		Models // Log-multiplicative association models (LMA) are
		models for cross-classifications of categorical variables where
		interactions are represented by products of category scale
		values and an association parameter. Maximum likelihood
		estimation (MLE) fails for moderate to large numbers of
		categorical variables. The 'pleLMA' package overcomes this
		limitation of MLE by using pseudo-likelihood estimation to fit
		the models to small or large cross-classifications dichotomous
		or multi-category variables. Originally proposed by Besag
		(1974, doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1974.tb00999.x), pseudo-
		likelihood estimation takes large complex models and breaks it
		down into smaller ones. Rather than maximizing the likelihood
		of the joint distribution of all the variables, a pseudo-
		likelihood function, which is the product likelihoods from
		conditional distributions, is maximized. LMA models can be
		derived from a number of different frameworks including (but
		not limited to) graphical models and uni-dimensional and multi-
		dimensional item response theory models. More details about the
		models and estimation can be found in the vignette.
