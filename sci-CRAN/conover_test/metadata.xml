		Conover-Iman Test of Multiple Comparisons Using Rank Sums //
		Computes the Conover-Iman test (1979) for stochastic dominance
		and reports the results among multiple pairwise comparisons
		after a Kruskal-Wallis test for stochastic dominance among k
		groups (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). The interpretation of
		stochastic dominance requires an assumption that the CDF of one
		group does not cross the CDF of the other. conover.test makes
		k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Conover-Iman
		t-test-statistic of the rank differences. The null hypothesis
		for each pairwise comparison is that the probability of
		observing a randomly selected value from the first group that
		is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group
		equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of
		the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum
		test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, and the
		distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in
		location, Conover-Iman test may be understood as a test for
		median difference. conover.test accounts for tied ranks. The
		Conover-Iman test is strictly valid if and only if the
		corresponding Kruskal-Wallis null hypothesis is rejected.
