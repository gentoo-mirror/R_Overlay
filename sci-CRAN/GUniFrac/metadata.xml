		Generalized UniFrac Distances, Distance-Based Multivariate
		Methods and Feature-Based Univariate Methods for Microbiome
		Data Analysis // A suite of methods for powerful and robust
		microbiome data analysis including data normalization, data
		simulation, community-level association testing and
		differential abundance analysis. It implements generalized
		UniFrac distances,  Geometric Mean of Pairwise Ratios (GMPR)
		normalization, semiparametric data simulator, distance-based
		statistical methods, and feature-based statistical methods. The
		distance-based statistical methods include three extensions of
		PERMANOVA: (1) PERMANOVA using the Freedman-Lane permutation
		scheme, (2) PERMANOVA omnibus test using multiple matrices, and
		(3) analytical approach to approximating PERMANOVA p-value.
		Feature-based statistical methods include linear model-based
		permutation tests for differential abundance analysis of zero-
		inflated compositional data.
