		ing.pdf learning rule, and essentially the same as Rescorla-
		Wagner's learning equations (Rescorla  Wagner, 1972, ISBN:
		0390718017), which are also at the core of Naive Discrimination
		Learning, (Baayen et al, 2011, doi:10.1037/a0023851) can be
		used to explain bottom-up human learning (Hoppe et al,
		doi:10.31234/osf.io/py5kd), but is also at the core of
		artificial neural networks applications in the form of the
		Delta rule. This package provides a set of functions for
		building small-scale simulations to investigate the dynamics of
		error-driven learning and it's interaction with the structure
		of the input. For modeling error-driven learning using the
		Rescorla-Wagner equations the package 'ndl' (Baayen et al,
		2011, doi:10.1037/a0023851) is available on CRAN at
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=ndl. However, the package
		currently only allows tracing of a cue-outcome combination,
		rather than returning the learned networks. To fill this gap,
		we implemented a new package with a few functions that
		facilitate inspection of the networks for small error driven
		learning simulations. Note that our functions are not optimized
		for training large data sets (no parallel processing), as they
		are intended for small scale simulations and course examples.
		(Consider the python implementation 'pyndl'
		https://pyndl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for that purpose.)
