		Algorithm Portfolio Selection with Machine Learning // A wrapper
		for machine learning (ML) methods to select among a portfolio
		of algorithms based on the value of a key performance indicator
		(KPI). A number of features is used to adjust a model to
		predict the value of the KPI for each algorithm, then, for a
		new value of the features the KPI is estimated and the
		algorithm with the best one is chosen. To learn it can use the
		regression methods in 'caret' package or a custom function
		defined by the user. Several graphics available to analyze the
		results obtained. This library has been used in Ghaddar et al.
