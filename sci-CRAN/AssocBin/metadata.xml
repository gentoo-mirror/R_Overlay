		Measuring Association with Recursive Binning // An iterative
		implementation of a recursive binary partitioning algorithm to
		measure pairwise dependence with a modular design that allows
		user specification of the splitting logic and stop criteria.
		Helper functions provide suggested versions of both and support
		visualization and the computation of summary statistics on
		final binnings. For a complete description of the functionality
		and algorithm, see Salahub and Oldford (2023) arxiv:2311.08561.
