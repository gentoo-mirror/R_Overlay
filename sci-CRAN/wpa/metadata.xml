		Tools for Analysing and Visualising Viva Insights Data //
		Opinionated functions that enable easier and faster analysis of
		Viva Insights data. There are three main types of functions in
		'wpa': (i) Standard functions create a 'ggplot' visual or a
		summary table based on a specific Viva Insights metric; (2)
		Report Generation functions generate HTML reports on a specific
		analysis area, e.g. Collaboration; (3) Other miscellaneous
		functions cover more specific applications (e.g. Subject Line
		text mining) of Viva Insights data. This package adheres to
		'tidyverse' principles and works well with the pipe syntax.
		'wpa' is built with the beginner-to-intermediate R users in
		mind, and is optimised for simplicity.
