		Tools for Analysing and Visualising Workplace Analytics Data //
		Opinionated functions that enable easier and faster analysis of
		Workplace Analytics data. There are three main types of
		functions in 'wpa': (i) Standard functions create a 'ggplot'
		visual or a summary table based on a specific Workplace
		Analytics metric; (2) Report Generation functions generate HTML
		reports on a specific analysis area, e.g. Collaboration; (3)
		Other miscellaneous functions cover more specific applications
		(e.g. Subject Line text mining) of Workplace Analytics data.
		This package adheres to 'tidyverse' principles and works well
		with the pipe syntax. 'wpa' is built with the beginner-to-
		intermediate R users in mind, and is optimised for simplicity.
