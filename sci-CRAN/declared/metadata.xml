		Functions for Declared Missing Values // A zero dependency
		package containing functions to declare labels and missing
		values, coupled with associated functions to create (weighted)
		tables of frequencies and various other summary measures. Some
		of the base functions have been rewritten to make use of the
		specific information about the missing values, most importantly
		to distinguish between empty NA and declared NA values. Some
		functions have similar functionality with the corresponding
		ones from packages "haven" and "labelled". The aim is to ensure
		as much compatibility as possible with these packages, while
		offering an alternative in the objects of class "declared".
