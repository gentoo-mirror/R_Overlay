		Functions to Declare Missing Values // A set of functions to
		declare labels and missing values, coupled with associated
		functions to create (weighted) tables of frequencies and
		various other summary measures. Various base functions are
		rewritten to make use of the specific information about the
		missing values, most importantly to distinguish between empty
		and declared missing values. Many functions have a similar
		functionality with the corresponding functions from packages
		"haven" and "labelled". A lot of effort was spent to ensure as
		much compatibility as possible with these packages, with the
		intention to offer a complementary alternative for the objects
		of class "declared".
