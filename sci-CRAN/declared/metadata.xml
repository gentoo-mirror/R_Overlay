		Functions to Declare Missing Values // A set of functions to
		declare labels and missing values, coupled with associated
		functions to create (weighted) tables of frequencies and
		various other summary measures. Some of the base functions have
		been rewritten to make use of the specific information about
		the missing values, most importantly to distinguish between
		empty and declared missing values. Many functions have a
		similar functionality with the corresponding ones from packages
		"haven" and "labelled". The aim is to ensure as much
		compatibility as possible with these packages, while offering
		an alternative in the objects of class "declared".
