		Continuous Time Distance-Based and Network-Based Individual Level
		Models for Epidemics // Provides tools for simulating from
		continuous-time individual level models of disease
		transmission, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses
		with the same models. The epidemic models considered are
		distance-based and/or contact network-based models within
		Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-
		Notified-Removed (SINR) compartmental frameworks.
