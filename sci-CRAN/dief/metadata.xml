		Metrics for Continuous Efficiency // An implementation of the
		metrics dief@t and dief@k to measure the diefficiency (or
		continuous efficiency) of incremental approaches, see Acosta,
		M., Vidal, M. E.,  Sure-Vetter, Y. (2017)
		doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68204-4_1. The metrics dief@t and dief@k
		allow for measuring the diefficiency during an elapsed time
		period t or while k answers are produced, respectively. dief@t
		and dief@k rely on the computation of the area under the curve
		of answer traces, and thus capturing the answer rate
		concentration over a time interval.
