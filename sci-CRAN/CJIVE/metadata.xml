		Canonical Joint and Individual Variation Explained (CJIVE) //
		Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) is a method for
		decomposing multiple datasets obtained on the same subjects
		into shared structure, structure unique to each dataset, and
		noise. The two most common implementations are R.JIVE, an
		iterative approach, and AJIVE, which uses principal angle
		analysis. JIVE estimates subspaces but interpreting these
		subspaces can be challenging with AJIVE or R.JIVE. We expand
		upon insights into AJIVE as a canonical correlation analysis
		(CCA) of principal component scores. This reformulation, which
		we call CJIVE, 1) provides an ordering of joint components by
		the degree of correlation between corresponding canonical
		variables; 2) uses a computationally efficient permutation test
		for the number of joint components, which provides a p-value
		for each component; and 3) can be used to predict subject
		scores for out-of-sample observations. Please cite the
		following article when utilizing this package: Murden, R.,
