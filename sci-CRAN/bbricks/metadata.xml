		Bayesian Methods and Graphical Model Structures for Statistical
		Modeling // A set of frequently used Bayesian parametric and
		nonparametric model structures, as well as a set of tools for
		common analytical tasks. Structures include linear Gaussian
		systems, Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Wishart conjugate
		structure, Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Gamma conjugate
		structure, Categorical and Dirichlet conjugate structure,
		Dirichlet Process on positive integers, Dirichlet Process in
		general, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process ... Tasks include
		updating posteriors, sampling from posteriors, calculating
		marginal likelihood, calculating posterior predictive
		densities, sampling from posterior predictive distributions,
		calculating "Maximum A Posteriori" (MAP) estimates ... See
