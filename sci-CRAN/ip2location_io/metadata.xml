		Batch IP Data Retrieval and Storage Using 'IP2Location.io' // A
		system for submitting multiple IP information queries to
		'IP2Location.io's IP Geolocation API and storing the resulting
		data in a dataframe. You provide a vector of IP addresses and
		your 'IP2Location.io' API key. The package returns a dataframe
		with one row per IP address and a column for each available
		data field (data fields not included in your API plan will
		contain NAs). This is the second submission of the package to
		CRAN.
