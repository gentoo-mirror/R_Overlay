		Bayesian Test Reliability Estimation // When samples contain
		missing data, are small, or are suspected of bias, estimation
		of scale reliability may not be trustworthy.  A recommended
		solution for this common problem has been Bayesian model
		estimation.  Bayesian methods rely on user specified
		information from historical data or researcher intuition to
		more accurately estimate the parameters.  This package provides
		a user friendly interface for estimating test reliability.
		Here, reliability is modeled as a beta distributed random
		variable with shape parameters alpha=true score variance and
		beta=error variance (Tanzer, 2020) https://smep.org/.
