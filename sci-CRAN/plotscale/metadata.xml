		Scale Graphics Devices Using Plot Dimensions // Figures rendered
		on graphics devices are usually rescaled to fit pre-determined
		device dimensions. 'plotscale' implements the reverse: desired
		plot dimensions are specified and device dimensions are
		calculated to accommodate marginal material, giving consistent
		proportions for plot elements. Default methods support grid
		graphics such as lattice and ggplot. See "example('devsize')"
		and "vignette('plotscale')".
