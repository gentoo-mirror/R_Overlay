		Visualize Alpha-Helical Peptide Sequences // Create pretty
		visualizations of alpha-helical peptide sequences in R. The
		amino acid type (polar, hydrophobic, etc.) is denoted by color.
		This package allows creation of helical wheels and Wenxiang
		diagrams. Future versions aim to include increased
		customization of the two existing visualizations, as well as a
		visualization for the helical net diagram.
