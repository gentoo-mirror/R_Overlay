		CFO-Type Designs in Phase I Clinical Trials // In phase I
		clinical trials, the primary objective is to ascertain the
		maximum tolerated dose (MTD) corresponding to a specified
		target toxicity rate. The 'CFO' package facilitates the
		implementation of dose-finding trials by utilizing calibration-
		free odds type (CFO-type) designs. Specifically, it encompasses
		the calibration-free odds (CFO) (Jin and Yin (2022)
		doi:10.1177/09622802221079353), two-dimensional CFO (2dCFO)
		(Wang et al. (2023) doi:10.3389/fonc.2023.1294258), time-to-
		event CFO (TITE-CFO) (Jin and Yin (2023) doi:10.1002/pst.2304),
		fractional CFO (fCFO), accumulative CFO (aCFO), TITE-aCFO, and
		f-aCFO designs (Fang and Yin (2024) doi: 10.1002/sim.10127).
		The CFO' package accommodates diverse CFO-type designs,
		allowing users to tailor the approach based on factors such as
		dose information inclusion, handling of late-onset toxicity,
		and the nature of the target drug (single-drug or drug-
		combination). The functionalities embedded in 'CFO' package
		include the determination of the dose level for the next
		cohort, the selection of the MTD for a real trial, and the
		execution of single or multiple simulations to obtain operating
		characteristics. Moreover, these functions are equipped with
		early stopping and dose elimination rules to address safety
		considerations. Users have the flexibility to choose different
		distributions, thresholds, and cohort sizes among others for
		their specific needs. The output of the 'CFO' package can be
		summary statistics as well as various plots for better
		visualization.
