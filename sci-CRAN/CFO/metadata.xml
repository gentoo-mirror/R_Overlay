		CFO-Type Designs in Phase I/II Clinical Trials // In phase I
		clinical trials, the primary objective is to ascertain the
		maximum tolerated dose (MTD) corresponding to a specified
		target toxicity rate. The subsequent phase II trials are
		designed to examine the potential efficacy of the drug based on
		the MTD obtained from the phase I trials, with the aim of
		identifying the optimal biological dose (OBD). The 'CFO'
		package facilitates the implementation of dose-finding trials
		by utilizing calibration-free odds type (CFO-type) designs.
		Specifically, it encompasses the calibration-free odds (CFO)
		(Jin and Yin (2022) doi:10.1177/09622802221079353), randomized
		CFO (rCFO), two-dimensional CFO (2dCFO) (Wang et al. (2023)
		doi:10.3389/fonc.2023.1294258), time-to-event CFO (TITE-CFO)
		(Jin and Yin (2023) doi:10.1002/pst.2304), fractional CFO
		(fCFO), accumulative CFO (aCFO), TITE-aCFO, and f-aCFO designs
		(Fang and Yin (2024) doi: 10.1002/sim.10127). It supports phase
		I/II trials for the CFO design and only phase I trials for the
		other CFO-type designs. The CFO' package accommodates diverse
		CFO-type designs, allowing users to tailor the approach based
		on factors such as dose information inclusion, handling of
		late-onset toxicity, and the nature of the target drug (single-
		drug or drug-combination). The functionalities embedded in
		'CFO' package include the determination of the dose level for
		the next cohort, the selection of the MTD for a real trial, and
		the execution of single or multiple simulations to obtain
		operating characteristics. Moreover, these functions are
		equipped with early stopping and dose elimination rules to
		address safety considerations. Users have the flexibility to
		choose different distributions, thresholds, and cohort sizes
		among others for their specific needs. The output of the 'CFO'
		package can be summary statistics as well as various plots for
		better visualization. An interactive web application for CFO is
		available at the provided URL.
