		Wrapper Functions for 'ODAM' (Open Data for Access and Mining)
		Web Services // 'ODAM' (Open Data for Access and Mining) is a
		framework that implements a simple way to make research data
		broadly accessible and fully available for reuse, including by
		a script language such as R. The main purpose is to make a data
		set accessible online with a minimal effort from the data
		provider, and to allow any scientists or bioinformaticians to
		be able to explore the data set and then extract a subpart or
		the totality of the data according to their needs. The Rodam
		package has only one class, 'odamws', that provides methods to
		allow you to retrieve online data using 'ODAM' Web Services.
		This obviously requires that data are implemented according the
		'ODAM' approach , namely that the data subsets were deposited
		in the suitable data repository in the form of TSV files
		associated with  their metadata also described  in TSV files.
		See https://inrae.github.io/ODAM/.
