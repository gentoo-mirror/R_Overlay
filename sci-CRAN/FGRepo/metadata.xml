		Functional Genomics Repository for POST-GWAS Analysis // A
		collection of datasets essential for functional genomic
		analysis. Gene names, gene positions, cytoband information,
		sourced from Ensembl and phenotypes association graph prepared
		from GWAScatalog are included. Data is available in both GRCh37
		and 38 builds. These datasets facilitate a wide range of
		genomic studies, including the identification of genetic
		variants, exploration of genomic features, and post-GWAS
		functional analysis.
