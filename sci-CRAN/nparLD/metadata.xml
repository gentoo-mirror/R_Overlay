		Nonparametric Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Factorial
		Experiments // Performs nonparametric analysis of longitudinal
		data in factorial experiments. Longitudinal data are those
		which are collected from the same subjects over time, and they
		frequently arise in biological sciences. Nonparametric methods
		do not require distributional assumptions, and are applicable
		to a variety of data types (continuous, discrete, purely
		ordinal, and dichotomous).  Such methods are also robust with
		respect to outliers and for small sample sizes.
