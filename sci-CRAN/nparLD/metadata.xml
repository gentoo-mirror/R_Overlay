		Nonparametric Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Factorial
		Experiments // The package "nparLD" is designed to perform
		nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data in factorial
		experiments. Longitudinal data are those which are collected
		from the same subjects over time, and they frequently arise in
		biological sciences. Nonparametric methods do not require
		distributional assumptions, and are applicable to a variety of
		data types (continuous, discrete, purely ordinal, and
		dichotomous).  Such methods are also robust with respect to
		outliers and for small sample sizes.
