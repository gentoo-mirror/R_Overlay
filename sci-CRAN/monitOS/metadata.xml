		Monitoring Overall Survival in Pivotal Trials in Indolent Cancers
		// These guidelines are meant to provide a pragmatic, yet
		rigorous, help to drug developers and decision makers, since
		they are shaped by three fundamental ingredients: the
		clinically determined margin of detriment on OS that is
		unacceptably high (delta null); the benefit on OS that is
		plausible given the mechanism of action of the novel
		intervention (delta alt); and the quantity of information (i.e.
		survival events) it is feasible to accrue given the clinical
		and drug development setting. The proposed guidelines
		facilitate transparent discussions between stakeholders
		focusing on the risks of erroneous decisions and what might be
		an acceptable trade-off between power and the false positive
		error rate.
