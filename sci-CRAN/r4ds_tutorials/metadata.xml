		Tutorials for "R for Data Science" // When assigned "R for Data
		Science" (Wickham, etinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023, ISBN:
		1492097402)), students should read the book and type in all the
		associated R commands themselves. Sadly, that never happens.
		These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their
		instructors to be sure) that all work has been completed. See
		Kane (2023) https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/i
		nstructions.html from the 'tutorial.helpers' package for a
		background discussion.
