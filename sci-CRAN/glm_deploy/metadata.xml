		'C' and 'Java' Source Code Generator for Fitted Glm Objects //
		Provides two functions that generate source code implementing
		the predict function of fitted glm objects. In this version,
		code can be generated for either 'C' or 'Java'. The idea is to
		provide a tool for the easy and fast deployment of glm
		predictive models into production. The source code generated by
		this package implements two function/methods. One of such
		functions implements the equivalent to
		predict(type="response"), while the second implements
		predict(type="link"). Source code is written to disk as a .c or
		.java file in the specified path. In the case of c, an .h file
		is also generated.
