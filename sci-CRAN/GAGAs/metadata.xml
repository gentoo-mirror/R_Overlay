		Global Adaptive Generative Adjustment Algorithm for Generalized
		Linear Models // Fits linear regression, logistic and
		multinomial regression models, Poisson regression, Cox model
		via Global Adaptive Generative Adjustment Algorithm. For more
		detailed information, see Bin Wang, Xiaofei Wang and Jianhua
		Guo (2022) arXiv:1911.00658. This paper provides the
		theoretical properties of Gaga linear model when the load
		matrix is orthogonal. Further study is going on for the
		nonorthogonal cases and generalized linear models. These works
		are in part supported by the National Natural Foundation of
		China (No.12171076).
