		Space-Time Change of Support // Spatio-temporal change of support
		(STCOS) methods are designed for statistical inference on
		geographic and time domains which differ from those on which
		the data were observed. In particular, a parsimonious class of
		STCOS models supporting Gaussian outcomes was introduced by
		Bradley, Wikle, and Holan doi:10.1002/sta4.94. The 'stcos'
		package contains tools which facilitate use of STCOS models.
