		Space-Time Change of Support // Spatio-temporal change of support
		(STCOS) methods are designed for statistical inference on
		geographic and/or time domains that differ from those on which
		the data were observed. 'stcos' implements a parsimonious class
		of Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models for STCOS with
		Gaussian outcomes introduced by Bradley, Wikle, and Holan
