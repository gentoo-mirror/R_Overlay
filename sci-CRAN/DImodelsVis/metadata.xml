		Visualising and Interpreting Statistical Models Fit to
		Compositional Data // Statistical models fit to compositional
		data are often difficult to interpret due to the sum to 1
		constraint on data variables. 'DImodelsVis' provides novel
		visualisations tools to aid with the interpretation of models
		fit to compositional data. All visualisations in the package
		are created using the 'ggplot2' plotting framework and can be
		extended like every other 'ggplot' object.
