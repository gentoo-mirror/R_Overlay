		Mating Environmental Designs // In breeding experiments, mating
		environmental (ME) designs are very popular as mating designs
		are directly implemented in the field environment using block
		or row-column designs. Here, three functions are given related
		to three new methods which will generate mating diallel cross
		designs (Hinkelmann and Kempthorne, 1963doi:10.2307/2333899) or
		mating environmental (ME) designs along with design parameters,
		C matrix, eigenvalues (EVs), degree of fractionations (DF) and
		canonical efficiency factor (CEF). Another one function is
		added to check the properties of a given ME diallel cross
		design.
