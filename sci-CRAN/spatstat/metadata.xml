		Spatial Point Pattern Analysis, Model-Fitting, Simulation, Tests
		// Comprehensive open-source toolbox for analysing Spatial
		Point Patterns. Focused mainly on two-dimensional point
		patterns, including multitype/marked points, in any spatial
		region. Also supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-
		time point patterns in any number of dimensions, point patterns
		on a linear network, and patterns of other geometrical objects.
		Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel images. Contains
		over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data
		analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model
		diagnostics, and formal inference. Data types include point
		patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images,
		tessellations, and linear networks. Exploratory methods include
		quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes,
		nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry
		plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity,
		relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth
		selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices,
		mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate
		effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-
		squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-
		Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for
		covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported. Parametric models can be
		fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(),
		slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include
		Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster
		processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may
		involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction,
		cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by
		maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and
		composite likelihood methods. A model can be fitted to a list
		of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the
		function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed
		effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to
		all the features listed above. Fitted point process models can
		be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a
		fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of
		deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model
		selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection (sdr).
		Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation
		envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage
		and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added
		variable plots.
