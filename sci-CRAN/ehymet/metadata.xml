		Methodologies for Functional Data Based on the Epigraph and
		Hypograph Indices // Implements methods for functional data
		analysis based on the epigraph and hypograph indices. These
		methods transform functional datasets, whether in one or
		multiple dimensions, into multivariate datasets. The
		transformation involves applying the epigraph, hypograph, and
		their modified versions to both the original curves and their
		first and second derivatives. The calculation of these indices
		is tailored to the dimensionality of the functional dataset,
		with special considerations for dependencies between dimensions
		in multidimensional cases. This approach extends traditional
		multivariate data analysis techniques to the functional data
		setting. A key application of this package is the EHyClus
		method, which enhances clustering analysis for functional data
		across one or multiple dimensions using the epigraph and
		hypograph indices. See Pulido et al. (2023)
