		Reimplementations of Functions Introduced Since R-3.0.0 //
		Functions introduced or changed since R v3.0.0 are re-
		implemented in this package. The backports are conditionally
		exported in order to let R resolve the function name to either
		the implemented backport, or the respective base version, if
		available. Package developers can make use of new functions or
		arguments by selectively importing specific backports to
		support older installations.
