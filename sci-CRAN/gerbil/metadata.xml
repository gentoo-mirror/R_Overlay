		Generalized Efficient Regression-Based Imputation with Latent
		Processes // Implements a new multiple imputation method that
		draws imputations from a latent joint multivariate normal model
		which underpins generally structured data. This model is
		constructed using a sequence of flexible conditional linear
		models that enables the resulting procedure to be efficiently
		implemented on high dimensional datasets in practice.
