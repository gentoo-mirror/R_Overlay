		Automated Stacked Ensemble Classifier for Severe Class Imbalance
		// A stacking solution for modeling imbalanced and severely
		skewed data. It automates the process of building homogeneous
		or heterogeneous stacked ensemble models by selecting "best"
		models according to different criteria. In doing so, it
		strategically searches for and selects diverse, high-performing
		base-learners to construct ensemble models optimized for skewed
		data. This package is particularly useful for addressing class
		imbalance in datasets, ensuring robust and effective model
		outcomes through advanced ensemble strategies which aim to
		stabilize the model, reduce its overfitting, and further
		improve its generalizability.
