		Automated Stacked Ensemble Classifier for Severe Class Imbalance
		// An AutoML algorithm is developed to construct homogeneous or
		heterogeneous stacked ensemble models using specified base-
		learners. Various criteria are employed to identify optimal
		models, enhancing diversity among them and resulting in more
		robust stacked ensembles. The algorithm optimizes the model by
		incorporating an increasing number of top-performing models to
		create a diverse combination. Presently, only models from
		'h2o.ai' are supported.
