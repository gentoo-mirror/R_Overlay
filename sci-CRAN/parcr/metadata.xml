		combinator functions, higher order functions that parse input.
		Construction of such parsers is transparent and easy. Their
		main application is the parsing of structured text files like
		those generated by laboratory instruments. Based on a paper by
		Hutton (1992) doi:10.1017/S0956796800000411.
