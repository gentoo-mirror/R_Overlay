		Create 'Java' Objects and Execute 'Java' Methods // Makes it
		possible to create 'Java' objects and to execute 'Java' methods
		from the 'R' environment. The 'Java' Virtual Machine is handled
		by a gateway server. Commands are sent to the server through a
		socket connection from the 'R' environment. Calls to 'Java'
		methods allow for vectors so that a particular method is
		iteratively run on each element of the vector. A score
		algorithm also makes the calls to 'Java' methods less
		restrictive. The gateway server relies on the runnable 'Java'
		library 'j4r.jar'. This library is licensed under the LGPL-3.
		Its sources are included in this package. To start the gateway
		server, 'Java' must be part of the path.
