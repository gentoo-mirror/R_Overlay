		Tools and Palettes for Bivariate Thematic Mapping // Provides a
		'ggplot2' centric approach to bivariate mapping. This is a
		technique that maps two quantities simultaneously rather than
		the single value that most thematic maps display. The package
		provides a suite of tools for calculating breaks using multiple
		different approaches, a selection of palettes appropriate for
		bivariate mapping and scale functions for 'ggplot2' calls that
		adds those palettes to maps. Tools for creating bivariate
		legends are also included.
