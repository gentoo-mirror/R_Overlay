		Approximate Optimal Transport Between Two-Dimensional Grids //
		Can be used for optimal transport between two-dimensional grids
		with respect to separable cost functions of l^p form. It
		utilizes the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to approximate so-called
		pivot measures: One-dimensional transport plans that fully
		describe the full transport, see G. Auricchio (2023)
		doi:10.4171/RLM/1026. For these, it offers methods for
		visualization and to extract the corresponding transport plans
		and costs. Additionally, related functions for one-dimensional
		optimal transport are available.
