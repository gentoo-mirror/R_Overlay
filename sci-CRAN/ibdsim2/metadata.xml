		Simulation of Chromosomal Regions Shared by Family Members //
		Simulation of segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) by
		pedigree members. Using sex specific recombination rates along
		the human genome (Halldorsson et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1126/science.aau1043), phased chromosomes are simulated
		for all pedigree members. Additional features include
		calculation of realised IBD coefficients and plots of IBD
		segment distributions.
