		Simulation of Chromosomal Regions Shared by Family Members //
		Simulation of segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) by
		pedigree members. Using sex specific recombination rates along
		the human genome (Halldorsson et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1126/science.aau1043), phased chromosomes are simulated
		for all pedigree members. Applications include calculation of
		realised relatedness coefficients and IBD segment
		distributions. 'ibdsim2' is part of the 'pedsuite' collection
		of packages for pedigree analysis. A detailed presentation of
		the 'pedsuite', including a separate chapter on 'ibdsim2', is
		available in the book 'Pedigree analysis in R' (Vigeland, 2021,
		ISBN:9780128244302). A 'Shiny' app for visualising and
		comparing IBD distributions is available at
		https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/ibdsim2-shiny/.
