		Methods for the Evaluation of Survival Models // Provides
		predictive accuracy tools to evaluate time-to-event survival
		models. This includes calculating the concordance probability
		estimate that incorporates the follow-up time for a particular
		study developed by Devlin, Gonen, Heller
		(2020)doi:10.1007/s10985-020-09503-3. It also evaluates the
		concordance probability estimate for nested Cox proportional
		hazards models using a projection-based approach by Heller and
		Devlin (under review).
