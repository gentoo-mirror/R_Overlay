		Bayesian Penalized Quantile Regression // Bayesian regularized
		quantile regression utilizing sparse priors to impose exact
		sparsity leads to efficient Bayesian shrinkage estimation,
		variable selection and statistical inference. In this package,
		we have implemented robust Bayesian variable selection with
		spike-and-slab priors under high-dimensional linear regression
		models (Fan et al. (2024) doi:10.3390/e26090794 and Ren et al.
		(2023) doi:10.1111/biom.13670), and regularized quantile
		varying coefficient models (Zhou et al.(2023)
		doi:10.1016/j.csda.2023.107808). In particular, valid robust
		Bayesian inferences under both models in the presence of heavy-
		tailed errors can be validated on finite samples. Additional
		models including robust Bayesian group LASSO are also included.
		The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms of the proposed
		and alternative models are implemented in C++.
