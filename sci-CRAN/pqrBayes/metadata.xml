		Bayesian Penalized Quantile Regression // The quantile varying
		coefficient model is robust to data heterogeneity, outliers and
		heavy-tailed distributions in the response variable. In
		addition, it can flexibly model dynamic patterns of regression
		coefficients through nonparametric varying coefficient
		functions. In this package, we have implemented the Gibbs
		samplers of the penalized Bayesian quantile varying coefficient
		model with spike-and-slab priors [Zhou et
		al.(2023)]doi:10.1016/j.csda.2023.107808 for efficient Bayesian
		shrinkage estimation, variable selection and statistical
		inference. In particular, valid Bayesian inferences on sparse
		quantile varying coefficient functions can be validated on
		finite samples. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms
		of the proposed and alternative models can be efficiently
		performed by using the package.
