		Cross-Entropy Clustering // Splits data into Gaussian type
		clusters using the Cross-Entropy Clustering ('CEC') method.
		This method allows for the simultaneous use of various types of
		Gaussian mixture models, for performing the reduction of
		unnecessary clusters, and for discovering new clusters by
		splitting them. 'CEC' is based on the work of Spurek, P. and
		Tabor, J. (2014) doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2014.03.006.
