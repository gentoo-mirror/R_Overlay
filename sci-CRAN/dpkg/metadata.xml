		Create, Stow, and Read Data Packages // Data frame, tibble, or
		tbl objects are converted to data package objects using
		specific metadata labels (name, version, title, homepage,
		description). A data package object ('dpkg') can be written to
		disk as a 'parquet' file or released to a 'GitHub' repository.
		Data package objects can be read into R from online
		repositories and downloaded files are cached locally across R
		sessions.
