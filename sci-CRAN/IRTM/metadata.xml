		Theory-Driven Item Response Theory (IRT) Models // IRT-M is a
		semi-supervised approach based on Bayesian Item Response Theory
		that produces theoretically identified underlying dimensions
		from input data and a constraints matrix. The methodology is
		fully described in 'Morucci et al. (2024), "Measurement That
		Matches Theory: Theory-Driven Identification in Item Response
		Theory Models"'. Details are available at
