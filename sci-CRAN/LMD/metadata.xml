		A Self-Adaptive Approach for Demodulating Multi-Component Signal
		// Local Mean Decomposition is an iterative and self-adaptive
		approach for demodulating, processing, and analyzing multi-
		component amplitude modulated and frequency modulated signals.
		This R package is based on the approach suggested by Smith
		(2005) doi:10.1098/rsif.2005.0058 and the 'Python' library
		'PyLMD'.
