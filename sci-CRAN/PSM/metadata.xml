		Non-Linear Mixed-Effects Modelling using Stochastic Differential
		Equations // Functions for fitting linear and non-linear mixed-
		effects models using stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
		The package allows for any multivariate non-linear time-variant
		model to be specified, and it also handles multidimensional
		input, covariates, missing observations, and specification of
		dosage regimen. The provided pipeline relies on the coupling of
		the FOCE algorithm and Kalman filtering as outlined by Klim et
		al (2009, doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2009.02.001) and has been
		validated against the proprietary software 'NONMEM' (Tornoe et
		al, 2005, doi:10.1007/s11095-005-5269-5). Further functions are
		provided for finding smoothed estimates of model states and for
		simulation.
