		Turn Place Names into Map Data // A tool for easily matching
		spatial data when you have a list of place/region names. You
		might have a data frame that came from a spreadsheet tracking
		some data by suburb or state. This package can convert it into
		a spatial data frame ready for plotting. The actual map data is
		provided by other packages (or your own code).
