		Null Model Analysis for Ecological Networks // Tools for using
		null models to analyse ecological networks (e.g. food webs,
		flower-visitation networks, seed-dispersal networks) and detect
		resource preferences or non-random interactions among network
		nodes. Tools are provided to run null models, test for and plot
		preferences, plot and analyse bipartite networks, and export
		null model results in a form compatible with other network
		analysis packages. The underlying null model was developed by
		Agusti et al. (2003) Molecular Ecology
		doi:10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02014.x and the full application
		to ecological networks by Vaughan et al. (2018) econullnetr: an
		R package using null models to analyse the structure of
		ecological networks and identify resource selection. Methods in
		Ecology  Evolution, doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12907.
