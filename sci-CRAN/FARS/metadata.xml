		Factor-Augmented Regression Scenarios // Provides a comprehensive
		framework in R for modeling and forecasting economic scenarios
		based on multi-level dynamic factor model. The package enables
		users to: (i) extract global and block-specific factors using a
		flexible multilevel factor structure; (ii) compute
		asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated
		factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings;
		(iii) estimate factor-augmented quantile regressions; (iv)
		recover full predictive densities from these quantile
		forecasts; and (v) estimate the density when the factors are
		stressed.
