		Factor-Augmented Regression Scenarios // Provides a comprehensive
		framework in R for modeling and forecasting economic scenarios
		based on multi-level dynamic factor model. The package enables
		users to: (i) extract global and group-specific factors using a
		flexible multi-level factor structure; (ii) compute
		asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated
		factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings;
		(iii) obtain estimates of the parameters of the factor-
		augmented quantile regressions together with their standard
		deviations; (iv) recover full predictive conditional densities
		from estimated quantiles; (v) obtain risk measures based on
		extreme quantiles of the conditional densities; (vi) estimate
		the conditional density and the corresponding extreme quantiles
		when the factors are stressed.
