		K Quantiles Medoids (KQM) Clustering // K Quantiles Medoids (KQM)
		clustering applies quantiles to divide data of each dimension
		into K mean intervals. Combining quantiles of all the
		dimensions of the data and fully permuting quantiles on each
		dimension is the strategy to determine a pool of candidate
		initial cluster centers. To find the best initial cluster
		centers from the pool of candidate initial cluster centers, two
		methods based on quantile strategy and PAM strategy
		respectively are proposed. During a clustering process, medoids
		of clusters are used to update cluster centers in each
		iteration. Comparison between KQM and the method of randomly
		selecting initial cluster centers shows that KQM is almost
		always getting clustering results with smaller total sum
		squares of distances.
