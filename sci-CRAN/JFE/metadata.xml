		A Menu-Driven GUI for Analyzing and Modelling Data of Just
		Finance and Econometrics // The Just Finance and Econometrics
		('JFE') provides a 'tcltk' based interface to global assets
		selection and portfolio optimization. 'JFE' aims to provide a
		simple GUI that allows a user to quickly load data from a
		.RData (.rda) file, explore the data and evaluate financial
		models. Invoked as JFE(), 'JFE' exports a number of utility
		functions for visualizing assets price (e.g. technical
		charting) and returns, selecting assets by performance index
		(based on the package 'PerformanceAnalytics') and backtesting
		specific portfolio profiles (based on the package
		'fPortfolio').
