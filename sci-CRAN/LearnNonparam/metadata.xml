		'R6'-Based Flexible Framework for Permutation Tests // Implements
		non-parametric tests from Higgins (2004, ISBN:0534387756),
		including tests for one sample, two samples, k samples, paired
		comparisons, blocked designs, trends and association. Built
		with 'Rcpp' for efficiency and 'R6' for flexible, object-
		oriented design, the package provides a unified framework for
		performing or creating custom permutation tests.
