		Adverse Event Enrichment Tests // We extend existing gene
		enrichment tests to perform adverse event enrichment analysis.
		Unlike the continuous gene expression data, adverse event data
		are counts. Therefore, adverse event data has many zeros and
		ties. We propose two enrichment tests. One is a modified
		Fisher's exact test based on pre-selected significant adverse
		events, while the other is based on a modified Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov statistic. We add Covariate adjustment to improve the
		analysis."Adverse event enrichment tests using VAERS" Shuoran
