		Add Josa Based on Previous Letter in Korean // Josa in Korean is
		often determined by judging the previous word. When writing
		reports using Rmd, a function that prints the appropriate
		investigation for each case is helpful. The 'josaplay' package
		then evaluates the previous word to determine which josa is
		appropriate.
