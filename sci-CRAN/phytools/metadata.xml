		Phylogenetic Tools for Comparative Biology (and Other Things) //
		A wide range of methods for phylogenetic analysis -
		concentrated in phylogenetic comparative biology, but also
		including numerous techniques for visualizing, analyzing,
		manipulating, reading or writing, and even inferring
		phylogenetic trees. Included among the functions in
		phylogenetic comparative biology are various for ancestral
		state reconstruction, model-fitting, and simulation of
		phylogenies and trait data. A broad range of plotting methods
		for phylogenies and comparative data include (but are not
		restricted to) methods for mapping trait evolution on trees,
		for projecting trees into phenotype space or a onto a
		geographic map, and for visualizing correlated speciation
		between trees. Lastly, numerous functions are designed for
		reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and
		manipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data. For
		instance, there are functions for computing consensus
		phylogenies from a set, for simulating phylogenetic trees and
		data under a range of models, for randomly or non-randomly
		attaching species or clades to a tree, as well as for a wide
		range of other manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic
		biologists might find useful in their research.
