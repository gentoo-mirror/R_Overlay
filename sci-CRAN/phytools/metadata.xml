		Phylogenetic Tools for Comparative Biology (and Other Things) //
		A wide range of functions for phylogenetic analysis -
		concentrated in phylogenetic comparative biology, but also
		including numerous methods for visualizing, manipulating,
		reading or writing, and even inferring phylogenetic trees.
		Included among the functions in phylogenetic comparative
		biology are various for ancestral state reconstruction, model-
		fitting, and simulation of phylogenies and data, for
		continuous, discrete, and multivariate characters. A broad
		range of plotting methods for phylogenies and comparative data
		include, but are not restricted to, methods for mapping trait
		evolution on trees, for projecting trees into phenotypic space
		or a geographic map, and for visualizing correlated speciation
		between trees. Finally, numerous functions are designed for
		reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and
		manipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data. For
		instance, there are functions for randomly or non-randomly
		attaching species or clades to a phylogeny, for computing
		consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating trees and
		phylogenetic data under a range of models, and for a wide
		variety of other manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic
		biologists might find useful in their research.
