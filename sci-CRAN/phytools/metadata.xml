		Phylogenetic Tools for Comparative Biology (and Other Things) //
		A wide range of functions for phylogenetic analysis.
		Functionality is concentrated in phylogenetic comparative
		biology, but also includes numerous methods for visualizing,
		manipulating, reading or writing, and even inferring
		phylogenetic trees. Included among the functions in
		phylogenetic comparative biology are various for ancestral
		state reconstruction, model-fitting, simulation of phylogenies
		and data, and multivariate analysis. There are a broad range of
		plotting methods for phylogenies and comparative data which
		include, but are not restricted to, methods for mapping trait
		evolution on trees, for projecting trees into phenotypic space
		or a geographic map, and for visualizing correlated speciation
		between trees. Finally, there are numerous functions for
		reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and
		manipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data not
		covered by other packages. For instance, there are functions
		for randomly or non-randomly attaching species or clades to a
		phylogeny, for computing consensus phylogenies from a set, for
		simulating trees and phylogenetic data under a range of models,
		and for a wide variety of other manipulations and analyses that
		phylogenetic biologists might find useful in their research.
