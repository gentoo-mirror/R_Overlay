		Wavelet Routines for Global and Local Multiple Regression and
		Correlation // Wavelet routines that calculate single sets of
		wavelet multiple regressions and correlations, and cross-
		regressions and cross-correlations from a multivariate time
		series.  Dynamic versions of the routines allow the wavelet
		local multiple (cross-)regressions and (cross-)correlations to
		evolve over time.
