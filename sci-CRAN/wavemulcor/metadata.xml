		Wavelet Routines for Global and Local Multiple Correlation //
		Wavelet routines that calculate single sets of wavelet multiple
		correlations (WMC) and cross-correlations (WMCC) out of n
		variables (either 1D time series, 2D images or 3D arrays). They
		can later be plotted in single graphs, as an alternative to
		trying to make sense out of several sets of wavelet
		correlations or wavelet cross-correlations. The code is based
		on the calculation, at each wavelet scale, of the square root
		of the coefficient of determination in a linear combination of
		variables for which such coefficient of determination is a
		maximum. The code provided here is based on the
		wave.correlation routine in Brandon Whitcher's waveslim R
		package Version: 1.6.4, which in turn is based on wavelet
		methodology developed in Percival and Walden (2000); Genay,
		Seluk and Whitcher (2001) and others. Version 2 incorporates
		wavelet local multiple correlations (WLMC). These are like the
		previous global WMC but consisting in one single set of
		multiscale correlations along time. That is, at each time t,
		they are calculated by letting a window of weighted wavelet
		coefficients around t move along time. Six weight functions are
		provided. Namely, the  uniform window, Cleveland's tricube
		window, Epanechnikov's parabolic window, Bartlett's triangular
		window and Wendland's truncated power window and the Gaussian
		window.
