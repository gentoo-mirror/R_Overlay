		Sample Size Calculator under Complex Survey Design // It helps in
		determination of sample size for estimating population mean or
		proportion under simple random sampling with or without
		replacement and stratified random sampling without replacement.
		When prior information on the population coefficient of
		variation (CV) is unavailable, then a preliminary sample is
		drawn to estimate the CV which is used to compute the final
		sample size. If the final size exceeds the preliminary sample
		size, then additional units are drawn; otherwise, the
		preliminary sample size is considered as final sample size. For
		stratified random sampling without replacement design, it also
		calculates the sample size in each stratum under different
		allocation methods for estimation of population mean and
		proportion based upon the availability of prior information on
		sizes of the strata, standard deviations of the strata and
		costs of drawing a sampling unit in the strata.For details on
		sampling methodology, see, Cochran (1977) "Sampling Techniques"
