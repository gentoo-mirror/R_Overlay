		A Fast 'ggplot2'-Based Implementation of Hilbert Curves // A set
		of functions that help to create plots based on Hilbert curves.
		Hilbert curves are used to map one dimensional data into the 2D
		plane. The package provides a function that generate a 2D
		coordinate from an integer position. As a specific use case the
		package provides a function that allows mapping a character
		column in a data frame into 2D space using 'ggplot2'. This
		allows visually comparing long lists of URLs, words, genes or
		other data that has a fixed order and position.
