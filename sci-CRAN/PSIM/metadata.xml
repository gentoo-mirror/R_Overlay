		Preference Selection Index Method (PSIM) // The Preference
		Selection Index Method was created in (2010) and provides an
		innovative approach to determining the relative importance of
		criteria without pairwise comparisons, unlike the Analytic
		Hierarchy Process. The Preference Selection Index Method uses
		statistical methods to calculate the criteria weights and
		reflects their relative importance in the final decision-making
		process, offering an objective and non-subjective solution.
		This method is beneficial in multi-criteria decision analysis.
		The 'PSIM' package provides a practical and accessible tool for
		implementing the Preference Selection Index Method in R. It
		calculates the weights of criteria and makes the method
		available to researchers, analysts, and professionals without
		the need to develop complex calculations manually. More details
		about the Preference Selection Index Method can be found in
		Maniya K. and Bhatt M. G.(2010)
