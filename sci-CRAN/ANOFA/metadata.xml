		Analyses of Frequency Data // Analyses of frequencies can be
		performed using an alternative test based on the G statistic.
		The test has similar type-I error rates and power as the chi-
		square test. However, it is based on a total statistic that can
		be decomposed in an additive fashion into interaction effects,
		main effects, simple effects, contrast effects, etc., mimicking
		precisely the logic of ANOVA. We call this set of tools 'ANOFA'
		(Analysis of Frequency data) to highlight its similarities with
		ANOVA. This framework also renders plots of frequencies along
		with confidence intervals. Finally, effect sizes and planning
		statistical power are easily done under this framework. The
		ANOFA is a tool that assesses the significance of effects
		instead of the significance of parameters; as such, it is more
		intuitive to most researchers than alternative approaches based
		on generalized linear models. See Laurencelle and Cousineau
