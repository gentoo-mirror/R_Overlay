		Multiple Administrations Adaptive Testing // Provides an
		extension of the shadow-test approach to computerized adaptive
		testing (CAT) implemented in the 'TestDesign' package for the
		assessment framework involving multiple tests administered
		periodically throughout the year. This framework is referred to
		as the Multiple Administrations Adaptive Testing (MAAT) and
		supports multiple item pools vertically scaled and multiple
		phases (stages) of CAT within each test. Between phases and
		tests, transitioning from one item pool (and associated
		constraints) to another is allowed as deemed necessary to
		enhance the quality of measurement.
