		Multivariate Surrogate Synchrony // Multivariate Surrogate
		Synchrony ('mvSUSY') estimates the synchrony within datasets
		that contain more than two time series. 'mvSUSY' was developed
		from Surrogate Synchrony ('SUSY') with respect to implementing
		surrogate controls, and extends synchrony estimation to
		multivariate data. 'mvSUSY' works as described in Meier
		Tschacher (2021).
