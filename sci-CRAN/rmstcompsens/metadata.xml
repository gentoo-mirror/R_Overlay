		Comparing Restricted Mean Survival Time as Sensitivity Analysis
		// Performs two-sample comparisons using the restricted mean
		survival time (RMST) when survival curves end at different time
		points between groups. This package implements a sensitivity
		approach that allows the threshold  timepoint tau to be
		specified after the longest survival time in the shorter
		survival group. Two kinds of between-group contrast estimators
		(the difference in RMST and the ratio of RMST) are computed:
