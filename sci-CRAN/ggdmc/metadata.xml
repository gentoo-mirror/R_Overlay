		Cognitive Models // Hierarchical Bayesian modelling. The 'ggdmc'
		package provides tools designed for fitting cognitive models,
		using population-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) and
		fast C++ libraries. The paper by Heathcote, Lin, Reynolds,
		Strickland, Gretton, and Matzke (2018,
		doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1067-y) describes the early prototype of
		the package (by the version 0.4.2). The paper accompanied with
		the revamped latest version ( 0.2.4.5) is under preparation
		Lin, Strickland, Reynold, and Heathcote (2018) and a further
		paper regarding the new pMCMC sampling modified based on Hu and
		Tsai's (2010) work is also under preparation. See
		'citation("ggdmc")' for details.
