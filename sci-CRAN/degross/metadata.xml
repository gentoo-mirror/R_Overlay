		Density Estimation from GROuped Summary Statistics // Estimation
		of a density from grouped (tabulated) summary statistics
		evaluated in each of the big bins (or classes) partitioning the
		support of the variable. These statistics include class
		frequencies and central moments of order one up to four. The
		log-density is modelled using a linear combination of penalised
		B-splines. The multinomial log-likelihood involving the
		frequencies adds up to a roughness penalty based on the
		differences in the coefficients of neighbouring B-splines and
		the log of a root-n approximation of the sampling density of
		the observed vector of central moments in each class. The so-
		obtained penalized log-likelihood is maximized using the EM
		algorithm to get an estimate of the spline parameters and,
		consequently, of the variable density and related quantities
		such as quantiles, see Lambert, P. (2021) arXiv:2107.03883 for
		details.
