		a Keep It Simple Species Migration Model // Simulating species
		migration and range dynamics under stable or changing
		environmental conditions based on a simple, raster-based,
		deterministic or stochastic migration model. KISSMig runs on
		binary or quantitative suitability maps, which are pre-
		calculated with niche-based habitat suitability models (also
		called ecological niche models (ENMs) or species distribution
		models (SDMs)). Nobis  Normand (2014), doi:10.1111/ecog.00930.
