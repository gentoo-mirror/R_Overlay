		Differential Coexpressed Networks // Estimation of DIFferential
		COexpressed NETworks using diverse and user metrics. This
		package is basically used for three functions related to the
		estimation of differential coexpression. First, to estimate
		differential coexpression where the coexpression is estimated,
		by default, by Spearman correlation. For this, a metric to
		compare two correlation distributions is needed. The package
		includes 6 metrics. Some of them needs a threshold. A new
		metric can also be specified as a user function with specific
		parameters (see difconet.run). The significance is be estimated
		by permutations. Second, to generate datasets with controlled
		differential correlation data. This is done by either adding
		noise, or adding specific correlation structure. Third, to show
		the results of differential correlation analyses. Please see
		http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx/difconet for further
		information.
