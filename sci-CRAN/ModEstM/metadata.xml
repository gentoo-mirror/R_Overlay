		Mode Estimation, Even in the Multimodal Case // Function
		ModEstM() is the only one of this package, it estimates the
		modes of an empirical univariate distribution. It relies on the
		stats::density() function, even for input control. Due to very
		good performance of the density estimation, computation time is
		not an issue. The multiple modes are handled using
		dplyr::group_by(). For conditions and rates of convergences,
		see Eddy (1980) doi:10.1214/aos/1176345080.
