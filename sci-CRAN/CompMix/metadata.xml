		A Comprehensive Toolkit for Environmental Mixtures Analysis
		('CompMix') // Quantitative characterization of the health
		impacts associated with exposure to chemical mixtures has
		received considerable attention in current environmental and
		epidemiological studies. 'CompMix' package allows practitioners
		to estimate the health impacts from exposure to chemical
		mixtures data through various statistical approaches, including
		Lasso, Elastic net, Bayeisan kernel machine regression (BKMR),
		hierNet, Quantile g-computation, Weighted quantile sum (WQS)
		and Random forest. Hao W, Cathey A, Aung M, Boss J, Meeker J,
		Mukherjee B. (2024) "Statistical methods for chemical mixtures:
		a practitioners guide". DOI:10.1101/2024.03.03.24303677.
