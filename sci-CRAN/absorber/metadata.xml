		Variable Selection in Nonparametric Models using B-Splines // A
		variable selection method using B-Splines in multivariate
		nOnparametric Regression models Based on partial dErivatives
		Regularization (ABSORBER) implements a novel variable selection
		method in a nonlinear multivariate model using B-splines. For
		further details we refer the reader to the paper Savino, M. E.
		and Lvy-Leduc, C. (2024), https://hal.science/hal-04434820.
