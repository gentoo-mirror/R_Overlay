		Estimation of Linear AR(1) Panel Data Models with Cross-Sectional
		Heteroskedasticity and/or Correlation // The package estimates
		linear models on panel data structures in the presence of
		AR(1)-type autocorrelation as well as panel heteroskedasticity
		and/or contemporaneous correlation. First, AR(1)-type
		autocorrelation is addressed via a two-step Prais-Winsten
		feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) procedure, where the
		autocorrelation coefficients may be panel-specific. A number of
		common estimators for the autocorrelation coefficient are
		supported. In case of panel heteroskedasticty, one can choose
		to use a sandwich-type robust standard error estimator with OLS
		or a panel weighted least squares estimator after the two-step
		Prais-Winsten estimator. Alternatively, if panels are both
		heteroskedastic and contemporaneously correlated, the package
		supports panel-corrected standard errors (PCSEs) as well as the
		Parks-Kmenta FGLS estimator.
