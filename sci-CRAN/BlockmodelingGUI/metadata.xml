		GUI for the Generalised Blockmodeling of Valued Networks // This
		app provides some useful tools for Offering an accessible GUI
		for generalised blockmodeling of single-relation, one-mode
		networks. The user can execute blockmodeling without having to
		write a line code by using the app's visual helps. Moreover,
		there are several ways to visualisations networks and their
		partitions. Finally, the results can be exported as if they
		were produced by writing code. The development of this package
		is financially supported by the Slovenian Research Agency
		(www.arrs.gov.si) within the research project J5-2557
		(Comparison and evaluation of different approaches to
		blockmodeling dynamic networks by simulations with application
		to Slovenian co-authorship networks).
