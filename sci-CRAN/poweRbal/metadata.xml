		Phylogenetic Tree Models and the Power of Tree Shape Statistics
		// The first goal of this package is to provide a multitude of
		tree models, i.e., functions that generate rooted binary trees
		with a given number of leaves. Second, the package allows for
		an easy evaluation and comparison of tree shape statistics by
		estimating their power to differentiate between different tree
		models. Please note that this R package was developed alongside
		the manuscript "Tree balance in phylogenetic models" by S. J.
		Kersting, K. Wicke, and M. Fischer (2024)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.05185, which provides further
		background and the respective mathematical definitions. This
		project was supported by the project ArtIGROW, which is a part
		of the WIR!-Alliance ArtIFARM   Artificial Intelligence in
		Farming funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and
		Research (No. 03WIR4805).
