		Genomic Mediation Analysis with Adaptive Confounding Adjustment
		// Performs genomic mediation analysis with adaptive
		confounding adjustment (GMAC) proposed by Yang et al. (2017)
		doi:10.1101/078683. It implements large scale mediation
		analysis and adaptively selects potential confounding variables
		to adjust for each mediation test from a pool of candidate
		confounders. The package is tailored for but not limited to
		genomic mediation analysis (e.g., cis-gene mediating trans-gene
		regulation pattern where an eQTL, its cis-linking gene
		transcript, and its trans-gene transcript play the roles as
		treatment, mediator and the outcome, respectively), restricting
		to scenarios with the presence of cis-association (i.e.,
		treatment-mediator association) and random eQTL (i.e.,
		treatment).
