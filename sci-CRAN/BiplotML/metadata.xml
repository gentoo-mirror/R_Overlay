		Biplots Estimation with Algorithms ML // Logistic Biplot is a
		method that allows representing multivariate binary data on a
		subspace of low dimension, where each individual is represented
		by a point and each variable as vectors directed through the
		origin. The orthogonal projection of individuals onto these
		vectors predicts the expected probability that the
		characteristic occurs. The package contains new techniques to
		estimate the model parameters and constructs in each case the
		'Logistic-Biplot'. References can be found in the help of each
		procedure.
