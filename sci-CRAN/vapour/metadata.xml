		Lightweight Access to the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library'
		('GDAL') // Provides low-level access to 'GDAL' functionality
		for R packages. The aim is to minimize the level of
		interpretation put on the 'GDAL' facilities, to enable direct
		use of it for a variety of purposes. 'GDAL' is the 'Geospatial
		Data Abstraction Library' a translator for raster and vector
		geospatial data formats that presents a single raster abstract
		data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling
		application for all supported formats https://gdal.org/. Other
		available packages 'rgdal' and 'sf' also provide access to the
		'GDAL' library, but neither can be used for these lower level
		tasks, and both do many other tasks.
