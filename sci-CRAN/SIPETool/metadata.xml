		SIFT-MS and CPET Data Processor // Processor for selected ion
		flow tube mass spectrometer (SIFT-MS) output file from breath
		analysis. It allows the filtering of the SIFT output file
		(i.e., variation over time of the target analyte concentration)
		and the following analysis for the determination of: maximum,
		average, and standard deviation value of target concentration
		measured at each exhalation, and the respiratory rate over the
		measurement. Additionally, it is possible to align the SIFT-MS
		data with other on-line techniques such as cardio pulmonary
		exercise test (CPET) for a comprehensive characterization of
		breath samples.
