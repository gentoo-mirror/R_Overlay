		An Analysis Toolbox for Hermitian Positive Definite Matrices //
		An implementation of data analysis tools for samples of
		symmetric or Hermitian positive definite matrices, such as
		collections of covariance matrices or spectral density
		matrices. The tools in this package can be used to perform (i)
		intrinsic manifold wavelet regression and clustering for curves
		(1D) or surfaces (2D) of Hermitian positive definite matrices,
		and (ii) exploratory data analysis and inference for samples of
		(curves of) Hermitian positive definite matrices by means of
		intrinsic manifold data depth and manifold rank-based
		hypothesis tests.
