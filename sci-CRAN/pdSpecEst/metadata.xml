		An Analysis Toolbox for Hermitian Positive Definite Matrices //
		An implementation of data analysis tools for samples of
		symmetric or Hermitian positive definite matrices, such as
		collections of covariance matrices or spectral density
		matrices. The tools in this package can be used to perform: (i)
		intrinsic wavelet transforms for curves (1D) or surfaces (2D)
		of Hermitian positive definite matrices with applications to
		dimension reduction, denoising and clustering in the space of
		Hermitian positive definite matrices; and (ii) exploratory data
		analysis and inference for samples of positive definite
		matrices by means of intrinsic data depth functions and rank-
		based hypothesis tests in the space of Hermitian positive
		definite matrices.
