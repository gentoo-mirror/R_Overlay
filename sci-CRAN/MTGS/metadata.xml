		Genomic Selection using Multiple Traits // Genomic selection (GS)
		is recent development in animal and plant breeding. In GS whole
		genome markers information is used to predict genetic merit of
		an individual. This package is basically developed for genomic
		predictions by estimating marker effects. These marker effects
		are then further used for calculation of genotypic merit of
		individual i.e. genome estimated breeding values (GEBVs).
		However, as genetic correlations between quantitative traits
		under breeding studies are obvious. These correlations indicate
		that one trait carry information over other traits. Current,
		single-trait genomic selection (STGS) methods could not able to
		utilize this information. Genomic selection based on multiple
		traits (MTGS) could be a better alternative to STGS. This
		package performs genomic selection using multi traits
		information hence named as MTGS i.e. multi trait genomic
		selection. MTGS is a comprehensive package which gives single
		step solution for genomic selection using various MTGS based
		methods.
