		Extension Types for Spatial Data for Use with 'Arrow' // Provides
		extension types and conversions to between R-native object
		types and 'Arrow' columnar types. This includes integration
		among the 'arrow', 'nanoarrow', 'sf', and 'wk' packages such
		that spatial metadata is preserved wherever possible. Extension
		type implementations ensure first-class geometry data type
		support in the 'arrow' and 'nanoarrow' packages.
