		Tools to Merge Hardware Event Monitors (HEMs) Coming from
		Separate Subexperiments into One Single Dataframe //
		Implementation of two tools to merge Hardware Event Monitors
		(HEMs) from different subexperiments. Hardware Reading and
		Merging (HRM), which uses order statistics to merge; and MUlti-
		Correlation HEM (MUCH) which merges using a multivariate normal
		distribution. The reference paper for HRM is: S. Vilardell, I.
		Serra, R. Santalla, E. Mezzetti, J. Abella and F. J. Cazorla,
		"HRM: Merging Hardware Event Monitors for Improved Timing
		Analysis of Complex MPSoCs," in IEEE Transactions on Computer-
		Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, vol. 39, no.
		11, pp. 3662-3673, Nov. 2020, doi:10.1109/TCAD.2020.3013051.
		For MUCH: S. Vilardell, I. Serra, E. Mezzetti, J. Abella, and
		F. J. Cazorla. 2021. "MUCH: exploiting pairwise hardware event
		monitor correlations for improved timing analysis of complex
		MPSoCs". In Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on
		Applied Computing (SAC '21). Association for Computing
		Machinery. doi:10.1145/3412841.3441931. This work has been
