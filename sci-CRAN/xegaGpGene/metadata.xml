		Genetic Operations for Grammar-Based Genetic Programming // An
		implementation of the representation-dependent gene level
		operations of grammar-based genetic programming with genes
		which are derivation trees of a context-free grammar:
		Initialization of a gene with a complete random derivation
		tree, decoding of a derivation tree. Crossover is implemented
		by exchanging subtrees. Depth-bounds for the minimal and the
		maximal depth of the roots of the subtrees exchanged by
		crossover can be set. Mutation is implemented by replacing a
		subtree by a random subtree. The depth of the random subtree
		and the insertion node are configurable. For details, see
		Geyer-Schulz (1997, ISBN:978-3-7908-0830-X).
