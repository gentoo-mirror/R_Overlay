		Macroeconomic-at-Risk // The Macroeconomics-at-Risk (MaR)
		approach is based on a two-step semi-parametric estimation
		procedure that allows to forecast the full conditional
		distribution of an economic variable at a given horizon, as a
		function of a set of factors. These density forecasts are then
		be used to produce coherent forecasts for any downside risk
		measure, e.g., value-at-risk, expected shortfall, downside
		entropy. Initially introduced by Adrian et al. (2019)
		doi:10.1257/aer.20161923 to reveal the vulnerability of
		economic growth to financial conditions, the MaR approach is
		currently extensively used by international financial
		institutions to provide Value-at-Risk (VaR) type forecasts for
		GDP growth (Growth-at-Risk) or inflation (Inflation-at-Risk).
		This package provides methods for estimating these models.
		Datasets for the US and the Eurozone are available to allow
		testing of the Adrian et al (2019) model. This package
		constitutes a useful toolbox (data and functions) for private
		practitioners, scholars as well as policymakers.
