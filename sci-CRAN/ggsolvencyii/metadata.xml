		A 'ggplot2'-Plot of Composition of Solvency II SCR: SF and IM //
		An implementation of 'ggplot2'-methods to present the
		composition of Solvency II Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)
		as a series of concentric circle-parts. Solvency II (Solvency
		2) is European insurance legislation, coming in force by the
		delegated acts of October 10, 2014. https://eur-
		lex.europa.eu/legal-
		content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2015%3A012%3ATOC. Additional
		files, defining the structure of the Standard Formula (SF)
		method of the SCR-calculation are provided. The structure files
		can be adopted for localization or for insurance companies who
		use Internal Models (IM). Options are available for combining
		smaller components, horizontal and vertical scaling, rotation,
		and plotting only some circle-parts. With outlines and
		connectors several SCR-compositions can be compared, for
		example in ORSA-scenarios (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment).
