		Anomaly Detection in High Dimensional and Temporal Data // This
		is a modification of 'HDoutliers' package. The 'HDoutliers'
		algorithm is a powerful unsupervised algorithm for detecting
		anomalies in high-dimensional data, with a strong theoretical
		foundation. However, it suffers from some limitations that
		significantly hinder its performance level, under certain
		circumstances. This package implements the algorithm proposed
		in Talagala, Hyndman and Smith-Miles (2019) arXiv:1908.04000
		for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data that addresses
		these limitations of 'HDoutliers' algorithm. We define an
		anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly from the
		majority with a large distance gap. An approach based on
		extreme value theory is used for the anomalous threshold
		calculation.
