		Moments of Folded and Doubly Truncated Multivariate Distributions
		// It computes arbitrary products moments (mean vector and
		variance-covariance matrix), for some double truncated (and
		folded) multivariate distributions. These distributions belong
		to the family of selection elliptical distributions, which
		includes well known skewed distributions as the unified skew-t
		distribution (SUT) and its particular cases as the extended
		skew-t (EST), skew-t (ST) and the symmetric student-t (T)
		distribution. Analogous normal cases unified skew-normal (SUN),
		extended skew-normal (ESN), skew-normal (SN), and symmetric
		normal (N) are also included. Density, probabilities and random
		deviates are also offered for these members.
