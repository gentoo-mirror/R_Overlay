		Moments of Folded and Doubly Truncated Multivariate Distributions
		// It computes the raw moments for the folded and truncated
		multivariate normal and Student's t-distribution. It also
		offers specific functions to compute the mean and variance-
		covariance matrix as well as the cumulative distribution
		function (cdf) for the folded normal and folded t-distribution.
		Algorithms are extensions based on Kan, R.,  Robotti, C. (2017)
