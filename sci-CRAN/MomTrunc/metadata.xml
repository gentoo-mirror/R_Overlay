		Moments of Folded and Doubly Truncated Multivariate Distributions
		// It computes the raw moments for the truncated and folded
		multivariate normal, Skew-normal (SN), Extended skew normal
		(ESN) and Student's t-distribution. It also offers specific
		functions to compute the mean and variance-covariance matrix as
		well as the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the
		folded normal, SN, ESN, and folded t-distribution. Density and
		random deviates are offered for the ESN (SN as particular case)
		distribution. Most algorithms are extensions based on Kan, R.,
