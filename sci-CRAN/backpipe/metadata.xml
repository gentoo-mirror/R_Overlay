		Backward Pipe (Right-to-Left) Operator // Provides a backward-
		pipe operator for 'magrittr' (%%) or 'pipeR' (%%) that allows
		for a performing operations from right-to-left. This allows
		writing more legible code where right-to-left ordering is
		natural. This is common with hierarchies and nested structures
		such as trees, directories or markup languages (e.g. HTML and
		XML). The package also includes a R-Studio add-in that can be
		bound to a keyboard shortcut.
