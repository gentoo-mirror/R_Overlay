		Fast Time Series Modeling with the Sparsity Ranked Lasso // An
		implementation of sparsity-ranked lasso and related methods for
		time series data. This methodology is especially useful for
		large time series with exogenous features and/or complex
		seasonality. Originally described in Peterson and Cavanaugh
		(2022) doi:10.1007/s10182-021-00431-7 in the context of
		variable selection with interactions and/or polynomials, ranked
		sparsity is a philosophy with methods useful for variable
		selection in the presence of prior informational asymmetry.
		This situation exists for time series data with complex
		seasonality, as shown in Peterson and Cavanaugh (2023+)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.01492, which also describes this
		package in greater detail. The sparsity-ranked methods for Time
		Series implemented in 'fastTS' can fit large/complex/high-
		frequency time series quickly, even with a high-dimensional
		exogenous feature set. The method is considerably faster than
		its competitors, while often producing more accurate
		predictions. Also included is a long hourly series of arrivals
		into the University of Iowa Emergency Department with
		concurrent local temperature.
