		Fast Time Series Modeling for Seasonal Series with Exogenous
		Variables // An implementation of sparsity-ranked lasso and
		related methods for time series data. This methodology is
		especially useful for large time series with exogenous features
		and/or complex seasonality. Originally described in Peterson
		and Cavanaugh (2022) doi:10.1007/s10182-021-00431-7 in the
		context of variable selection with interactions and/or
		polynomials, ranked sparsity is a philosophy with methods
		useful for variable selection in the presence of prior
		informational asymmetry. This situation exists for time series
		data with complex seasonality, as shown in Peterson and
		Cavanaugh (2024) doi:10.1177/1471082X231225307, which also
		describes this package in greater detail. The sparsity-ranked
		penalization methods for time series implemented in 'fastTS'
		can fit large/complex/high-frequency time series quickly, even
		with a high-dimensional exogenous feature set. The method is
		considerably faster than its competitors, while often producing
		more accurate predictions. Also included is a long hourly
		series of arrivals into the University of Iowa Emergency
		Department with concurrent local temperature.
