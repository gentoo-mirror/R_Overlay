		Ensemble Quadratic and Affine Invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo
		// The Ensemble Quadratic and Affine Invariant Markov chain
		Monte Carlo algorithms provide an efficient way to perform
		Bayesian inference in difficult parameter space geometries. The
		Ensemble Quadratic Monte Carlo algorithm was developed by
		Militzer (2023) doi:10.3847/1538-4357/ace1f1. The Ensemble
		Affine Invariant algorithm was developed by Goodman and Weare
		(2010) doi:10.2140/camcos.2010.5.65 and it was implemented in
		Python by Foreman-Mackey et al (2013)
		doi:10.48550/arXiv.1202.3665. The Quadratic Monte Carlo method
		was shown to perform better than the Affine Invariant method in
		the paper by Militzer (2023) doi:10.3847/1538-4357/ace1f1 and
		the Quadratic Monte Carlo method is the default method used.
		The Chen-Shao Highest Posterior Density Estimation algorithm is
		used for obtaining credible intervals and the potential scale
		reduction factor diagnostic is used for checking the
		convergence of the chains.
