		Network Diffusion Algorithms // Implementation of network
		diffusion algorithms such as insulated heat propagation or
		Markov random walks. Network diffusion algorithms generally
		spread information in the form of node weights along the edges
		of a graph to other nodes. These weights can for example be
		interpreted as temperature, an initial amount of water, the
		activation of neurons in the brain, or the location of a random
		surfer in the internet. The information (node weights) is
		iteratively propagated to other nodes until a equilibrium state
		or stop criterion occurs.
