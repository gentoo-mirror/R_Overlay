		Landscape Construction and Simulation for Ising Networks // A
		toolbox for constructing potential landscapes for Ising
		networks. The parameters of the networks can be directly
		supplied by users or estimated by the 'IsingFit' package by van
		Borkulo and Epskamp (2016)
		https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IsingFit from empirical
		data. The Ising model's Boltzmann distribution is preserved for
		the potential landscape function. The landscape functions can
		be used for quantifying and visualizing the stability of
		network states, as well as visualizing the simulation process.
