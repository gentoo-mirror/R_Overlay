		A Performance-Focused Package for Clinical Trial Tables // Create
		high-performance clinical reporting tables (TLGs) from ADaM-
		like inputs. The package provides a consistent, programmatic
		API to generate common tables such as demographics, adverse
		event incidence, and laboratory summaries, using 'data.table'
		for fast aggregation over large populations. Functions support
		flexible target-variable selection, stratification by
		treatment, and customizable summary statistics, and return
		tidy, machine-readable results ready to render with downstream
		table/formatting packages in analysis pipelines.
