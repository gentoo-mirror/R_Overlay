		Change Metrics for Species Geographic Ranges // Facilitates
		workflows to reproducibly transform estimates of species
		distributions into metrics relevant for conservation. For
		example, combining predictions from species distribution models
		with other maps of environmental data to characterize the
		proportion of a species range that is under protection,
		calculating metrics used under the International Union for
		Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Criteria A and B guidelines (Area
		of Occupancy and Extent of Occurrence), and calculating more
		general metrics such as taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity,
		as well as endemism. Also facilitates temporal comparisons
		among biodiversity metrics to inform efforts towards
		complementarity and consideration of future scenarios in
		conservation decisions. 'changeRangeR' also provides tools to
		determine the effects of modeling decisions through sensitivity
		tests.
