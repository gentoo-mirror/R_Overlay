		Pedigree functions // Routines to handle family data with a
		pedigree object. The initial purpose was to create correlation
		structures that describe family relationships such as kinship
		and identity-by-descent, which can be used to model family data
		in mixed effects models, such as in the coxme function.  Also
		includes a tool for pedigree drawing which is focused on
		producing compact layouts without intervention.  Recent
		additions include utilities to trim the pedigree object with
		various criteria, and kinship for the X chromosome
