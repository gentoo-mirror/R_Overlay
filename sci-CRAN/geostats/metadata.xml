		An Introduction to Statistics for Geoscientists // A collection
		of datasets and simplified functions for an introductory
		(geo)statistics module at University College London. Provides
		functionality for compositional, directional and spatial data,
		including ternary diagrams, Wulff and Schmidt stereonets, and
		ordinary kriging interpolation. Implements logistic and
		(additive and centred) logratio transformations. Computes
		vector averages and concentration parameters for the von-Mises
		distribution. Includes a collection of natural and synthetic
		fractals, and a simulator for deterministic chaos using a
		magnetic pendulum example. The main purpose of these functions
		is pedagogical. Researchers can find more complete alternatives
		for these tools in other packages such as 'compositions',
		'robCompositions', 'sp', 'gstat' and 'RFOC'. All the functions
		are written in plain R, with no compiled code and a minimal
		number of dependencies. Theoretical background and worked
		examples are available at https://tinyurl.com/UCLgeostats/.
