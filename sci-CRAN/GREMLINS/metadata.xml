		Generalized Multipartite Networks // We define generalized
		multipartite networks  as the joint observation of several
		networks implying some common pre-specified groups of
		individuals. The aim is to fit an adapted version of  the
		popular stochastic block model to multipartite networks, as
		described in Bar-hen, Barbillon and Donnet (2020)
		arXiv:1807.10138.
