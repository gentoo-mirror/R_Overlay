		Screened Selection Design with Binary Endpoints // A study based
		on the screened selection design (SSD) is an exploratory phase
		II randomized trial with two or more arms but without
		concurrent control. The primary aim of the SSD trial is to pick
		a desirable treatment arm (e.g., in terms of the response rate)
		to recommend to the subsequent randomized phase IIb (with the
		concurrent control) or phase III. The proposed designs can
		partially control or provide the empirical type I error/false
		positive rate by an optimal algorithm (implemented by the
		optimal_2arm_binary() or optimal_3arm_binary() function) for
		each arm. All the design needed components (sample size,
		operating characteristics) are supported.
