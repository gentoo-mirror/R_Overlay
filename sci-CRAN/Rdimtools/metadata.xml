		Dimension Reduction and Estimation Methods // We provide a rich
		collection of linear and nonlinear dimension reduction
		techniques implemented using 'RcppArmadillo'. The question on
		what we should use as the target dimension is addressed by
		intrinsic dimension estimation methods introduced as well. For
		more details on dimensionality techniques, see the paper by Ma
		and Zhu (2013) doi:10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00182.x if you are
		interested in statistical approach, or Engel, Huttenberger, and
		Hamann (2012) doi:10.4230/OASIcs.VLUDS.2011.135 for a broader
		cross-disciplinary overview.
