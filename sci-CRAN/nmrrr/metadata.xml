		Binning and Visualizing NMR Spectra in Environmental Samples // A
		reproducible workflow for binning and visualizing NMR (nuclear
		magnetic resonance) spectra from environmental samples. The
		'nmrrr' package is intended for post-processing of NMR data,
		including importing, merging and, cleaning data from multiple
		files, visualizing NMR spectra, performing binning/integrations
		for compound classes, and relative abundance calculations. This
		package can be easily inserted into existing analysis workflows
		by users to help with analyzing and interpreting NMR data.
