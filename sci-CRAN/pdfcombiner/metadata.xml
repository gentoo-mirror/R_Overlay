		Graphical User Interface for Manipulating PDF and Image Files //
		A 'shiny' app that supports merging of PDF and/or image files
		with page selection, removal, or rotation options. It is a
		fast, free, and secure alternative to commercial software or
		various online websites which require users to sign-up, and it
		avoids any potential risks associated with uploading files
		elsewhere.
