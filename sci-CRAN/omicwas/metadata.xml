		Cell-Type-Specific Association Testing in Bulk Omics Experiments
		// In bulk epigenome/transcriptome experiments, molecular
		expression is measured in a tissue, which is a mixture of
		multiple types of cells. This package tests association of a
		disease/phenotype with a molecular marker for each cell type.
		The proportion of cell types in each sample needs to be given
		as input. The package is applicable to epigenome-wide
		association study (EWAS) of microarray experiments. Takeuchi
		and Kato (submitted) "omicwas: cell-type-specific epigenome-
		wide and transcriptome association study".
