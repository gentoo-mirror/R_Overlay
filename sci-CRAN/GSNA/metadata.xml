		Gene Set Networking Analysis Package // Create networks of gene
		sets, infer clusters of functionally-related gene sets based on
		similarity statistics, and visualize the results. This package
		simplifies and accelerates interpretation of pathways analysis
		data sets. It is designed to work in tandem with standard
		pathways analysis methods, such as the 'GSEA' program (Gene Set
		Enrichment Analysis), CERNO (Coincident Extreme Ranks in
		Numerical Observations, implemented in the 'tmod' package) and
		others. Inputs to 'GSNA' are the outputs of pathways analysis
		methods: a list of gene sets (or "modules"), pathways or GO-
		terms with associated p-values. Since pathways analysis methods
		may be used to analyze many different types of data including
		transcriptomic, epigenetic, and high-throughput screen data
		sets, the 'GSNA' pipeline is applicable to these data as well.
		The use of 'GSNA' has been described in the following papers:
