		Partial Autoregression // A time series is said to be partially
		autoregressive if it can be represented as a sum of a random
		walk and an autoregressive sequence without unit roots. This
		package fits partially autoregressive time series, where the
		autoregressive  component is AR(1).  This may be of use in
		modeling certain financial time series.
