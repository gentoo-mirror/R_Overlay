		Multi-Calibration Boosting // Implements 'Multi-Calibration
		Boosting' (2018) https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/hebert-
		johnson18a.html and 'Multi-Accuracy Boosting' (2019)
		arXiv:1805.12317 for the multi-calibration of a machine
		learning model's prediction. 'MCBoost' updates predictions for
		sub-groups in an iterative fashion in order to mitigate biases
		like poor calibration or large accuracy differences across
		subgroups. Multi-Calibration works best in scenarios where the
		underlying data  labels are unbiased, but resulting models are.
		This is often the case, e.g. when an algorithm fits a majority
		population while ignoring or under-fitting minority
		populations.
