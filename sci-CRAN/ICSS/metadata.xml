		ICSS Algorithm by Inclan/Tiao (1994) // The Iterative Cumulative
		Sum of Squares (ICSS) algorithm by Inclan/Tiao (1994)
		https://www.jstor.org/stable/2290916 detects multiple change
		points, i.e. structural break points, in the variance of a
		sequence of independent observations. For series of moderate
		size (i.e. 200 observations and beyond), the ICSS algorithm
		offers results comparable to those obtained by a Bayesian
		approach or by likelihood ration tests, without the heavy
		computational burden required by these approaches.
