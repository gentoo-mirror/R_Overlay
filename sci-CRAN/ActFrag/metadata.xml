		Activity Fragmentation Metrics Extracted from Minute Level
		Activity Data // Recent studies haven shown that, on top of
		total daily active/sedentary volumes, the time accumulation
		strategies provide more sensitive information. This package
		provides functions to extract commonly used fragmentation
		metrics to quantify such time accumulation strategies based on
		minute level actigraphy-measured activity counts data.
