		Efficient Savitzky-Golay Filtering // Smoothing signals and
		computing their derivatives is a common requirement in signal
		processing workflows. Savitzky-Golay filters are a established
		method able to do both (Savitzky and Golay, 1964
		doi:10.1021/ac60214a047). This package implements one
		dimensional Savitzky-Golay filters that can be applied to
		vectors and matrices (either row-wise or column-wise).
		Vectorization and memory allocations have been profiled to
		reduce computational fingerprint. Short filter lengths are
		implemented in the direct space, while longer filters are
		implemented in frequency space, using a Fast Fourier Transform
		(FFT).
