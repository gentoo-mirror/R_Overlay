		Robust Change-Point Tests // Provides robust methods to detect
		change-points in uni- or multivariate time series. They can
		cope with corrupted data and heavy tails. Focus is on the
		detection of abrupt changes in location, but changes scale or
		dependence structure can be detected as well. This package
		provides tests for change detection in uni- and multivariate
		time series based on Huberized versions of CUSUM tests proposed
		in Duerre and Fried (2019) arXiv:1905.06201. Furthermore, robcp
		provides tests for change detection in univariate time series
		based on 2-sample U-statistics or 2-sample U-quantiles as
		proposed by Dehling et al. (2015)
