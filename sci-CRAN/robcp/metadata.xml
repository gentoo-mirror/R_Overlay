		Robust Change-Point Tests // Provides robust methods to detect
		change-points in uni- or multivariate time series. They can
		cope with corrupted data and heavy tails. Focus is on the
		detection of abrupt changes in location, but changes in the
		scale or dependence structure can be detected as well. This
		package provides tests for change detection in uni- and
		multivariate time series based on Huberized versions of CUSUM
		tests proposed in Duerre and Fried (2019)
		DOI:10.48550/arXiv.1905.06201, and tests for change detection
		in univariate time series based on 2-sample U-statistics or
		2-sample U-quantiles as proposed by Dehling et al. (2015)
		DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-3076-0_12 and Dehling, Fried and Wendler
		(2020) DOI:10.1093/biomet/asaa004. Furthermore, the packages
		provides tests on changes in the scale or the correlation as
		proposed in Gerstenberger, Vogel and Wendler (2020)
