		Robust Change-Point Tests // Provides robust methods to detect
		change-points in uni- or multivariate time series. They can
		cope with corrupted data and heavy tails. One can detect
		changes in location, scale and dependence structure of a
		possibly multivariate time series. Procedures are based on
		Huberized versions of CUSUM tests proposed in Duerre and Fried
		(2019) arXiv:1905.06201.
