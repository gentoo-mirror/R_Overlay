		Access and Manipulate Amiga Disk Files // Amiga Disk Files (ADF)
		are virtual representations of 3.5 inch floppy disks for the
		Commodore Amiga. Most disk drives from other systems (including
		modern drives) are not able to read these disks. The
		'adfExplorer' package enables you to establish R connections to
		files on such virtual DOS-formatted disks, which can be use to
		read from and write to those files.
