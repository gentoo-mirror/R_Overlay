		Import from and Export to Amiga Disk Files // Amiga Disk Files
		(ADF) are virtual representations of 3.5 inch floppy disks for
		the Commodore Amiga. Most disk drives from other systems
		(including modern drives) are not able to read these disks. To
		be able to emulate this system, the ADF format was created.
		This package enables you to read ADF files and import and
		export files from and to such virtual DOS-formatted disks.
