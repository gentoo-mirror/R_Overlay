		Manipulate and Play 'ProTracker' Modules // 'ProTracker' is a
		popular music tracker to sequence music on a Commodore Amiga
		machine. This package offers the opportunity to import, export,
		manipulate and play 'ProTracker' module files. Even though the
		file format could be considered archaic, it still remains
		popular to this date. This package intends to contribute to
		this popularity and therewith keeping the legacy of
		'ProTracker' and the Commodore Amiga alive. This package is the
		successor of 'ProTrackR' providing better performance.
