		Modeling Time-to-Event Data with Functional Predictors // A
		collection of methods for modeling time-to-event data using
		both functional and scalar predictors. It implements functional
		data analysis techniques for estimation and inference, allowing
		researchers to assess the impact of functional covariates on
		survival outcomes, including time-to-single event and recurrent
		event outcomes.
