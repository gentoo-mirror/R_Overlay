		Weighted Win Loss Statistics and their Variances // Calculate the
		(weighted) win loss statistics including the win ratio, win
		difference and win product and their variances, with which the
		p-values are also calculated. The variance estimation is based
		on Luo et al. (2015) doi:10.1111/biom.12225 and Luo et al.
		(2017) doi:10.1002/sim.7284. This package also calculates
		general win loss statistics with user-specified win loss
		function with variance estimation based on Bebu and Lachin
		(2016) doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv032.
