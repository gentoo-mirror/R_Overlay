		Ranked Set Sampling // Ranked set sampling (RSS) is introduced as
		an advanced method for data collection which is substantial for
		the statistical and methodological analysis in scientific
		studies by McIntyre (1952) (reprinted in 2005)
		doi:10.1198/000313005X54180. This package introduces the first
		package  that implements the RSS and its modified versions for
		sampling. With 'RSSampling', the researchers can sample with
		basic RSS and the modified versions, namely, Median RSS,
		Extreme RSS, Percentile RSS, Balanced groups RSS, Double RSS,
		L-RSS, Truncation-based RSS, Robust extreme RSS. The
		'RSSampling' also allows imperfect ranking using an auxiliary
		variable (concomitant) which is widely used in the real life
		applications. Applicants can also use this package for
		parametric and nonparametric inference such as mean, median and
		variance estimation, regression analysis and some distribution-
		free tests where the the samples are obtained via basic RSS.
