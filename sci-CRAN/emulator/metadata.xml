		Bayesian Emulation of Computer Programs // Allows one to estimate
		the output of a computer program, as a function of the input
		parameters, without actually running it. The computer program
		is assumed to be a Gaussian process, whose parameters are
		estimated using Bayesian techniques that give a PDF of expected
		program output.  This PDF is conditional on a training set of
		runs, each consisting of a point in parameter space and the
		model output at that point.  The emphasis is on complex codes
		that take weeks or months to run, and that have a large number
		of undetermined input parameters; many climate prediction
		models fall into this class.  The emulator essentially
		determines Bayesian posterior estimates of the PDF of the
		output of a model, conditioned on results from previous runs
		and a user-specified prior linear model.  A vignette is
		provided and the help pages include examples.
