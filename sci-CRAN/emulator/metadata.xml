		Bayesian emulation of computer programs // This package allows
		one to estimate the output of a computer program, as a function
		of the input parameters, without actually running it. The
		computer program is assumed to be a Gaussian process, whose
		parameters are estimated using Bayesian techniques that give a
		PDF of expected program output.  This PDF is conditional on a
		``training set'' of runs, each consisting of a point in
		parameter space and the model output at that point.  The
		emphasis is on complex codes that take weeks or months to run,
		and that have a large number of undetermined input parameters;
		many climate prediction models fall into this class.  The
		emulator essentially determines Bayesian posterior estimates of
		the PDF of the output of a model, conditioned on results from
		previous runs and a user-specified prior linear model.  A
		working example is given in the help page for function
		`interpolant()', which should be the first point of reference.
