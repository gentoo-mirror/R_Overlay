		An R Wrapper of the 'Inform' C Library for Information Analysis
		of Complex Systems // An R wrapper of the 'Inform' v1.0.0 C
		library for performing information analysis of complex systems.
		As for the 'Inform' library, 'rinform' is structured around the
		concepts of: 1) discrete empirical probability distributions,
		which form the basis for all of the information-theoretic
		measures; 2) classic information-theoretic measures built upon
		empirical distributions; and 3) measures of information
		dynamics for time series. In addition to the core components,
		'rinform' also provides a collection of utilities to manipulate
		time series.
