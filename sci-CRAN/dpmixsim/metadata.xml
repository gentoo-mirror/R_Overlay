		Dirichlet Process Mixture Model Simulation for Clustering and
		Image Segmentation // The 'dpmixsim' package implements a
		Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model for clustering and image
		segmentation.  The DPM model is a Bayesian nonparametric
		methodology that relies on MCMC simulations for exploring
		mixture models with an unknown number of components.  The code
		implements conjugate models with normal structure (conjugate
		normal-normal DP mixture model). The package's applications are
		oriented towards the classification of magnetic resonance
		images according to tissue type or region of interest.
