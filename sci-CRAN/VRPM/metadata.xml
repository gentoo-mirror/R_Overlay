		Visualizing Risk Prediction Models // This is a package to
		visualize risk prediction models. For each predictor, a color
		bar represents the contribution to the linear predictor or
		latent variable. A conversion from the linear predictor to the
		estimated risk or survival is also given. (Cumulative)
		contribution charts enable to visualize how the estimated risk
		for one particular observation is obtained by the model.
		Several options allow to choose different color maps, and to
		select the zero level of the contributions. The package is able
		to deal with 'glm', 'coxph', 'mfp', 'multinom' and 'ksvm'
		objects. For 'ksvm' objects, the visualization is not always
		exact. Functions providing tools to indicate the accuracy of
		the approximation are provided in addition to the
		visualization.
