		Generation of Spatial Data with Spatially Varying Model Parameter
		// A spatial population can be generated based on spatially
		varying regression model under the assumption that observations
		are collected from a uniform two-dimensional grid consist of (m
		* m) lattice points with unit distance between any two
		neighbouring points. For method details see Chao, Liu.,
		Chuanhua, Wei. and Yunan, Su.
		(2018).DOI:10.1080/10485252.2018.1499907.  This spatially
		generated data can be used to test different issues related to
		the statistical analysis of spatial data. This generated
		spatial data can be utilized in geographically weighted
		regression analysis for studying the spatially varying
		relationships among the variables.
