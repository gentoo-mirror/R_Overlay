		Quality-of-Life Solver for "Measuring Quality of Life under
		Spatial Frictions" // This toolkit implements a numerical
		solution algorithm to invert a quality of life measure from
		observed data. Unlike the traditional Rosen-Roback measure,
		this measure accounts for mobility frictionsgenerated by
		idiosyncratic tastes and local ties  and trade frictions
		generated by trade costs and non-tradable services, thereby
		reducing non-classical measurement error. The QoL measure is
		based on Ahlfeldt, Bald, Roth, Seidel (2024)

		"Measuring Quality of Life under Spatial Frictions". When using
		this programme or the toolkit in your work, please cite the
		paper.
