		Computational Prediction of Proteins Encoded by Circadian Genes
		// A computational model for predicting proteins encoded by
		circadian genes. The support vector machine has been employed
		with Laplace kernel for prediction of circadian proteins, where
		compositional, transitional and physico-chemical features were
		utilized as numeric features. User can predict for the test
		dataset using the proposed computational model. Besides, the
		user can also build their own training model using their
		training dataset, followed by prediction for the test set.
