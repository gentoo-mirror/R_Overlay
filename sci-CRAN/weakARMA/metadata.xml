		Tools for the Analysis of Weak ARMA Models // Numerous time
		series admit autoregressive moving average (ARMA)
		representations, in which the errors are uncorrelated but not
		necessarily independent. These models are called weak ARMA by
		opposition to the standard ARMA models, also called strong ARMA
		models, in which the error terms are supposed to be independent
		and identically distributed (iid). This package allows the
		study of nonlinear time series models through weak ARMA
		representations. It determines identification, estimation and
		validation for ARMA models and for AR and MA models in
		particular. Functions can also be used in the strong case. This
		package also works on white noises by omitting arguments 'p',
		'q', 'ar' and 'ma'. See Francq, C. and Zakoan, J. (1998)

		and Saussereau, B. (2018) doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1380030 for
		more details.
