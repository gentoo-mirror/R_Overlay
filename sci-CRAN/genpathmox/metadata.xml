		Generalized Pathmox Approach Segmentation Tree Analysis //
		Provides a very interesting solution for handling segmentation
		variables in complex statistical methodology. It contains en
		extended version of the "Pathmox" algorithm (Lamberti, Sanchez
		and Aluja,(2016)doi:10.1002/asmb.2168) in the context of
		Partial Least Squares Path Modeling including the F-block test
		(to detect the responsible latent endogenous equations of the
		difference), the F-coefficient (to detect the path coefficients
		responsible of the difference) and the "invariance" test (to
		realize a comparison between the sub-models' latent variables).
		Furthermore, the package contains a generalized version of the
		"Pathmox" algorithm to approach different methodologies: linear
		regression and least absolute regression models.
