		Modeling, Standardization and Testing for Provider Profiling //
		Implements linear and generalized linear models for provider
		profiling, incorporating both fixed and random effects. For
		large-scale providers, the linear profiled-based method and the
		SerBIN method for binary data reduce the computational burden.
		Provides post-modeling features, such as indirect and direct
		standardization measures, hypothesis testing, confidence
		intervals, and post-estimation visualization. For more
		information, see Wu et al. (2022) doi:10.1002/sim.9387.
