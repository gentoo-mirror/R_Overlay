		Client for the 'Povcalnet' API // Provides an interface to
		compute poverty and inequality indicators for more than 160
		countries and regions from the World Bank's database of
		household surveys. It has the same functionality as the
		'Povcalnet' website
		(http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/). 'Povcalnet' is a
		computational tool that allows users to estimate poverty rates
		for regions, sets of countries or individual countries, over
		time and at any poverty line. 'Povcalnet' is managed jointly by
		the data and research group in the World Bank's development
		economics division. It draws heavily upon a strong
		collaboration with the poverty and equity global practice,
		which is responsible for the gathering and harmonization of the
		underlying survey data.
