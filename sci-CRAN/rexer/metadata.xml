		Random Exercises and Exams Generator // The main purpose of this
		package is to streamline the generation of exams that include
		random elements in exercises. Exercises can be defined in a
		table, based on text and figures, and may contain gaps to be
		filled with provided options. Exam documents can be generated
		in various formats. It allows us to generate a version for
		conducting the assessment and another version that facilitates
		correction, linked through a code.
