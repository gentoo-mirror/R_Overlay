		An R6 Class to Perform Analysis on Long Tidy Data // Transforms
		long data into a matrix form to allow for ease of input into
		modelling packages for regression, principal components,
		imputation or machine learning. It does this by pivoting on
		user defined columns, generating a key-value table for variable
		names to ensure one-to-one mappings are preserved. It is
		particularly useful when the indicator names in the columns are
		long descriptive strings, for example "Energy imports, net (%
		of energy use)". High level analysis wrapper functions for
		correlation and principal components analysis are provided.
