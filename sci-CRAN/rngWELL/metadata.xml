		Toolbox for WELL Random Number Generators // It is a dedicated
		package to WELL pseudo random generators, which were introduced
		in Panneton et al. (2006), ``Improved Long-Period Generators
		Based on Linear Recurrences Modulo 2'', see
		doi:10.1145/1132973.1132974. But this package is not intended
		to be used directly, you are strongly __encouraged__ to use the
		'randtoolbox' package, which depends on this package.
