		toolbox for WELL random number generators. // It is a dedicated
		package to WELL pseudo random generators, which were introduced
		in Panneton et al. (2006), ``Improved Long-Period Generators
		Based on Linear Recurrences Modulo 2'', ACM Transactions on
		Mathematical Software. But this package is not intended to be
		used directly, you are strongly __encouraged__ to use the
		'randtoolbox' package, which depends on this package.
