		A Toolkit for Using Peptide Sequences in Machine Learning // This
		toolkit is designed for manipulation and analysis of peptides.
		It provides functionalities to assist researchers in peptide
		engineering and proteomics. Users can manipulate peptides by
		adding amino acids at every position, count occurrences of each
		amino acid at each position, and transform amino acid counts
		based on probabilities. The package offers functionalities to
		select the best versus the worst peptides and analyze these
		peptides, which includes counting specific residues, reducing
		peptide sequences, extracting features through One Hot Encoding
		(OHE), and utilizing Quantitative Structure-Activity
		Relationship (QSAR) properties (based in the package 'Peptides'
		by Osorio et al. (2015) doi:10.32614/RJ-2015-001). This package
		is intended for both researchers and bioinformatics enthusiasts
		working on peptide-based projects, especially for their use
		with machine learning.
