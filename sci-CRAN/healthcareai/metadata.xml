		Tools for Healthcare Machine Learning // Aims to make machine
		learning in healthcare as easy as possible. You can develop
		customized, reliable, high-performance machine learning models
		with minimal code. Models are created with automatic
		preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm selection
		(between 'xgboost' Chen, T.  Guestrin, C. (2016)
		arXiv:1603.02754, 'ranger' Wright, M. N.,  Ziegler, A. (2017)
		doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01, and 'glm' Friedman J, Hastie T,
		Tibshirani R. (2010) doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01) so that they
		can be easily put into production. Additionally, there are
		tools to help understand how a model makes its predictions,
		select prediction threshholds for operational use, and evaluate
		model performance over time. Code uses 'tidyverse' syntax and
		most methods have an associated visualization.
