		Markov Regime Switching Copula Models Estimation and Goodness-of-
		Fit // Estimation procedures and goodness-of-fit test for
		several Markov regime switching models and mixtures of
		bivariate copula models. The goodness-of-fit test is based on a
		Cramer-von Mises statistic and uses Rosenblatt's transform and
		parametric bootstrap to estimate the p-value. The proposed
		methodologies are described in Nasri, Remillard and Thioub
		(2020) doi:10.1002/cjs.11534.
