		Markov Regime Switching Copula Models Estimation and Goodness of
		Fit // R functions to estimate and perform goodness of fit test
		for several Markov regime switching and mixture bivariate
		copula models. The goodness of fit test is based on a Cramer
		von Mises statistic and uses the Rosenblatt transform and
		parametric bootstrap to estimate the p-value. The estimation of
		the copula parameters are based on the pseudo-maximum
		likelihood method using pseudo-observations defined as
		normalized ranks.
