		Structurally Guided Sampling // Structurally guided sampling
		(SGS) approaches for airborne laser scanning (ALS; LIDAR).
		Primary functions provide means to generate data-driven
		stratifications  methods for allocating samples. Intermediate
		functions for calculating and extracting important information
		about input covariates and samples are also included.
		Processing outcomes are intended to help forest and
		environmental management practitioners better optimize field
		sample placement as well as assess and augment existing sample
		networks in the context of data distributions and conditions.
		ALS data is the primary intended use case, however any
		rasterized remote sensing data can be used, enabling data-
		driven stratifications and sampling approaches.
