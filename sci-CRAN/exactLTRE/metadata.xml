		An Exact Method for Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE)
		Analysis // Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs) are a
		method of comparative demographic analysis. The purpose is to
		quantify how the difference or variance in vital rates (stage-
		specific survival, growth, and fertility) among populations
		contributes to difference or variance in the population growth
		rate, "lambda." We provide functions for one-way fixed design
		and random design LTRE, using either the classical methods that
		have been in use for several decades, or an fANOVA-based exact
		method that directly calculates the impact on lambda of changes
		in matrix elements, for matrix elements and their interactions.
		The equations and descriptions for the classical methods of
		LTRE analysis can be found in Caswell (2001, ISBN: 0878930965),
		and the fANOVA-based exact methods are described in Hernandez
		et al. (2023) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14065. We also provide some
		demographic functions, including generation time from Bienvenu
		and Legendre (2015) doi:10.1086/681104. For implementation of
		exactLTRE where all possible interactions are calculated, we
		use an operator matrix presented in Poelwijk, Krishna, and
		Ranganathan (2016) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004771.
