		Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection // Uniform manifold
		approximation and projection is a technique for dimension
		reduction. The algorithm was described by McInnes and Healy
		(2018) in arXiv:1802.03426. This package provides an interface
		for two implementations. One is written from scratch, including
		components for nearest-neighbor search and for embedding. The
		second implementation is a wrapper for 'python' package 'umap-
		learn' (requires separate installation, see vignette for more
		details).
