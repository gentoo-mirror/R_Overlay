		Fitting Dose-Response Models Using an Evolutionary Algorithm //
		Fits dose-response models using an evolutionary algorithm to
		estimate the model parameters. The procedure currently can fit
		3-parameter, 4-parameter, and 5-parameter log-logistic models
		as well as exponential models. Functions are also provided to
		plot, make predictions, and calculate confidence intervals for
		the resulting models. For details see "Nonlinear Dose-response
		Modeling of High-Throughput Screening Data Using an
		Evolutionary Algorithm", Ma, J., Bair, E., Motsinger-Reif, A.;
		Dose-Response (In press).
