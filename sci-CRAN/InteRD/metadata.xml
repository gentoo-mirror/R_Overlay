		The Integrated and Robust Deconvolution // We developed the
		Integrated and Robust Deconvolution algorithm to infer cell-
		type proportions from target bulk RNA-seq data. This package is
		able to effectively integrate deconvolution results from
		multiple scRNA-seq datasets and calibrates estimates from
		reference-based deconvolution by taking into account extra
		biological information as priors. Moreover, the proposed
		algorithm is robust to inaccurate external information imposed
		in the deconvolution system.
