		Multiresolution Kriging Based on Markov Random Fields // Methods
		for the interpolation of large spatial datasets. This package
		follows a "fixed rank Kriging" approach using a large number of
		basis functions and provides spatial estimates that are
		comparable to standard families of covariance functions. Using
		a large number of basis functions allows for estimates that can
		come close to interpolating the observations (a spatial model
		with a small nugget variance.)  Moreover, the covariance model
		for this method can approximate the Matern covariance family
		but also allows for a multi-resolution model and supports
		efficient computation of the profile likelihood for estimating
		covariance parameters. This is accomplished through compactly
		supported basis functions and a Markov random field model for
		the basis coefficients. These features lead to sparse matrices
		for the computations and this package makes of the R spam
		package for this. An extension of this version over previous
		ones (  5.4 ) is the support for different geometries besides a
		rectangular domain. The Markov random field approach combined
		with a basis function representation makes the implementation
		of different geometries simple where only a few specific
		functions need to be added with most of the computation and
		evaluation done by generic routines that have been tuned to be
		efficient.  One benefit of the LatticeKrig model/approach is
		the facility to do unconditional and conditional simulation of
		the field for large numbers of arbitrary points. There is also
		the flexibility for estimating non-stationary covariances and
		also the case when the observations are a linear combination
		(e.g. an integral) of the spatial process.  Included are
		generic methods for prediction, standard errors for prediction,
		plotting of the estimated surface and conditional and
		unconditional simulation.
