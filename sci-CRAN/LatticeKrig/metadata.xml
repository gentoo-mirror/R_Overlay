		Multiresolution Kriging Based on Markov Random Fields //
		Functions for the interpolation of large spatial datasets. This
		package follows a "fixed rank Kriging" approach using a large
		number of basis functions and provides spatial estimates that
		are comparable to standard families of covariance functions.
		Using a large number of basis functions allows for estimates
		that can come close to interpolating the observations (a
		spatial model with a small nugget variance.)  Moreover, the
		covariance model for this method can approximate the Matern
		covariance family but also allows for a multi-resolution model
		and supports efficient computation of the profile likelihood
		for estimating covariance parameters. This is accomplished
		through compactly supported basis functions and a Markov random
		field model for the basis coefficients. These features lead to
		sparse matrices for the computations. An extension of this
		version over previous ones (  5.4 ) is the support for
		different geometries besides a rectangular domain. One benefit
		of the LatticeKrig model/approach is the facility to do
		unconditional and conditional simulation of the field for large
		numbers of arbitrary points. There is also the flexibility for
		estimating non-stationary covariances. Included are generic
		methods for prediction, standard errors for prediction,
		plotting of the estimated surface and conditional and
		unconditional simulation.
