		Store Data Specification as YAML // A data specification is
		useful both for developing and documenting data.  The 'yamlet'
		package reads YAML-formatted metadata and applies it as data
		item attributes. Data and metadata are stored independently and
		optionally associated by naming conventions.  For compact
		representation, keys label and guide are assigned by default to
		the first two anonymous values for  each named item. Defaults
		can be over-ridden by stored metadata or by function arguments.
		See package?yamlet and ?decorate.data.frame.
