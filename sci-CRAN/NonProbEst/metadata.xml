		Estimation in Nonprobability Sampling // Different inference
		procedures are proposed in the literature to correct for
		selection bias that might be introduced with non-random
		selection mechanisms. A class of methods to correct for
		selection bias is to apply a statistical model to predict the
		units not in the sample (super-population modeling). Other
		studies use calibration or Statistical Matching (statistically
		match nonprobability and probability samples). To date, the
		more relevant methods are weighting by Propensity Score
		Adjustment (PSA). The Propensity Score Adjustment method was
		originally developed to construct weights by estimating
		response probabilities and using them in HorvitzThompson type
		estimators. This method is usually  used by combining a non-
		probability sample with a reference sample to construct
		propensity models for the non-probability sample. Calibration
		can be used in a posterior way to adding  information of
		auxiliary variables. Propensity scores in PSA are usually
		estimated using logistic regression models. Machine learning
		classification algorithms can be used as alternatives for
		logistic regression as a technique to estimate propensities.
		The package 'NonProbEst' implements some of these methods and
		thus provides a wide options to work with data coming from a
		non-probabilistic sample.
