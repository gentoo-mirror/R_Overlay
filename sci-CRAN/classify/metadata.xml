		Classification Accuracy and Consistency under IRT models. // IRT
		classification uses the probability that candidates of a given
		ability, will answer correctly questions of a specified
		difficulty to calculate the probability of their achieving
		every possible score in a test. Due to the IRT assumption of
		conditional independence (that is every answer given is assumed
		to depend only on the latent trait being measured) the
		probability of candidates achieving these potential scores can
		be expressed by multiplication of probabilities for item
		responses for a given ability. Once the true score and the
		probabilities of achieving all other scores have been
		determined for a candidate the probability of their score lying
		in the same category as that of their true score
		(classification accuracy), or the probability of consistent
		classification in a category over administrations
		(classification consistency), can be calculated.
