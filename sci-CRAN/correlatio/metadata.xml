		Visualize Details Behind Pearson's Correlation Coefficient //
		Helps visualizing what is summarized in Pearson's correlation
		coefficient. That is, it visualizes its main constituent,
		namely the distances of the single values to their respective
		mean. The visualization thereby shows what the etymology of the
		word correlation contains: In pairwise combination, bringing
		back (see package Vignette for more details). I hope that the
		'correlatio' package may benefit some people in understanding
		and critically evaluating what Pearson's correlation
		coefficient summarizes in a single number, i.e., to what degree
		and why Pearson's correlation coefficient may (or may not) be
		warranted as a measure of association.
