		Mediation, Moderation and Moderated-Mediation After Model Fitting
		// Computes indirect effects, conditional effects, and
		conditional indirect effects in a structural equation model or
		path model after model fitting, with no need to define any user
		parameters or label any paths in the model syntax, using the
		approach presented in Cheung and Cheung (2024)
		doi:10.3758/s13428-023-02224-z. Can also form bootstrap
		confidence intervals by doing bootstrapping only once and
		reusing the bootstrap estimates in all subsequent computations.
		Supports bootstrap confidence intervals for standardized
		(partially or completely) indirect effects, conditional
		effects, and conditional indirect effects as described in
		Cheung (2009) doi:10.3758/BRM.41.2.425 and Cheung, Cheung, Lau,
		Hui, and Vong (2022) doi:10.1037/hea0001188. Model fitting can
		be done by structural equation modeling using lavaan() or
		regression using lm().
