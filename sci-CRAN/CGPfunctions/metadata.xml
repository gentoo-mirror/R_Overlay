		Statistics // Miscellaneous functions useful for teaching
		statistics as well as actually practicing the art. They
		typically are not new methods but rather wrappers around either
		base R or other packages. Currently contains: 'Plot2WayANOVA'
		which as the name implies conducts a 2 way ANOVA and plots the
		results using 'ggplot2'. 'neweta' which is a helper function
		that appends the results of a Type II eta squared calculation
		onto a classic ANOVA table. Mode which finds the modal value in
		a vector of data. 'SeeDist' which wraps around 'ggplot2' to
		provide visualizations of univariate data.
