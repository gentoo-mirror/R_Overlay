		Time-Weighted Averaging for Interval Data // Perform fast and
		memory efficient time-weighted averaging of values measured
		over intervals into new arbitrary intervals. This package is
		useful in the context of data measured or represented as
		constant values over intervals on a one-dimensional discrete
		axis (e.g. time-integrated averages of a curve over defined
		periods). This package was written specifically to deal with
		air pollution data recorded or predicted as averages over
		sampling periods. Data in this format often needs to be shifted
		to non-aligned periods or averaged up to periods of longer
		duration (e.g. averaging data measured over sequential non-
		overlapping periods to calendar years).
