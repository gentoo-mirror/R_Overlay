		Random Subspace Ensemble Classification // We propose a flexible
		ensemble classification framework, RaSE algorithm, for the
		sparse classification problem. In RaSE algorithm, for each weak
		learner, some random subspaces are generated and the optimal
		one is chosen to train the model on the basis of some
		criterion. To be adapted to the problem, a novel criterion,
		ratio information criterion (RIC) is put up with based on
		Kullback-Leibler divergence. Besides minimizing RIC, multiple
		criteria can be applied, for instance, minimizing extended
		Bayesian information criterion (eBIC), minimizing training
		error, minimizing the validation error, minimizing the cross-
		validation error, minimizing leave-one-out error. And the
		choices of base classifiers are also various, for instance,
		linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis,
		k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, decision trees, random
		forest, support vector machines. RaSE algorithm can also be
		applied to do feature ranking, providing us the importance of
		each feature based on the selected percentage in multiple
		subspaces. In addition, to relax the requirement of the number
		of random subspaces to be generated, we propose an iterative
		version of RaSE, which is shown to be effective under many
		sparse binary classification settings.
