		Measuring Concreteness in Natural Language // Models for
		detecting concreteness in natural language. This package is
		built in support of Yeomans (2020) doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/DYZN6,
		which reviews linguistic models of concreteness in several
		domains. Here, we provide an implementation of the best-
		performing domain-general model (from Brysbaert et al., (2014)
		doi:10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5) as well as two pre-trained
		models for the feedback and plan-making domains.
