		Partial Function Application with %%, %-%, and %% // Partial
		application is the process of reducing the arity of a function
		by fixing one or more arguments, thus creating a new function
		lacking the fixed arguments. The curry package provides three
		different ways of performing partial function application by
		fixing arguments from either end of the argument list (currying
		and tail currying) or by fixing multiple named arguments
		(partial application). This package provides this functionality
		through the %%, %-%, and %% operators which allows for a
		programming style comparable to modern functional languages.
		Compared to other implementations such a purrr::partial() the
		operators in curry composes functions with named arguments,
		aiding in autocomplete etc.
