		Irish Grid Reference Utilities // Convert between Irish grid
		references and Irish Grid coordinates. Irish grid references
		can also be converted to or from an 'sf' object in any
		coordinate reference system. Precisions from 1 m to 100 km
		including 2 km (tetrads) are supported, as are datasets with
		mixed precision. Conversion to 'sf' polygons is precision-
		aware.
