		Consensus Value Constructor // An implementation of the
		International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) generalized
		consensus estimators used to assign the reference value in a
		key comparison exercise. This can also be applied to any
		interlaboratory study. Given a set of different sources,
		primary laboratories or measurement methods this package
		provides an evaluation of the variance components according to
		the selected statistical method for consensus building. It also
		implements the comparison among different consensus builders
		and evaluates the participating method or sources against the
		consensus reference value. Based on a diverse set of
		references, DerSimonian-Laird (1986)
		doi:10.1016/0197-2456(86)90046-2, Vangel-Ruhkin (1999)
		doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00129.x, for a complete list of
		references look at the reference section in the package
		documentation.
