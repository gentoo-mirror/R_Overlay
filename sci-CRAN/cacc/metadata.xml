		Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations // A set of functions
		to conduct Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations (CACC)
		as described in Miethe, Hart, and Regoeczi (2008)
		doi:10.1007/s10940-008-9044-8, and identify and quantify
		situational clustering in dominant case configurations as
		described in Hart (2019) doi:10.1177/0011128719866123.
		Initially conceived as an exploratory technique for
		multivariate analysis of categorical data, CACC has developed
		to include formal statistical tests that can be applied in a
		wide variety of contexts. This technique allows examining
		composite profiles of different units of analysis in an
		alternative way to variable-oriented methods.
