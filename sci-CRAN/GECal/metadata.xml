		Generalized Entropy Calibration // Generalized Entropy
		Calibration produces calibration weights using generalized
		entropy as the objective function for optimization. This
		approach, as implemented in the 'GECal' package, is based on
		Kwon, Kim, and Qiu (2024) doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.01076. Unlike
		traditional methods, 'GECal' incorporates design weights into
		the constraints to maintain design consistency, rather than
		including them in the objective function itself.
