		Variational Inference for High-Dimensional Joint Frailty Model //
		Joint frailty models have been widely used to study the
		associations between recurrent events and a survival outcome.
		However, existing joint frailty models only consider one or a
		few recurrent events and cannot deal with high-dimensional
		recurrent events. This package can be used to fit our recently
		developed penalized joint frailty model that can handle high-
		dimensional recurrent events. Specifically, an adaptive lasso
		penalty is imposed on the parameters for the effects of the
		recurrent events on the survival outcome, which allows for
		variable selection. Also, our algorithm is computationally
		efficient, which is based on the Gaussian variational
		approximation method.
