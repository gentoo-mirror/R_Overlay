		Group-Adaptive Elastic Net Penalised Generalised Linear Models //
		Fit linear and logistic regression models penalised with group-
		adaptive elastic net penalties. The group penalties correspond
		to groups of covariates defined by a co-data group set. The
		method accommodates inclusion of unpenalised covariates and
		overlapping groups. See Van Nee et al. (2021) arXiv:2101.03875.
