		Applied Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Functions // Provides
		functions that allow for convenient working with vector space
		models of semantics/distributional semantic models/word
		embeddings. Originally built for LSA models (hence the name),
		but can be used for all such vector-based models. For actually
		building a vector semantic space, use the package 'lsa' or
		other specialized software. Downloadable semantic spaces can be
		found at https://sites.google.com/site/fritzgntr/software-
		resources.
