		Install Packages from Snapshots on the Checkpoint Server for
		Reproducibility // The goal of checkpoint is to solve the
		problem of package reproducibility in R. Specifically,
		checkpoint allows you to install packages as they existed on
		CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time
		machine. To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function
		installs the packages required or called by your project and
		scripts to a local library exactly as they existed at the
		specified point in time. Only those packages are available to
		your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
		later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone
		using checkpoint's checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility
		of your scripts or projects at any time. To create the snapshot
		archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft refreshes the
		Austria CRAN mirror, on the "Microsoft R Archived Network"
		server (https://mran.microsoft.com/). Immediately after
		completion of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a
		snapshot, thus creating the archive. Snapshot archives exist
		starting from 2014-09-17.
