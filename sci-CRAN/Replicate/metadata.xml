		Statistical Metrics for Multisite Replication Studies // For a
		multisite replication project, computes the consistency metric
		P_orig, which is the probability that the original study would
		observe an estimated effect size as extreme or more extreme
		than it actually did, if in fact the original study were
		statistically consistent with the replications. Other
		recommended metrics are: (1) the probability of a true effect
		of scientifically meaningful size in the same direction as the
		estimate the original study; and (2) the probability of a true
		effect of meaningful size in the direction opposite the
		original study's estimate. These two can be computed using the
		package \code{MetaUtility::prop_stronger}. Additionally
		computes older metrics used in replication projects (namely
		expected agreement in "statistical significance" between an
		original study and replication studies as well as prediction
		intervals for the replication estimates). See Mathur and
		VanderWeele (under review; https://osf.io/apnjk/) for details.
