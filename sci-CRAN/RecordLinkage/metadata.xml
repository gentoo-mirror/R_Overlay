		Record Linkage Functions for Linking and Deduplicating Data Sets
		// Provides functions for linking and deduplicating data sets.
		Methods based on a stochastic approach are implemented as well
		as classification algorithms from the machine learning domain.
		For details, see our paper "The RecordLinkage Package:
		Detecting Errors in Data" Sariyar M / Borg A (2010)
