		Multi-Locus Random-SNP-Effect Mixed Linear Model Tools for
		Genome-Wide Association Study // Conduct multi-locus genome-
		wide association study under the framework of random-SNP-effect
		mixed linear model (mrMLM). First, each marker on the genome is
		scanned. Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent
		selection criterion for significant test. Then, all the markers
		that are potentially associated with the trait are included in
		a multi-locus model, their effects are estimated by empirical
		Bayes and true Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTN) are
		identified by likelihood ratio test. Wen YJ, Zhang H, Ni YL,
