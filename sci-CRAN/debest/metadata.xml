		Duration Estimation for Biomarker Enrichment Studies and Trials
		// A general framework using mixture Weibull distributions to
		accurately predict biomarker-guided trial duration accounting
		for heterogeneous population. Extensive simulations are
		performed to evaluate the impact of heterogeneous population
		and the dynamics of biomarker characteristics and disease on
		the study duration. Several influential parameters including
		median survival time, enrollment rate, biomarker prevalence and
		effect size are identified. Efficiency gains of biomarker-
		guided trials can be quantitatively compared to the traditional
		all-comers design. For reference, see Zhang et al. (2024)
		arXiv:2401.00540.
