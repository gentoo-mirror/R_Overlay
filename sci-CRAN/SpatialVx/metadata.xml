		Spatial Forecast Verification // Spatial forecast verification
		refers to verifying weather forecasts when the verification set
		(forecast and observations) is on a spatial field, usually a
		high-resolution gridded spatial field.  Most of the functions
		here require the forecast and observed fields to be gridded and
		on the same grid. For a thorough review of most of the methods
		in this package, please see Gilleland et al. (2009) doi:
		10.1175/2009WAF2222269.1 and for a tutorial on some of the main
		functions available here, see Gilleland (2022) doi:
