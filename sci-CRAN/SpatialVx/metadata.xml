		Spatial Forecast Verification // Spatial forecast verification
		refers to verifying weather forecasts when the verification set
		(forecast and observations) is on a spatial field, usually a
		high-resolution gridded spatial field.  Most of the functions
		here require the forecast and observed fields to be gridded and
		on the same grid.  For a thorough review of most of the methods
		in this package, please see Gilleland et al. (2009) doi:
